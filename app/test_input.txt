10034391	I Accuse My Parents	I Accuse My Parents is a 1944 American exploitation film dealing with juvenile delinquency. Produced by PRC, the film was used to teach morals, specifically that parents should take an interest in their children's lives, as well as the consequences (both emotionally and psychologically) of child neglect. It premiered on November 4, 1944 and was released generally on October 27, 1945. ==Plot== Mild-mannered teen James "Jimmy" Wilson (Robert Lowell) appears before a judge on charges of manslaughter. When asked to speak in his own defense, he pauses, and reflects to say; "I accuse my parents" for not giving him the home life he should have had. The film then flashes back to a day in high school, when Jim was given an award for an essay describing the ideal home he supposedly has. Eager to tell his parents, he goes home to a house full of empty liquor bottles, and parents distracted by arguing with each other. Jimmy is embarrassed when his mother (Vivienne Osbourne) shows up drunk to the graduation planning committee. Later, his father (John Miljan) gives him money instead of celebrating his birthday with him. Jim gets a job selling shoes after school and meets torch singer Kitty Reed (Mary Beth Hughes). He delivers a pair of shoes to her house and then meets her later at the nightclub where she works. The two begin dating, Jim unaware that Kitty is also the moll of gangster Charles Blake (George Meeker), who specializes in fencing stolen jewelry. Blake identifies Jimmy as sufficiently gullible and recruits him to deliver packages and messages after work and school. Jim gets paid highly for his errands, so he never questions what exactly he is delivering. Charles forces Kitty to break up with Jimmy after he realizes their relationship is becoming serious. Shortly afterward, Jim drives two of Charlie's henchmen to a late-night "errand," which turns out to be a robbery in which a night watchman is shot. Realizing what he's gotten himself involved with, Jimmy turns to his father, who rebuffs him. Jimmy confronts Blake himself, but Blake threatens to kill him if he does not continue working for him. After the police identify Jimmy as the driver of the getaway car, Blake sends his men to kill Jimmy, but the execution is interrupted, when two passersby happen upon the scene, causing the men to flee and leave behind a beaten Jimmy. Fearing for his life, Jimmy packs a suitcase and spends an indeterminate amount of time hitchhiking and train-hopping. He ends up in a small town where he attempts to rob a diner, but the kindly owner, Al (George Lloyd), recognizes Jimmy as a good boy in a bad situation, and offers him safe harbor and a job, as long as he agrees to give up crime and start going to church. After a period of living and working for Al, Jimmy's life straightens up and he confesses to his crimes. Al agrees to accompany Jimmy back home to turn himself in. Back in Jimmy's hometown, Al takes him to confront Kitty, who confesses that she was forced to break up with him. Jimmy then goes to confront Blake one more time, in the hopes that Blake will also turn himself in to help clear Jimmy's name. Blake refuses and instead pulls a gun on Jimmy; Jimmy attempts to wrestle the gun away, accidentally shooting and killing Blake in the process. The police, alerted by Al, storm Blake's hideout and arrest his men, along with Jimmy. Back in the present, the judge, understanding why Jimmy accuses his parents, acquits Jimmy of manslaughter. However, the judge also finds him guilty on charges of possession of stolen property, gives him a five-year suspended sentence and two years' probation and remands him to the custody of his parents until he is twenty-one. The judge then addresses Jimmy's parents (and the camera), warning that any young man could suffer the same fate as Jimmy if left to neglectful parents. The film concludes with a title card informing the audience that the production company is paying all costs to send the film overseas to entertain troops fighting World War II. ==Cast== * Robert Lowell as James "Jimmy" Wilson — Student * Mary Beth Hughes as Kitty Reed — Torch singer * John Miljan as Dan Wilson — Father * Vivienne Osborne as Mrs. Wilson — Mother * George Meeker as Charles Blake — Gangster * Edward Earle as Judge * George Lloyd as Al Frazier — Diner owner * Patricia Knox as Vera Moore — Kitty's roommate * Florence Johnson as Shirley Clark * Richard Bartell as Joe Holden — Jimmy's boss ==Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode== I Accuse My Parents was featured in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000,"Mystery Science Theater released on DVD."

10134172	I Can't Hold Back	"I Can't Hold Back" is a song recorded by the rock band Survivor. It was the first hit single from their 1984 album Vital Signs (their first album with vocalist Jimi Jamison). The song peaked at #13 in December 1984 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and ranked #73 on the 1985 Year-End Billboard Hot 100. It also peaked at #1 for three weeks on the Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart.Whitburn, Joel (2004). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 8th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 616. ==Background== Like most of Survivor's hits, this song was written by guitarist Frankie Sullivan and keyboard player/guitarist Jim Peterik. While their relationship was becoming strained, they managed to set aside their differences during songwriting sessions. According to Peterik, the writing of this song was the high point of their collaborations, with Sullivan coming up with guitar riffs and Peterik forming melodies and writing most of the lyrics. Peterik had the title in mind for two years before they were able to craft it into a song. After Sullivan came up with a riff, Peterik sang the first line, "There's a story in my eyes." Sullivan then chimed in with the next line, "Turn the pages of desire." From there, they put together this song about a guy whose heart is filled with desire. Peterik says the pre-chorus on this song is what gives it a killer hook: "I can feel you tremble when we touch..." Jamison proved a worthy frontman and a photogenic face of the band, which helped the video for this song get significant airplay on MTV. Ron Nevison, who also worked on albums by Heart, Chicago and Night Ranger, produced the Vital Signs album. Peterik credits him for coming up with a very unusual arrangement on this track, mixing up sections to keep it interesting. The video, which was directed by Bob Radler, was shot in Chicago and partly based on a scene in the movie Risky Business. Jamison's love interest in the clip is Lee Ann Marie, who can be seen riding a float in the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. MTV, which had been on the air only three years, gave the video plenty of spins. == Charts == Chart (1984) Peak position US Billboard Hot 100 13 US Billboard Top Rock Tracks 1 Australia (Kent Music Report) 94 Belgium Singles Chart 18 Canada RPM Singles 19 UK Singles Chart 80 Year-end chart (1985) Rank US Top Pop Singles (Billboard) 73 ==References== Category:1984 songs Category:1984 singles Category:Survivor (band) songs Category:Songs written by Frankie Sullivan Category:Songs written by Jim Peterik Category:Song recordings produced by Ron Nevison Category:Scotti Brothers Records singles
10260905	I (pronoun)	In Modern English, I is the singular, first-person pronoun. == Morphology == In Standard Modern English, _I_ has five distinct word forms: * I: the nominative (subjective) form **I is the only pronoun form that is always capitalized in English. This practice became established in the late 15th century, though lowercase i was sometimes found as late as the 17th century. * me: the accusative (objective) forms (the accusative case is also called the 'oblique'.) * my: the dependent genitive (possessive) form * mine: the independent genitive * myself: the reflexive form ==History== Old English had a first-person pronoun that inflected for four cases and three numbers. I originates from Old English (OE) , which had in turn originated from the continuation of Proto-Germanic *ik, and ek; The asterisk denotes an unattested form, but ek was attested in the Elder Futhark inscriptions (in some cases notably showing the variant eka; see also ek erilaz). Linguists assume ik to have developed from the unstressed variant of ek. Variants of ic were used in various English dialects up until the 1600s. The Proto-Germanic root came, in turn, from the Proto Indo-European language (PIE) *eg-. Old and Middle English first-person pronouns Singular Dual Plural Early OE Late OE ME Early Late ME Early Late ME Nominative Accusative Dative Genitive *Early OE circa , late, and ME Old English and are from Proto-Germanic *meke (accusative) and *mes (dative). Mine is from Proto-Germanic *minaz, and my is a reduced form of mine. All of these are from PIE root *me-. == Syntax == === Functions === I can appear as a subject, object, determiner, or predicative complement. The reflexive form also appears as an adjunct. Me occasionally appears as a modifier in a noun phrase. * Subject: _I_ 'm here; me being here; _my_ being there; I paid for _myself_ to be here. * Object: She saw _me_ ; She introduced him to _me_ ; I saw myself. * Predicative complement: The only person there was _me_ / _I_. * Dependent determiner: I met _my_ friend. * Independent determiner: This is _mine_. * Adjunct: I did it _myself_. * Modifier: the _me_ generation ====Coordinative constructions==== The above applies when the pronoun stands alone as the subject or object. In some varieties of English (particularly in formal registers), those rules also apply in coordinative constructions such as "you and I". * "My husband and I wish you a merry Christmas." * "Between you and me..." In many dialects of informal English, the accusative is sometimes used when the pronoun is part of a coordinative subject construction, as in * "Phil and me wish you a merry Christmas." This is stigmatized but common in many dialects. === Dependents === Pronouns rarely take dependents, but it is possible for me to have many of the same kind of dependents as other noun phrases. * Relative clause modifier: the me _I'd like to be_ ; *me _I'd like to be_ * Determiner: _the_ me I'd like to be; *the me * Adjective phrase modifier: the _real_ me * Adverb phrase external modifier: _Not even_ me == Semantics == I's referents are limited to the individual person speaking or writing, the first person. I is always definite and specific. == Pronunciation == According to the OED, the following pronunciations are used: Form Plain Unstressed Recording I (UK) /ʌɪ/ (US) /aɪ/ female speaker with UK accent me (UK) /miː/ (US) /mi/ /mi/, /mɪ/ /mɪ/ female speaker with US accent my (UK) /mʌɪ/ (US) /maɪ/ female speaker with US accent mine (UK) /mʌɪn/ (US) /maɪn/ female speaker with US accent myself (UK) /mʌɪˈsɛlf/ (US) /maɪˈsɛlf/ /mᵻˈsɛlf/ /məˈsɛlf/ female speaker with US accent ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * "Etymology of I".
