"I Almost Told You That I Loved You" is the third single from Californian rock band Papa Roach's fifth album, Metamorphosis, and twelfth released single in total. ==Music video== The video is set in a brothel filled with strippers with the band playing in the middle of it. The scenes flick off in many places to acts of sexual intercourse. There are three versions of the video: the one for public viewing (without Jacoby Shaddix being whipped by his wife), the censored and uncensored version. In the end of the video a girl kisses another girl trying to escape and drops a ring that on the inside says I Love You. ==Track listing== ==Chart performance== Chart (2009) Peak position Czech Republic Rock (IFPI) 17 U.S. Billboard Modern Rock Tracks 35 U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks 20 U.S. Billboard Rock Songs 32 ==References== Category:2008 songs Category:2009 singles Category:Papa Roach songs Category:Interscope Records singles Category:Songs written by Tobin Esperance Category:Songs written by Jacoby Shaddix Category:Songs written by James Michael Category:DGC Records singles Category:American hard rock songs
