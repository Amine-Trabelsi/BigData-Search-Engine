I Can Do All Things is the premiere recording from jazz artist, composer Jeremy Warren. The album features prominent performers and composers such as Andy Milne, Lenny Pickett, Leon Marin, and Jack Cooper. == Background == I Can Do All Things features Jeremy Warren's group The Rudiment and compositions written by Warren, Andy Milne, Jack Cooper and Dermel Warren (his wife). The music captures mixes the jazz art form with the elements of contemporary popular music and is a personal journey of overcoming life's obstacles through music. The album contains the many influences from Warren's musical upbringing and musical journey from Little Rock, to Memphis TN and eventually to New York City. He was born and raised in North Little Rock and heavily exposed to music growing up. His mother is an organist/pianist where she played at his grandfather's and now currently his father's church in Little Rock. In 2003, he received a full scholarship to the University of Memphis Scheidt School of Music in Memphis, TN. He earned dual bachelor's degrees in Jazz Studies and Music Education. Warren notes his greatest and most influential musical growth happened in Memphis where he performed with numerous local/national artists as well as leading his own group every Saturday night on Beale Street for two years. Warren moved to New York City in 2013 and received his master's degree in Music from New York University in May 2015. Key connections through that school and the city such as Andy Milne and Lenny Pickett are heard on the "I Can Do All Things" recording. ==Track listing== ==Recording sessions== * March 22 and April 12, 2016, Flux Studios, New York, New York * April 21 and 27, 2016, at NYU, New York, New York ==Personnel== ===Musicians=== * Drums: Jeremy Warren * Vocal: Dermel Warren * Vocal: Gloria Ryan * Vocal (male voice): Leon Marin * Trumpet: Gil Defay * Alto saxophone: Rakiem Walker * Alto saxophone: Ethan Helm * Tenor saxophone: Lenny Pickett * Piano/keyboards: Andy Milne * Piano/keyboards: Joel Desroches * Organ: Sam Carroll * Bass: Parker McAllister * Bass: Gabe Otero ===Production=== * Producer, composer: Jeremy Warren * Producer: Dermel Warren * Recording engineer: Josh Welshman * Recording engineer: Tyler McDiarmid * Mixing and Mastering: Eric Robinson, Zosermusic * Liner Notes: Jeremy Warren * Cover art and design: Smith-Lenior Graphic Creations * Photography: Keeshan Defay ==Promotion== Kari-on Productions headquartered in Atlanta, GA is the firm handling the promotion of "I Can Do All Things" record release.

"Influences of Memphis blues can be detected throughout the recording combined with rations of R&B; and soul making for an enjoyable jaunt." Susan Frances, AXS "...a clinic from Jeremy on how to create melodic drum lines and in giving space to other artists without diminishing your own mission. Jeremy knows how to kick off an album." Travis Rogers, JazzTimes "...(Jeremy) is a very talented and soulful drummer who has a beautiful feel and a great musical understanding."
