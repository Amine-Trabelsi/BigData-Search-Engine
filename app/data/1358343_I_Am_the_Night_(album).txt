I Am the Night is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Pantera, released in 1985 through Metal Magic Records. It was made available only on vinyl and cassette, with any subsequent CD releases being bootlegs transferred from the vinyl or tape originals. It was the last Pantera album to feature lead singer Terry Glaze, as well as their last to feature a primarily glam metal sound. The band made their second music video for the track "Hot and Heavy". The album sold around 25,000 copies, which was considered high for an independent release. ==Track listing== All credits adapted from the original LP. ==Personnel== ;Pantera *Terrence Lee – vocals *Diamond Darrell – guitars *Rex Rocker – bass *Vinnie Paul – drums ;Production *Jerry Abbott – production, engineering, mixing *Tom Coyne – mastering *Recorded and mixed at Pantego Sound, Pantego, Texas ==References== Category:Pantera albums Category:1985 albums
