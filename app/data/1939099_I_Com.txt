I Com is the first solo studio album by French singer and DJ Miss Kittin, released on 31 May 2004 by NovaMute Records. It is Miss Kittin's first solo release, having previously released albums in collaboration with The Hacker and Golden Boy. As in her previous works, electro-funk and electroclash continue to be the primary genres. Most of the tracks on the album were produced by Miss Kittin with either Thies Mynther and Tobi Neumann (producers of Chicks on Speed). House music vocalist L.A. Williams raps on the track "Requiem for a Hit", the album's second single. ==Singles== "Professional Distortion" was released as the album's lead single on 17 May 2004. It peaked at number 83 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 77 on the French Singles Chart. The second single, "Requiem for a Hit", was released on 27 September 2004. It peaked at number 92 on the UK Singles Chart and at number six on the Belgian Dance Chart. "Happy Violentine" was released on 14 February 2005 as the third and final single. It reached number 84 on the UK Singles Chart and number nine on the Belgian Dance Chart. ==Promotion== Miss Kittin released the EP Mixing Me on 19 April 2005. The EP contains remixes of several I Com tracks such as its three singles. ==Critical reception== I Com received generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 73, based on 17 reviews. Joseph Shoo of Drowned in Sound commented that I Com has the "sweet attitude of sheer independent energy" while containing "neural giddiness and cerebral edginess". Likewise, Johnny Loftus of AllMusic described I Com as "the best bits and pieces of the post-everything genres have been rearranged in a newfangled data stream to represent Miss Kittin's very elusive, entirely accessible muse. The alluring result is cool, reloaded." By contrast, Derek Miller of Pitchfork noted that "some of Kittin's lyrical deficits undercut her production." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of I Com. ===Musicians=== * Miss Kittin – vocals ; drums ; programming ; synth break * Otto von Schirach – programming * Tobi Neumann – guitar * L.A Williams – vocals * Thies Mynther – piano ; bass, synths ; programming * Tobi Neumann – programming ; guitar ; vocoder ; bass * Sue.Zuki – vocals * The Hacker – programming ; hectic breathing * Florian – vocals ===Technical=== * Caroline Hervé – production * Tobias Neumann – production * Thies Mynther – production * Rashad – mastering ===Artwork=== * Wolfgang Tillmans – pictures * Miss Kittin – drawings, studio pics * Bente Schipp – graphic design ==Charts== Chart performance for I Com Chart (2004) Peak position Belgian Alternative Albums (Ultratop Flanders) 43 UK Dance Albums (OCC) 6 US Top Dance/Electronic Albums (Billboard) 13 ==References== Category:2004 debut albums Category:Miss Kittin albums Category:Novamute Records albums
