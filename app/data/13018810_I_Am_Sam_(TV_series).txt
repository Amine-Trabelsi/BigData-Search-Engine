I am Sam () is a 2007 South Korean television series starring Yang Dong-geun, Park Min-young, Park Jun-gyu, Son Tae-young, and Choi Seung-hyun in his acting debut. It aired on KBS2 from August 6 to October 2, 2007, on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 (KST) time slot for 16 episodes. Based on the Japanese comic series Kyōkasho ni Nai! (in English, Not in a Textbook! or Very Private Lesson), Yang plays a geeky, straight-arrowed, under-qualified high school teacher who becomes a live-in tutor for the troublemaking daughter of a notorious gangster, in exchange for one million won. The title is a word play since sam in Korean roughly translates to "teacher" in slang, thus the international title, I am Your Teacher. ==Synopsis== Yoo Jae-gon (Park Jun- gyu), head of an infamous gangster organization, becomes troubled by the future prospects of his only daughter, Eun-byul (Park Min-young), who refuses to study. Then coincidence or fate brings together Eun-byul and goofy-looking high school teacher Jang Yi-san (Yang Dong-geun) in a somewhat sticky situation. After finding out that Yi-san can actually inspire his troublesome daughter to focus on her studies, Jae-gon offers a deal to Yi-san: become his daughter's private tutor in exchange for one million won. The catch is Yi-san has to move in with her. And the money? It's given as security for his own life. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Yang Dong-geun as Jang Yi-san * Park Min-young as Yoo Eun-byul * Son Tae-young as Shin So-yi * Park Jun-gyu as Yoo Jae-gon (Eun- byul's father) * Choi Seung-hyun as Chae Moo-shin ===Supporting=== * Park Chae-kyung as Min Sa-kang (Eun-byul's friend) * Park Jae-jung as Kim Woo-jin (Mr. Yoo's right-hand man) * Jo Hyang-ki as Hong Dae-ri (Mr. Yoo's assistant) * Kwak Ji-min as Da-bin * Dan Ji as Ye-bin * Ban So-young as Hyo-bin * Lee Min-ho as Heo Mo-se (Principal's son) * Choi Jae-hwan as Han Tae-sung (Moo- shin's friend) * Park Chul-ho as Kim In-seol * Kim Yoo-bin as Kim Hee-chul * Joo Jong-hyuk as Ji Seon-hoo * Kim Hong-shik as Park Nam-kyu * Yoo Tae-woong as Go Dong-sool * Choi Joo-bong as Heo Deok-bae (Principal) * Park Sang-hyun as Park Han-suk * Shin Pyo as Kang Ha ==Reception== I Am Sam received average viewership ratings of around 6.5%. ==Awards== * 2007 KBS Drama Awards: Best New Actress - Park Min-young ==Source material== * Title: () * Original story: Kazuto Okada (岡田和人) * Genre: Comedy, Romance * Age rating: 10+ Oraku is a lucky man...
