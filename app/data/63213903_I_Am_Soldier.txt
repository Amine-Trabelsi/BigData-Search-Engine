They also encounter Dawn (Alex Reid), a female member of the elite operations unit. Throughout their test, they face physical and mental challenges. Only a handful of the candidates will make it to the final portion of the test, Escape and Evasion, which requires candidates to journey out into the snowy wilderness and evade their pursuers.
