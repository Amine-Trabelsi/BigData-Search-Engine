I Ain't Mad No More is the second album by Virginiaâ€“native rapper Skillz. The album featured guest appearances by Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott, Danja Mowf, Kandi, Pretty Ugly, Big Swells, Musiq Soulchild, AAries, Cee-Lo Green, Pretty Willie, Jazze Pha and Nicole Wray's brother Kenny Wray. The album generated one charting single, "Crew Deep", which peaked at #83 on Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs. Two other promo singles, "Your Favorite Joints" and "Ghostwriter," were excluded from the album but were added to its sampler release. The lack of success from the album's lead single ("Crew Deep") resulted in a cancellation of the album's U.S. release and a granted promotional release in Canada was made instead. However, Skillz would feature most of the album's tracks on his U.S. independent release, Confessions of a Ghostwriter (2005). ==Track listing== ===Leftover tracks=== *"Your Favorite Joints" *"Full Cooperation"Koslow, Jessica.
