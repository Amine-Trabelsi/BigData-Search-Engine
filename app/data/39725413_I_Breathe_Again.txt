Some scenes in which he appears naked surprised some fans. On his official website he said: "I had boxers on for part of it but in some of the camera angles you could see them. The director asked if I'd go starkers for some of the shots and I agreed. I wasn't getting off the floor for anything after that. I dread to think where the off-shoots went. They're probably with one of those When They Were Famous film companies!" ==Track listings== UK CD1 # "I Breathe Again" # "Stars Are Falling" # "The True Confessions of Adam Rickitt" (interview) # "I Breathe Again" (video) UK CD2 # "I Breathe Again" (radio edit) # "I Breathe Again" (Amen extended mix) # "I Breathe Again" (The Sharp Boys extended remix) UK cassette single # "I Breathe Again" # "I Breathe Again" (Jewels & Stone extended mix) Japanese CD single # "I Breathe Again" # "I Breathe Again" (Amen extended mix) # "I Breathe Again" (The Sharp Boys extended remix) # "I Breathe Again" (Jewels & Stone extended mix) ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1999) Peak position Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 22 Hungary (Mahasz) 9 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1999) Position UK Singles (OCC) 86 ==Certifications and sales== ==References== ==External links== * Music video on YouTube Category:1999 debut singles Category:1999 songs Category:Hi-NRG songs Category:Polydor Records singles Category:Songs written by Julian Gingell
