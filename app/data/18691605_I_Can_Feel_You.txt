"I Can Feel You" is a song by American pop singer-songwriter Anastacia. It was written by Ne-Yo and Chuck Harmony and produced by the latter for her fourth studio album, Heavy Rotation (2008). Her first new material in over three years, the dance pop song was released by Mercury Records as the album's lead single in October 2008. It became a top ten hit on the Slovakian Rádio Top 100 chart and reached the top 20 in Austria, Hungary, Italy, and Sweden. ==Background== "I Can Feel You" was written by American R&B; singer Ne-Yo and commissioned after her record company had suggested a more "urban dance" sound for her fourth studio album, Heavy Rotation. Commenting on his contribution, Anastacia elaborated in 2009: "I really didn't want to get turned down. I think the worst feeling would be asking someone to write a song for you and them to turn round and say: "No." So I was so grateful that he knew who I was and then the fact that he wrote two songs. The first tone he wrote, "I Can Feel You" was hands down like the perfect song that reflected how I was feeling about my life and my love life. It's been lovely working with him. He is a really charming and down to earth guy." In 2017, Anastacia admitted in an interview with Attitude that the song "just wasn't my vibe." ==Critical reception== This song received mixed to negative reviews. In his album review album the song's parent album, Alex Fletcher from Digital Spy wrote: "Make Anastacia relevant to the generation brought up on Amy Winehouse and The Pussycat Dolls rather than Mariah and Whitney. The low-key disco" of lead single "I Can Feel You" decent indication of Anastacia's intentions." He also compared the song to that time recent Britney Spears singles. Fletcher's colleague, Nick Levine reviewed the single: "Sadly, 'I Can Feel You' isn't the big comeback single she needs after what in pop terms is a fairly lengthy hiatus. It begins promisingly with a lightly funky disco groove, but the chorus lacks the oomph that turned "Left Outside Alone" and "I'm Outta Love" into radio favourites." Allmusic editor Jon O'Brien also disked the single release of the song: "Lead single "I Can Feel You" misleadingly suggests that this doesn't seem like a particularly wise decision. Written by man of the moment Ne-Yo, its promising opening funky beats and squelchy synths are let down by such a non-event of a chorus that it's hard to believe it's penned by the same man behind Rihanna's recent infectious chart hits. A prime example of using a star name just for the sake of it, it's arguably the most underwhelming comeback song of the year." Ian Gittins of Virgin Media praised vocal performance: "Her asbestos larynx is in full effect on Heavy Rotation, rasping through R&B-hued; lead-off single "I Can Feel You." ==Music video== A music video for "I Can Feel You" was directed by Chris Applebaum and filmed in Los Angeles.
