The song peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Composition== Boasting production from Salaam Remi, the song samples Ludwig van Beethoven's "Für Elise" and the drum break from the Honey Drippers' "Impeach the President".SamplesDB - Nas's Tracks The lyrics are positive encouraging kids to stay drug-free and to pursue their dreams, pointing to examples of powerful icons in the African- American community like Oprah Winfrey. Conversely, Nas raps about a friend who was moving up in the music scene, only to fall victim to a debilitating drug addiction that took her career and her looks. ==Music video== The music video, directed by Chris Robinson, was shot in Los Angeles, and contains footage of Nas rapping while children stand around him.

The video also contains footage of break dancing and famous Egyptian structures. ==Reception== The single received positive reviews.
