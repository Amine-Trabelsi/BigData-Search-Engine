The song was written by Ben Kowalewicz, Ian D'Sa, Jonathan Gallant, and Jordan Hastings. == Background == "I Beg To Differ (This Will Get Better)" originated from a collection of scratch vocals written by D'Sa. From there, the band transformed those lyrics into a motivational song addressing those close to them suffering from mental illness, and letting them know that everything is going to be alright. > "That message is really important. It was challenging to write, and we > worked really hard on it. Nowadays there's a lot of artists and a lot of > people saying that message in metaphor – and I love that too – but sometimes > it's just nice to just hear it the way it is and be that direct: it will get > better, stick through it.” - Ben Kowalewicz == Release and reception == "I Beg to Differ (This Will Get Better)" was released on April 3, 2020, with many believing that it was released in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
