The song represented Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 after Muscat won Malta Eurovision Song Contest 2022, Malta's national final. == Release == The song was released on 14 March 2022, after heavy speculation that Muscat would change her song.

Swedish singer Dotter, fiancée of Dino Medanhodžić, one of the song's composers, provides backing vocals on the studio version of the song. == Eurovision Song Contest == === At Eurovision === According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the "Big Five" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 25 January 2022, an allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Malta was placed into the second semi-final, held on 12 May 2022, and performed sixth, in the first half of the show. == Charts == Chart performance for "I Am What I Am" Chart (2022) Peak position Malta (BMAT PRS) 1 == References == Category:2022 songs Category:2022 singles Category:Eurovision songs of Malta Category:Eurovision songs of 2022 Category:Warner Music Group singles
