But back at work in London, Tala encounters Leyla, a young British Indian Muslim woman who is dating Tala's best friend Ali. Tala sees something unique in the artless, clumsy, sensitive Leyla who secretly works to become a writer. And Tala's forthright challenges to Leyla's beliefs begins a journey of self-awareness for Leyla. After a weekend getaway into the countryside, Tala and Leyla sleep together and the two women begin to fall in love. However, Tala's own sense of duty and cultural restraint cause her to pull away from Leyla and fly back to Jordan where the preparations for an ostentatious wedding are well under way. As family members descend and the wedding day approaches, the pressure mounts until Tala finally cracks and extricates herself. Back in London, Leyla is heartbroken but learns to break free of her own self-doubt and her mother's expectations, ditching Ali and being honest with her parents about her sexuality. When Ali and Leyla's feisty sister, Yasmin, help try to get Tala and Leyla together again, Tala finds that her own preconceptions of what love can be is the final hurdle she must jump to win Leyla back. ==Cast== * Lisa Ray as Tala * Sheetal Sheth as Leyla * Antonia Frering as Reema - Tala's mother * Dalip Tahil as Omar - Tala's father * Ernest Ignatius as Sam - Leyla's father * Siddiqua Akhtar as Maya - Leyla's mother * Amber Rose Revah as Yasmin - Leyla's sister * Anya Lahiri as Lamia - Tala's middle sister * Kimberly Jaraj as Zina - Tala's younger sister * Rez Kempton as Ali - Tala's best friend, Leyla's boyfriend * Daud Shah as Hani - Tala's fianc√© * Sam Vincenti as Kareem - Lamia's husband * Ishwar Maharaj as Sami - Kareem's younger brother * George Tardios as Uncle Ramzi * Nina Wadia as Rani the Housekeeper == Critical reception == The New York Times called the film "another weightless confection from the writer and director Shamim Sarif." Autostraddle said that it "stands out for its cultural specificity, truly stunning leads, and endless charm." AfterEllen's review notes, "While the film has a lot going for it, the script is surprisingly paint-by-the-numbers. Viewers familiar with lesbian films will be able to call the ending (and all major points of conflict) long before the credits roll. Also surprising is the number of cringe-worthy lines Ray and Sheth utter." ==Awards== * Best Feature, Audience Award - Miami Gay & Lesbian Film Festival 2009 * Best Feature - International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival Of Canary Islands, 2009 * Best Feature - Afterellen Visibility Awards * Best Feature, Audience Award - Melbourne Queer Film Festival 2009 * Best Feature, Audience Award - Pink Apple 2009 * Audience Award Best Feature Film - Fairy Tales International Queer Diversity Film Festival (Calgary) 2009 * Jury Winner Best Feature Film - Festival Del Mar, Majorca 2009 * Audience Award, Best Feature - Vancouver Queer Film Festival 2009 * Best lesbian movie - The Holebifilmfestival Vlaams- Brabant 2009, Belgium * Jury award for Best Women's Feature - Tampa International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival 2009 * Best Feature Film - Gay Film Nights International Film Festival 2009 ==See also== * List of LGBT-related films directed by women ==References== ==External links== * * I Can't Think Straight at BBFC * I Can't Think Straight at BFI * * I Can't Think Straight at Reeltime Creative Category:2008 films Category:2008 independent films Category:2008 LGBT-related films Category:2008 romantic drama films Category:British independent films Category:British LGBT-related films Category:British romantic drama films Category:2000s English-language films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films based on romance novels Category:Films directed by Shamim Sarif Category:Films set in Jordan Category:Films set in London Category:Films shot in London Category:Lesbian- related films Category:LGBT-related romantic drama films Category:2000s British films
