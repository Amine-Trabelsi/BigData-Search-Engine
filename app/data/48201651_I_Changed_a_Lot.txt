Marcus Dowling of HipHopDX said, "I Changed A Lot lacks a “We Taking Over”-style smash single to show for the incredible hit- making power of the performers present. Something just feels off in Khaled's traditional manner of creating ubiquitous pop cultural touchstones. This album is generally solid, but in lacking the groundbreaking moment we’ve come to expect from the artist/producer/chicken wing restaurateur known for being “the best,” it falls short." ==Commercial performance== The album debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200, with 25,000 equivalent album units in the United States, with 19,000 copies sold in its first week. ==Track listing== ;Notes * signifies a co-producer. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2015) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2015) Position US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) 97 ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:DJ Khaled albums Category:Republic Records albums Category:Albums produced by Danja (record producer) Category:Albums produced by DJ Khaled Category:Albums produced by Scott Storch
