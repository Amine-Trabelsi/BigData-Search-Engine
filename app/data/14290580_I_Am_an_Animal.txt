Production credits include Matthew Galkin (director and producer), Sheila Nevins (executive producer), Steven Cantor (producer), and Mikaela Beardsley (producer).

The film includes a personal perspective on the life of Ingrid Newkirk and her daily routine of balancing her own life and protecting the life of animals. It exposes her willingness to go to the extreme in her fight for animal rights. Due to her commitment and dedication to the fight for ethical treatment of animals, Ingrid Newkirk illustrates why PETA is one of the most successful animal rights organizations.

He wanted to raise awareness and encourage animal rights activism. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2007 films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about animal rights Category:HBO documentary films Category:2007 documentary films Category:People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s American films
