The style and approach to this album has given the lyrics more > breathing space and room for exploration, hence it resulting in something > more of a rap album with an electronic edge, as opposed to ‘Dance Music’ > with raps on it.” Speaking about the album's second single "Choosing For You", Metropolis told Rolling Stone “We kinda pieced together ideas from two beats Noisia had made to put this one together, I think it's the only track with a Noisia voice on it... The track is about letting the music possess you, as good music should when you hear it.” ==Marketing== ===Singles=== *"Make Those Move" is the album's lead single.

Clash said the following about the album: > Banking on the success of 2009’s enormous track ‘Contact’ and other atom > splits means a protracted patent of rap and rucking risks running thin. The > Beggars’ Orifice Vulgatron and Metropolis, MCs both, purge that possibility, > staying as seven-figure showmen you hope never take responsibility, as > ‘Foil’ appears dangerously close to doing. Meanwhile Noisia’s teeth-drilling > TKOs, flubbery aftershocks and deathly whispers vaporising lugholes, only > disappoint the Richter scale when not fully engaged or needlessly cutting > short. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;I Am Legion *Nik Roos – producer, mixing *Martijn van Sonderen – producer, mixing *Thijs de Vlieger - producer, mixing *Orifice Vulgatron - vocals, writer *Metropolis - vocals, writer ;Additional musicians *D.Ablo - vocals (16) *Strange U - vocals (14) ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2013) Peak position UK Indie Breakers (OCC) 15 UK R&B; Albums (OCC) 31 ==Release history== Region Date Format Label Worldwide 2 September 2013 Digital download, CD, vinyl Division / Owsla / Par Excellence Japan 4 September 2013 == References == Category:2013 albums Category:Owsla albums Category:Foreign Beggars albums Category:Noisia albums Category:Grime music albums Category:Glitch (music) albums Category:Collaborative albums
