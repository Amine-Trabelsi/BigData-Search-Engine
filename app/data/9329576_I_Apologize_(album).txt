I Apologize, while credited to Ginuwine, is not an official release but has acceptance to his catalog. It peaked at No. 50 on the Billboard Top R&B;/Hip- Hop Albums chart. According to the San Diego Union Tribune an article written by music critic George Varga, Music Manager Leon Derrick Youngblood SR was quoted as saying, "the album was to be a Ginuwine Presents Album, it did very well on such a low budget the album reached number 50 on the billboard charts". Youngblood and his wife Ginger both managed the recording artist, who hit number 50 on the charts. The album 'I Apologize' was released in Feb 13, 2007. ==Background== By the time I Apologize hit the shelves in 2007, Ginuwine had been working the R&B; loverman vibe for over ten years. The artist's 2000s albums don't have the cutting edge that his mid-'90s work with Timbaland possessed, but they continue to impress, offering up a silky-smooth brew of contemporary production, pulsing beats, and the artist's knee-weakening croon. The title track, one of the album's highlights, gets things rolling with its moderate, bouncing groove, one of a handful of satisfying, head-nodding tracks. But Ginuwine is at his best on ballads like "Better Days," a song that not only showcases his vocal dexterity, but swells with an inspirational fervor that tips its hat to gospel. Ginuwine's mix of old-school R&B; with a hip-hop flavored sensibility has always appealed; I Apologize is another fine example of its charm. == Sales== After its release on February 13, 2007, the album I Apologize was distributed to the stores for sale but soon after that there was a dispute regarding the copyright of the eight track (AllMusic). Apparently the CD had only three songs attributed to Ginuwine and the rest were by other undisclosed artists. It was therefore not an official release and official sales have not been concluded as this was an unauthorized album (AllMusic). == Track listing == # "Intro" – 1:06 # "I Apologize" (Melvin "Melrog" Rogers, Ted Clinkscale, Elgin Lumpkin) – 4:20 # "Since I Found U" (featuring Tommy Redding) (P.
