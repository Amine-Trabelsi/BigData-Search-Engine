I Believe in You is a 1952 British drama film directed by Michael Relph and Basil Dearden. It stars Celia Johnson and Cecil Parker and is based on the book Court Circular by Sewell Stokes. Inspired by the recently successful The Blue Lamp, Relph and Dearden used a semi-documentary approach in telling the story of the lives of probation officers and their charges. ==Plot== Henry Phipps, a retired Colonial Serviceman, takes on the job of a probation officer, and finds it a challenge. Various characters' lives are examined as Phipps and his colleagues attempt to reform (amongst others), a hardened criminal and a juvenile delinquent. ==Cast== *Celia Johnson as Matty Matheson *Cecil Parker as Henry Phipps *Godfrey Tearle as Judge Pyke *Harry Fowler as Charlie Hooker *George Relph as Mr. Dove *Joan Collins as Norma Hart *Laurence Harvey as Jordie Bennett *Ernest Jay as Judge Quayle *Ursula Howells as Hon Ursula *Sid James as Sergeant Body *Katie Johnson as Miss Mackline *Ada Reeve as Mrs Crockett *Brenda de Banzie as Mrs Hooker *Alex McCrindle as Tom Haines *Laurence Naismith as Sergeant Braxton *Gladys Henson as Mrs Stevens * Richard Hart as Eric Stevens * Stanley Escane as Buck Wilson *Fred Griffiths as Fred Crump * David Hannaford as Braxton Child *Judith Furse as Policewoman Jones *Mandy Miller as Child *Glyn Houston as Man giving directions ==Critical reception== *The New York Times wrote, "it shines with understanding and, except for a brash climactic moment, it is a warm and adult adventure, which pins deserving medals on unsung heroes without heroics." *Allmovie wrote, "the semi-documentary approach established early in I Believe in You gives way to sentiment as the film winds down." *TV Guide noted, "an engaging drama with surprisingly good performances from (Joan) Collins, (Harry) Fowler, and (Laurence) Harvey." ==References== ==External links== * Category:1952 films Category:1952 drama films Category:British prison drama films Category:Ealing Studios films Category:Films directed by Basil Dearden Category:Films set in London Category:Films with screenplays by Basil Dearden Category:Films with screenplays by Michael Relph Category:Films with screenplays by Jack Whittingham Category:British black-and-white films Category:1950s prison films Category:1950s English-language films Category:1950s British films
