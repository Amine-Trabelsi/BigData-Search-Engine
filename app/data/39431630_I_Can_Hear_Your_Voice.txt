It aired on SBS from June 5 to August 1, 2013, on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 18 episodes. Originally set for 16 episodes, due to its successful ratings, the series was extended by 2 episodes. ==Synopsis== After overcoming a difficult childhood, Jang Hye-sung (Lee Bo-young) becomes a public defender, but she is pragmatic, self-preserving, and jaded. Her life changes when she encounters Park Soo-ha (Lee Jong-suk), a high school senior with the supernatural ability to read other people's thoughts by looking into their eyes. Soo-ha gained his mind-reading ability when witnessing his father getting murdered ten years previously. His father's death had initially been dismissed as a car accident until Hye-sung, then a high school girl (Kim So-hyun), gave a decisive testimony in court despite the killer's threats (Jung Woong-in). Soo-ha has been searching for her ever since. As Hye-sung works with Soo-ha and a cop- turned-lawyer Gwan-woo (Yoon Sang-hyun), she gradually lets go of her pursuit of money and glory. Together, the unlikely team uses unconventional methods to solve their cases. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Lee Bo-young as Lawyer Jang Hye-sung ** Kim So-hyun as 15-year-old Hye-sung :Smart and hardworking, Hye-sung was raised by a poor but loving mother. After being falsely accused of causing an incident involving fireworks, she gets expelled from high school. She bravely testifies on the witness stand, causing the murderer of Park Soo-ha's father to be convicted and imprisoned. But both experiences change her, and ten years later, Hye-sung is an apathetic public defender who doesn't care about her clients and only does her job for the salary. * Lee Jong-suk as Park Soo-ha ** Goo Seung-hyun as 9-year-old Soo-ha :After witnessing his father killed (and almost getting killed himself), 9 year old Soo-ha gains the supernatural ability to read people's minds by looking at their eyes. When high school teenager Hye-sung testified in court to corroborate his testimony regarding the killer, he swore that he would always protect and guard her. He nurses a crush on her for a decade, but when he meets her again, he's dismayed to find her completely different from what he has expected. * Yoon Sang-hyun as Cha Gwan-woo :A cop who brings his idealism, empathy and attention to detail to his new job as a public defender. Though outwardly geeky and meek, he has a keen intelligence that sees new angles in his cases. * Lee Da-hee as Seo Do- yeon ** Jung Min-ah as 15-year-old Do-yeon :A prosecutor who comes from a rich, well-connected family, with her father being a judge and her mother a doctor. Do-yeon has always pushed herself to become the perfect daughter to please her parents. She was in rivalry with Hye-sung in high school and when a fireworks accident nearly caused her to lose her eyesight, she blames Hye-sung for it, despite the latter's denials. Do-yeon was also a witness to the murder of Park Soo-ha's father, but at the last minute, she loses her courage and doesn't testify. ===Supporting=== * Jung Woong-in as Min Joon-gook, the murderer of Soo-ha's father, with whom he had a grudge with.
