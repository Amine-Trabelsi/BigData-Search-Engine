I Choose Noise is the third studio album by British progressive breakbeat band Hybrid, released on 4 September 2006 by Distinct'ive Records. The album included recorded symphonic sequences by the Seattle Session Orchestra, and was produced in collaboration with composer Harry Gregson-Williams. ==Background== The album was released in the UK on 4 September 2006 and in the United States on 10 October 2006. Although a bonus disc featuring Hybrid's live show at God's Global Gathering was intended to be included, it was omitted due to time constraints and may be released separately. Hybrid's track "Sleepwalking" was also originally intended for I Choose Noise, but was omitted because it was felt not to fit into the album. The track did not become available until four years after it was originally produced, with the release of the album Re_Mixed. I Choose Noise is the only studio album by Hybrid not to be released on vinyl. However, due to popular demand, several tracks from the album were also released on 12" vinyl singles. The three releases were "Dogstar", "Falling Down", and "Dream Stalker". By 15 December 2006, all three were available through the Distinct'ive Records website. ==Track listing== ==Remixes== * "Dogstar" was remixed by Satellite Party under the name "Wish Upon a Dogstar". * "Dream Stalker" was remixed by Satellite Party.
