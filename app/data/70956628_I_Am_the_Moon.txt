I Am the Moon is the fifth studio album by American blues rock group Tedeschi Trucks Band. It is a quadruple album which was initially released in four separate parts over consecutive months in 2022: Crescent (released on June 3), Ascension (released on July 1), The Fall (released on July 29) and Farewell (released on August 26), with each album including a corresponding short film. The completed album was released via Fantasy Records on September 9, 2022 and is the band's first since 2019's Signs. Conceptually, the project is based on the story of Layla and Majnun, a romantic poem of Arabian origin about star- crossed lovers. ==Track listing== Credits adapted from AllMusic.
