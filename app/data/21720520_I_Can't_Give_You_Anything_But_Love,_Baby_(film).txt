I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby was named after a 1928 song of the same name, written by Jimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields. McHugh agreed with the use of the title song in the film, sung by Peggy Moran, but did not want to compose further songs for the film's soundtrack. The rest of the film's songs were composed by Frank Skinner and Paul Smith and included the titles "The Tomato Juice Song" and "Sweetheart of Public School 59". ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1940 films Category:1940 musical comedy films Category:American musical comedy films Category:American black-and-white films Category:1940s English-language films Category:Films directed by Albert S.
