"I Believe My Heart" is a duet between Duncan James of English boy band Blue and British soprano Keedie Babb. The song was James' first release as a solo artist, shortly before Blue went on hiatus. The song was written by David Zippel (lyrics) and Andrew Lloyd Webber (music) for use in the Lloyd Webber musical The Woman in White, which premiered the same year. Upon its release in October 2004, the single debuted and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. Outside the UK, the song reached the top 20 in Italy and also charted in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland. ==Music video== The video for the song, set in the grounds of a stately home with a maze, features Duncan James and Keedie dressed in wedding attire and looking for each other in the maze, including at nightfall. During the last section of the song, James and Keedie have found each other beneath a large oak tree. ==Track listings== UK CD1 # "I Believe My Heart" – 3:56 # "I Believe My Heart" (instrumental) – 3:56 # "I Believe My Heart" (video) – 3:56 UK CD2, European and Japanese CD single # "I Believe My Heart" – 3:56 # "I Believe My Heart" (instrumental) – 3:56 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2004) Peak position Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 8 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2004) Position UK Singles (OCC) 93 ==References== Category:2004 debut singles Category:2004 songs Category:Duncan James songs Category:EMI Records singles Category:Male–female vocal duets Category:Songs with lyrics by David Zippel Category:Virgin Records singles
