I Am Not Afraid is the sixteenth studio album by South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela. It was recorded in Los Angeles and released in 1974. Tracks 2 and 7 were also included in the 2004 album Still Grazing. ==Reception== A reviewer of Dusty Groove stated: "An excellent little record from Hugh Masekela – cut right during that perfect time when he was mixing soul, funk, and just the right amount of jazz to keep things real! The record features some nice electric piano from Joe Sample, and the best cuts have a choppy funky groove. Some cuts have vocals, but the best moments are instrumental." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Backing band – Hedzoleh Soundz *Cabasa (calabash), bells, drums (bass) – Acheampong Welbeck *Congas – James Kwaku Morton *Congas, flute, vocals – Nat "Leepuma" Hammond *Design, photography – Tom Wilkes *Talking drums, percussion, vocals – Isaac Asante *Drums (uncredited) – Stix Hooper *Electric bass, vocals – Stanley Kwesi Todd *Electric piano (uncredited) – Joe Sample *Engineer – Rik Pekkonen *Guitar – Richard Neesai "Jagger" Botchway *Mastered by – Arnie Acosta *Producer – Stewart Levine *Shekere, vocals – Samuel Nortey *Trumpet (uncredited), flugelhorn (uncredited), vocals (uncredited) – Hugh Masekela ==References== ==External links== * Category:1974 albums Category:Hugh Masekela albums Category:Albums produced by Stewart Levine Category:Blue Thumb Records albums
