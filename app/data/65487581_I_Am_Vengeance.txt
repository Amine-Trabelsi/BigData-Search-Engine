Bobby LePire of Film Threat gave the film 7 stars out of 10 and wrote, "I Am Vengeance does not break the mold, but it uses its tried and true formula to good effect. Decent action, interesting characters, and a fantastic cast make for a fun watch." ==Sequel== The film spawned a sequel I Am Vengeance: Retaliation (2020) with Ross Boyask returning as screenwriter and director and Wade Barrett reprising his role as John Gold. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2018 films Category:British action films Category:2018 action films Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s British films
