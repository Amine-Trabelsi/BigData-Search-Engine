The site's consensus states: "I Called Him Morgan doubles as a seductive tribute to its subject's jazz passion as well as an absorbing look at a fatally doomed relationship". In his New York Times review A.O. Scott called the film "a delicate human drama about love, ambition and the glories of music". In Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan noted: > "Artistic, obsessive and intoxicating, I Called Him Morgan is a documentary > with a creative soul, and that makes all the difference. /.../ Using a > dazzling blend of cinematic tools, aural as well as visual, Collin recreates > both individual lives and an entire world.

As a > piece of history and a personal journey, I Called Him Morgan is cinema to > cherish. In his 5-star review in The Guardian film critic Jordan Hoffman wrote: > "Kasper Collin's I Called Him Morgan isn't just the greatest jazz > documentary since Let's Get Lost, it's a documentary-as-jazz.

In the Wall Street Journal, film critic Joe Morgenstern wrote in his review that "Musicians sometimes paraphrase Debussy, or one another, in saying that music is the silence between the notes. I Called Him Morgan has it all—the notes and the silence, plus the music of spoken language, pitched in rueful tones of recollection." And in the Village Voice critic Alan Scherstuhl notes: "It's fitting that one of the great films about jazz centers on the re- creation of a moment. /.../ Collin and company are after climate, not weather. They steep us in our awareness that Morgan and his New York have been lost, that our glimpses of it must either be through memory or hazed-up photography — or the music itself." In her PopMatters review critic Cynthia Fuchs describes how the documentary in its storytelling deals with memories and what is possible and not possible to know: > "Helen's interview and her husband's story form a dual foundation for I > Called Him Morgan. Layering experiences and impressions, music and image, > Kasper Collin's remarkable film is less concerned with history than with > effects, influences that stretch across time, ideas that shape art. /.../ > Some viewers may be familiar with Lee Morgan's career and celebrated talent, > and others may not know how profoundly he shaped American jazz. For the > former, the film's opening with Morgan's "Search for the New Land" will > recall his 1964 album with Billy Higgins, Wayne Shorter, and Herbie Hancock, > and for the latter, the sound may be a revelation, cool, smart, occasionally > abstract. The track plays over a scene that appears abstract as well, snow > falling against a gray sky, a seeming negative image that makes the snow > look like ash. The snow looks forward and back, to the day when Helen shot > Lee in a New York club calls Slug's, open that night in February 1972 > despite a blizzard. "Search for the New Land" gives way to saxophonist Billy > Harper's recollection: "I just couldn't believe it. I didn't know what to > think, because they were always together." Harper's response to Morgan's > death echoes many you'll hear in the film, from other associates like bass > player Jymie Merritt or saxophonist Wayne Shorter, artists whose lives were > touched by Morgan, and Helen too. "I heard police had arrested her and taken > her to jail," says Bennie Maupin. "And, you know, I never saw her again." > That sense of loss lingers throughout the film. Morgan and Helen first > appear on screen as a photo, held in Harper's hand.

As much as the > interview subjects who knew Helen and Morgan tell their versions of what > happened, none has details about how the relationship began or shifted. When > bassist Paul West observes, "His life was restored by Helen and it was a joy > to watch: he was playing, he was producing, and he was living," a few shots > of Morgan illustrate: he's older, he's sober, he's working his PR. As these > images help you to imagine what people describe, they also remind you of > what you don't see. /.../ In exposing and making sense of the fragments and > fault lines of memories, I Called Him Morgan tells the stories of Helen and > Morgan—how they met, how they worked together, how they appeared to others. > It also tells a story of storytelling, how different strands come together > and fall apart, how listeners participate in that process. In this, the film > conjures visual rhythms resembling jazz, montages of image and sound > providing new ways of conceiving the movements of time, of cause and effect, > of interpretation. As it articulates loss, the movie also contemplates > understanding." Critic Lauren Du Graf states in Museum Of The Moving Image's magazine Reverse Shot that: > "I Called Him Morgan casts Helen (the "I" in the film's title) not as a > coldblooded killer, but as a sympathetic and relatable one. She rescued Lee > Morgan from a rock-bottom heroin addiction, clothed him, fed him, housed > him, and bought back his trumpet, which he had pawned for drug money. She > found him work when no one wanted to hire him, and made sure he showed up to > his gigs. She even carried his trumpet for him. By centering on Helen, the > film has a feminist streak, a badly needed course corrective for a musical > genre whose histories overwhelmingly stem from the perspective of men > worshipping at the altar of other men. Like Nellie Monk, Lorraine Gillespie, > Gladys Hampton, and Maxine Gordon, Helen Morgan labored in an invisible > economy of jazz wives who worked behind the scenes to ensure their husbands’ > success and survival. Helen's murder of Lee, the film implies, was a morally > ambiguous crime of passion, a knee-jerk collection on a vast and unrepayable > debt. /.../ The film's portrayal of Helen is also intersectional, showing > how her life was shaped by her efforts to escape poverty, motherhood, and > the limited opportunities afforded black women of her generation. The film > plumbs the unseen corners of Helen's life, taking viewers into the rural > North Carolina hamlet where she was raised. She gave birth twice before the > age of 14. An ambivalent mother, Helen left her children behind in the South > to pursue a life in New York City. She rejected the service jobs typically > offered to black women, and cultivated a community of bohemians at her > apartment, which served as an after-hours spot for struggling musicians to > crash or eat a home-cooked meal." Also the writer Adam Shatz in an article in The Paris Review talks about I Called Him Morgan as unique for its female perspective: > "There is nothing mysterious about the death of Lee Morgan, unlike Albert > Ayler's: Helen was in a crowd of onlookers when she killed him. But I Called > Him Morgan illuminates a deeper, in some ways more intriguing mystery: the > jazz life of the hard-bop era, which saw a confluence with civil rights and > Black Power. What interests Collin is not so much recording or performance > as the intimacy among musicians and their friends. This is a world we know > mostly from the work of photographers like Roy deCarava, Lee Friedlander, > and W. Eugene Smith, who spent time with jazz musicians when they weren't > performing, and captured their intimate lives off-stage. Collin's cameraman, > the gifted cinematographer Bradford Young (Selma, Mother of George, A Most > Violent Year), has clearly studied their work. Snow falling and city lights > in New York; seagulls, trees, and sunset in North Carolina: Young shoots > these recurring images in elusive, grainy textures that give the film a > moody atmosphere reminiscent of the French New Wave, a movement intoxicated > by the sounds of sixties jazz. What Collin is after, I think, is something > just as elusive as Young's imagery: the relationship between creation and > (self-) destruction. It's well known that the world of jazz musicians was > bedeviled by poverty, drugs, racism, police violence, and—a cure that could > end up feeling like a curse—self-imposed exile. What held that world > together and made artistic innovation possible is less well understood. As I > Called Him Morgan reminds us, friendship was one of its pillars: we hear > musicians remembering their times with Lee, and what they remember isn't > only music, but eating, buying clothes, and racing cars at midnight in > Central Park. They were hardly unscathed by competition, but this was partly > offset by a common artistic purpose, and by the hopes inspired by the civil > rights struggle, which Morgan evoked in his epic 1964 composition "Search > for the New Land"—a piece that provides Collin with his leitmotif. Jazz > musicians were trying to create not only a new music, but another country, > to borrow the title of James Baldwin's 1962 novel, which turns on the > suicide of a jazz drummer named Rufus Scott. They could not have done > so—they could scarcely have survived—without fellow travelers in bohemia who > shared their vision and kept them going in the most inauspicious conditions. > /.../ But the most crucial members of the scene, besides the musicians, may > have been the women, most of whom have been lost to history. /.../ Helen > Morgan was one of these women. /.../ One of the great strengths of Collin's > film is that it honors her work and struggle as a black woman from the > South: I Called Him Morgan is as much about Helen Morgan as it is about Lee. > What could have been a judgmental film about a scorned woman who kills her > lover in a jealous rage is, instead, a sorrowful, almost redemptive study of > contrition and forgiveness. We hear Helen's voice throughout the film in a > slightly hissing tape made by Larry Reni Thomas, an adult educator in > Wilmington, North Carolina, who taught her after she was released from > prison. Thomas recorded the interview in February 1996; Helen died a month > later. Warbling and grainy, coquettish yet strong, somewhat reminiscent of > Billie Holiday, her voice carries us through the film, along with Morgan's > "Search for the New Land." She, too, was looking for another country when > she left the Jim Crow South for New York, in her late teens, just as Charlie > Parker and Dizzy Gillespie were launching the bebop revolution at uptown > clubs like Minton's, and on "The Street"—West Fifty-Second Street." == Awards == I Called Him Morgan was included in "The Best Movies of 2017" in New York Times, New Yorker, Time, Esquire, Village Voice, Little White Lies, FLM and more. Esquire magazine's list of the best documentaries of 2017 placed I Called Him Morgan at the top.The Best Documentaries of 2017, Esquire The film was also included in a midyear best-of list in the Los Angeles Times and Esquire, and in similar midyear summaries in The Playlist, Thrillist and Paste Magazine, as well as several lists of best documentaries of 2017. The film was nominated as Outstanding Documentary Film in the 2018 NAACP Image Awards, as Best Documentary in the 2018 Empire Awards and as Best Music Documentary in the 2017 Critics Choice Documentary Awards. It was awarded as the 6th best documentary in 2017 Indiewire Critic's Poll and shortlisted as Best Cinema Documentary in the 2018 Grierson Awards. It has been said that I Called Him Morgan is the best reviewed Swedish produced film in the US since Fanny and Alexander. Nonetheless it didn't receive any nominations in the Swedish 2018 Guldbaggen Awards, which caused several Swedish film writers to wonder what happened. Among them was Jon Asp who wrote in the Swedish magazine Point of View: "The big robbery of the year – the entire film world would probably call it difficult provincialism – is that Kasper Collin's I Called Him Morgan is not nominated for this year's top three documentaries (or any other category)." The Norwegian filmcritic Kjetil Lismoen wrote: "Most people know that juries who pick out nominees for awards are fallible. But in this case, it borders on pure incompetence, or hurtful will. Maybe some of my Swedish film friends can tell me to what extent this is a work accident?" == Others == I Called Him Morgan is director Kasper Collin's second feature documentary.
