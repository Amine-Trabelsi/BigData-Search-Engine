I Am Spoonbender is an American/Canadian multimedia group formed in San Francisco in early 1997 by composer/multi-instrumentalist/producer Dustin Donaldson, with Brian Jackson and cub guitarist Robynn Iwata (a.k.a. 'Cup', who joined halfway through the recording of the debut album Sender/Receiver, after abandoning the guitar for synthesizers).seminal i am spoonbender interview Their musical style has been favorably compared to Brian Eno, Can, and This Heat, and touches on elements of neo-psychedelia, ambient music, electronic music, tape music, psychedelic folk, synthpop, post-rock, post- punk, progressive, math rock, jazz, noise, pop, and musique concrete, with a distinctly experimental/avant-garde bent. Their sound has evolved over time and remains distinctive, making it difficult to place the group into a concise style or genre. Dustin Donaldson has noted that most of their influences are outside of music itself, although he has mentioned being inspired conceptually by Morton Subotnick, Wire, Laurie Anderson and Devo.Art of Noise – San Francisco: CitySearch == Members == === Current members === * Dustin Donaldson: synths, drums, vocals, production 1997- * "Cup" (Robynn Iwata): synths, vocals 1997- === Current live members === * Kevin Farkas – 2nd drumset, synths * Nolan Cook – bass and synths (The Residents, Dimesland) * Drew Cook – bass and synths (Dimesland) * MA'AT – perception management and subliminatexture === Past members === * Brian Jackson: bass, synths, 1997–2000 * Marc Kate: synths, 1998–2003 === Past session members === * Dave Edwardson (Neurosis): bass on Shown Actual Size, Buy Hidden Persuaders === Past live members === * Chad Amory: bass, synths, 2000–2001 == Discography == Sender/Receiver CD/ 12" picture disc 1999 Gold Standard Laboratories (US), Mint Records (Canada) Teletwin 3-sided 12" EP, CD 2000 Little Army Records (US), Mint Records (Canada) Plastic Lips 7" single 2000 Contact (Japan) Shown Actual Size CD/12" EP 2002 Gold Standard Laboratories Buy Hidden Persuaders CD 2004 Mesmer Detector, Ltd (world) Stereo Telepathy Academy CD 2006 Helen Scarsdale Agency (world) == Live appearances == Live appearances are rare.
