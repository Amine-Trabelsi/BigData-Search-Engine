"I Ain't Got Time to Tarry", also known as "The Land of Freedom", is an American song written by blackface minstrel composer Dan Emmett. It premiered in a minstrel show performance by Bryant's Minstrels in late November 1858. The song was published in New York City in 1859. The lyrics tell of a black man in the Northern United States who is homesick for the South. He decides to return to the South, as illustrated in the chorus: :For I'se gwine home to Dinah, :Yes, I am gwine home. :Den I ain't got time to tarry, I ain't got time to dwell, :I'm bound to de land of freedom, oh, niggars! fare you well.Bryant's Power of Music, New York, 1859. Quoted in Nathan 354. The pining ex-slave scenario was a common idiom of blackface minstrelsy during the 1850s. Emmett would repeat it in other songs, including "Johnny Roach" and "Dixie".Emmett's authorship of "Dixie" is contested; see "Dixie" (song). Emmett's later "I'm Going Home to Dixie" reuses the tune to "I Ain't Got Time to Tarry". ==Notes== ==References== * Nathan, Hans (1962). Dan Emmett and the Rise of Early Negro Minstrelsy.
