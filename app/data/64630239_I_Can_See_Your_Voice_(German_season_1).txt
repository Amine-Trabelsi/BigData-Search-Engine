The German television mystery music game show I Can See Your Voice premiered the inaugural shortlived first season on RTL as a two-night pilot episode on 18 and 19 August 2020. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it was also known for airing pilot episodes involving audience without health and safety protocols implemented. Because of backlash from viewers, the show forced to halt production, bringing the first season ended prematurely, which is similar to the second season of Philippine counterpart. ==Gameplay== ===Format=== Under the original format, the contestant can eliminate one or two mystery singers after each round.
