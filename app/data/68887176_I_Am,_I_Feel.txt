She felt that the song "is a great example of the more lighthearted end of this British female duo's quirky, funky sound (kinda like a cross between Kate Bush and Prince) which adds a bit of ska beat to a pretty melody and sarcastic lyrics like "I wanna bite his head off/Yeah that'd be fun"." Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian said in her album review, "Their iron-fist-in-velvet-glove persona is mildly fetching on the kittenish singles 'I Am, I Said' and 'Alisha Rules the World'.Sullivan, Caroline (15 November 1996).
