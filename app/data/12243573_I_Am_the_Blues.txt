"I Ain't Superstitious" was recorded in December 1961 with Howlin' Wolf, Hubert Sumlin, and Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Henry Gray on piano, Willie Dixon on bass, and Sam Lay on drums. The songs "You Shook Me", "I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man", and "The Same Thing" were first recorded by Muddy Waters.

"I Can't Quit You, Baby" was not even released on Chess Records; instead it was recorded and released by Otis Rush on the Cobra record label. == Reception == The AllMusic review of the album by Bruce Eder has the opinion that the production on the album was well done, but that the original performances were still better. Robert Christgau feels that Dixon's singing ability on the album is not as good as it could be, because he doesn't need to be a good singer since he's a good composer and producer. == Accolades == The album was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1986.Past Hall of Fame Inductees .
