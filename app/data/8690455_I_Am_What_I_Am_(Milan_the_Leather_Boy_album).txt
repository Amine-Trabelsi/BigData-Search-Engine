Although Milan recorded many additional songs on later singles, this was the only album ever released in his name. This album (and its associated singles) is also notable for apparently being the only time in his career that Milan used the "Rodell" surname. ==Songwriter credits== Milan is listed as the songwriter on all tracks under the name "M. Rodell"; on the first 45, the songwriter's name is Milan Rodelle (which is presumably a misspelling).
