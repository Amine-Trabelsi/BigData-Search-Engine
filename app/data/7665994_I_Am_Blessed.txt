"I Am Blessed" is a song by British girl group Eternal written by hit songwriter Mark Mueller and Marsha Malamet. It was the second single from the album Power of a Woman and peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart. The pop ballad spent a total of 12 weeks on the UK chart in 1995 and 1996, with three weeks in the top 10 and seven weeks in the top 20. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments over 200,000 copies in the UK. It also reached number seven in Ireland, becoming the group's second top-10 hit in that country. Eternal performed "I Am Blessed" for Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in 1995. ==Critical reception== James Masterton for Dotmusic described the song as one of the group's "softer, slushier records". Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote, "Another possible chart-buster from the creme of British R&B.; The religious undertones are very suitable for the Christmas season, just like the extra track Oh Happy Day, a wonderfully updated version of the gospel traditional with a jazzy rhythm guitar and a midtempo beat." A reviewer from Music Week rated it three out of five, adding that "this silky smooth ballad has hints of I Will Always Love You, with Easther living up to Houston's standards. A hit, but not a monster." ==Track listings== UK CD1 and Australian CD single # "I Am Blessed" # "Oh Happy Day" # "Stay" (1995 D.A.R.C.
