I Am They is an American Christian music band from Carson City, Nevada, formed in 2011. The band consists of five members and was first signed to Essential Records. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2015. They were most recently signed to Big Future. ==Background== I Am They, a Christian band from Carson City, Nevada was initially formed as a worship ministry called "Solomon's Porch" for what was intended to be a single night worship gathering on October 31, 2008, hosted at Calvary Chapel Carson City. After a positive reception from the local church community, the band continued holding bi- monthly worship gatherings. After receiving an offer from local Christian concert promoters, Ian Bullis and Jonathan Velasquez, to open for CCM artist Matthew West in January 2009, the band began to write original material and formally changed their name to I Am They in order to differentiate it from the bi-monthly worship ministry they hosted. The band signed to Provident Label Group in the summer of 2013 and went into the studio in January 2014 to record their self-titled debut at Yackland Studios in Nashville, TN with Producer Jonathan Smith and Executive Producer Jason Ingram. Their debut album was released on January 27, 2015. In winter and spring of 2015, the band was a part of the national touring "Rock & Worship Roadshow" alongside MercyMe, Crowder, and Group 1 Crew, followed by a tour with Matt Maher on the spring leg of the Saints & Sinners tour. In August 2015, I Am They received a Dove Award nomination for New Artist of the Year. In March 2016, Abbie Parker replaced Stephanie Kulla as the lead female vocalist for the band. On the same day, the band released a new single "Make A Way" featuring Abbie Parker. I AM THEY released the 4-song worship EP The Resting Place - EP in June 2016. In April 2017, a new vocalist, Houston resident Jon McConnell, was introduced with the release of the band's new song, Crown Him. In early 2019, a new drummer/percussionist, Nicole Hickman, joined the group, allowing Sara Palmer to focus on planning and promotion full-time. Nicole had spent a number of years touring with Holly Starr. In January 2022, the band announced that they had signed with Big Future Music Group in a joint venture with Truss Records. The announcement also pictured and listed Cheyenne Mitchell as vocalist, in place of previous lead female vocalist Abbie Parker. ==Members== Current members * Matthew Hein – vocals, guitar, banjo, dobro, mandolin * Cheyenne Mitchell (since January 2022) * Justin Shinn – keys, organ, concert drum, banjo, mandolin, bass * Nicole Hickman (2019–present)– drums, percussion * Brandon Chase (August 2019–present) – vocals, guitar, banjo Former members * Stephanie Kulla (2015) – vocals * Bobby Stiehler – bass, percussion * Raul Aguilar Jr. – bass * Adam Palmer (2015-2019) – vocals, guitar, Nashville high- strung guitar, banjo, dobro, concert drum * Sara Palmer (2015-2019) – drums, percussion * Jon McConnell (until late 2019) – vocals, guitar, keys * Abbie Parker (2016–2021) – vocals, harmonium, keys ==Discography== ===Albums=== List of studio albums, with selected chart positions Title Album details Peak chart positions US Christ UK C & G I Am They * Released: January 27, 2015 * * Format: CD, digital download 10 — Trial & Triumph * Released: March 2, 2018 * * Format: CD, digital download 23 15 Faithful God * Released: October 23, 2020 * Label: Essential Records * Format: CD, digital download 43 — ===Extended plays=== List of EPs Title Details The Prelude *Released: August 2, 2011 *Label: Independent *Format: CD Sanctuaries *Released: February 20, 2013 *Label: Independent *Format: CD, Streaming Resting Place *Released: June 10, 2016 *Label: Provident *Format: Download, Streaming ===Singles=== List of singles and peak chart positions Single Year Peak chart positions Certifications Album US Christ US Christ Air.
