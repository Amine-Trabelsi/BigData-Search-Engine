I Come with the Rain is a 2009 neo-noir thriller written and directed by Vietnamese-born French director Tran Anh Hung, starring American actor Josh Hartnett. After making three movies about Vietnam, Tran Anh Hung intended to make a baroque action film, a passionate thriller, both intense and poetic, haunted by three characters from the mythology of film and the Western world: the serial killer, the private investigator, and the Christ figure. The action takes place in Los Angeles, Mindanao and Hong Kong and brings together American and Asian actors.Director's notes , TF1 International The film score is written by the Argentine Academy Award Winner Gustavo Santaolalla and the English alternative rock band Radiohead. The filmmaker also makes heavy use of post-rock music, including songs by Explosions in the Sky, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and A Silver Mt. Zion.

A powerful pharmaceutical conglomerate boss hires Kline to find his only son Shitao who has mysteriously disappeared in the Philippines where he had been helping in an orphanage. Kline follows the trail left by the ethereal Shitao to the jungles of Mindanao, and then to the urban jungle of Hong Kong, where he enlists the help of Meng Zi, an old police officer friend. The search leads Kline to cross paths with local organized crime syndicate boss Su Dongpo, who is making trouble for the underworld, triggered by an overriding passion for his drug- addicted girlfriend Lili. Caught in the crossfire between the Hong Kong police and Su Dongpo's mafia drug ring which is also hunting for Shitao, Kline finds himself alone, in this unknown city, when Meng Zi is victim of an assassination attempt and is hospitalised. Leaving behind his 5-star hotel for a shabby murder scene apartment in order to get inside the mind of Shitao, Kline gradually loses himself in the terrifying memories of Hasford, whose speciality was dissecting his victims' limbs while they were still alive, then reassembling them into installation sculptures. After a few weeks immersed in his haunted memories, torn between good and evil, Kline is about to leave Hong Kong when he finds Shitao, who has become a mysterious vagrant with healing powers.Synopsis , Central Films ==Cast== ===Main cast=== *Josh Hartnett as Kline *Elias Koteas as Hasford *Lee Byung-hun as Su Dongpo *Takuya Kimura as Shitao *Shawn Yue as Meng Zi *Trần Nữ Yên Khê as Lili ===Supporting cast=== *Eusebio Poncela as Vargas *Sam Lee as The Monk Artist *Carl Ng as The Dead Sack Man *William Chow Tze Ho as Mi Fu *Bo-yuan Chan as Dai Xi *Russ Kingston as Felix Sportis *Jo Kuk as The 9mm Lover *David Tang as Wang Wei *Thea Aquino as The Erotic Dancer *Alvaro Longoria as The Psychiatrist *Benito Sagredo as The Male Nurse ==Festival screenings== ;6th Fresh Film Fest Section: Contemporary World Cinema Location: Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic Screening dates: August 13, 2009 - August 15, 2009 ;14th Busan International Film Festival Section: Gala Presentation Location: Busan, South Korea Screening dates: October 9, 2009 - October 13, 2009 - October 15, 2009 ;15th Lund International Fantastic Film FestivalInternational Competition 2009 , Fantastisk Film Festival Lund 23 September - 2 Oktober 2010 Section: International Competition (nominated: The Siren Best Film)What happens at Lund International Fantastic Film Festival 2010? , Fantastisk Film Festival Lund 23 September - 2 Oktober 2010 Location: Lund, Sweden Screening date: September 19, 2009 ;3rd Empire Open Cinema Section: Selection Location: Moscow, Russia Screening dates: September 2, 2010 ==References== ==External links== * archive * * *I Come with the Rain at Box Office Mojo *International Sales (TF1 International) Category:2009 films Category:2000s crime drama films Category:2009 independent films Category:2009 psychological thriller films Category:French neo-noir films Category:English-language French films Category:French independent films Category:Films set in Hong Kong Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in California Category:Films set in the Philippines Category:Films directed by Tran Anh Hung Category:Films shot in the Philippines Category:Films scored by Gustavo Santaolalla Category:2009 drama films Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s French films
