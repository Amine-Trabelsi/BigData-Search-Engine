I Am the Actor () is a Chinese variety program produced by Zhejiang Television. The show is hosted by Zhang Guoli and Yi Yi, and features Wu Xiubo, Xu Zheng and Zhang Ziyi as mentors. The first season of the show was called Birth of Performers, and Zhejiang TV renamed the show as I Am the Actor in the second season, which began airing in September 2018.
