I Am Easy to Find is the eighth studio album by American indie rock band The National, released on May 17, 2019, via 4AD. The follow-up to the band's 2017 album, Sleep Well Beast, it was supported by the lead single, "You Had Your Soul with You", and accompanied by a short film of the same name, directed by Mike Mills and starring Alicia Vikander. Vikander is also featured on the album cover. A trailer was released for the companion film along with the announcement of the album. A tour promoting the album began in June 2019. ==Background== The bulk of the album was recorded at Long Pond studio in Hudson Valley, New York. Parts were recorded in other cities, including Paris, Berlin, Dublin, Cincinnati, Austin, and Brooklyn. The album and film, while having influenced each other, were essentially made separately. A press release stated that the album "is not the soundtrack" for the film; the idea for the album itself came after the film was shot. The album features female vocalists including Lisa Hannigan, Sharon Van Etten, Mina Tindle, Gail Ann Dorsey, Kate Stables, and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus. == Critical reception == I Am Easy to Find was met with universal acclaim, receiving a score of 81 on Metacritic, the review aggregating site. Reviewing in his Substack-published "Consumer Guide" column, Robert Christgau said that "almost every track is open to substantive female input on a musical whole that feels consistently interactive and empathetic and also not so glum—even when you can’t pin down exact meanings, it makes love sound possible." More negative critics, such as The Observers Phil Mongredien, complained about the album's flatness and inaccessibility. ===Year-end rankings=== Year-end rankings for I Am Easy to Find Publication Accolade Rank The A.V.

The song was originally titled "Washington" before Mills insisted on altering it. ===Cast=== *Alicia Vikander *Kate Adams as Young mother *Riley Shanahan as Young father ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Weekly chart performance for I Am Easy to Find Chart (2019) Peak position Lithuanian Albums (AGATA) 30 ===Year-end charts=== Year-end chart performance for I Am Easy to Find Chart (2019) Position Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders) 55 US Independent Albums (Billboard) 15 US Top Rock Albums (Billboard) 84 ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:The National (band) albums Category:4AD albums Category:Albums produced by Bryce Dessner
