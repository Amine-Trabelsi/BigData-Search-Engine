"I Believe" is a song by British house studio project Happy Clappers, featuring singer Sandra Edwards on vocals, released by Shindig, EastWest and PWL International as the debut single from the project's only album, Games (1997). The song was mixed by Nobby (aka Martin Neary) and re-released two times during 1995, before peaking at number seven on the UK Singles Chart. But on the UK Dance Chart, it was even more successful, reaching number-one in June 1995. In 1997, a remix reached number 28 in the UK. Six years later, in 2003, a remix by American DJ Chris Cox peaked at number-one on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart, finally seeing the track being released also in the US. "I Believe" remains the project most successful release to date and is by many considered a classic of its genre. ==Critical reception== Howard Cohen from Knight-Ridder Newspapers described the song as "a pounding house number with a contagious minor-key piano riff."Cohen, Howard (28 July 1995).
