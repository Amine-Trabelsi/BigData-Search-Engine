I Am Alive in Everything I Touch is the eighth studio album by Canadian post- hardcore band Silverstein. The album was released on May 19, 2015 through Rise Records (worldwide) and New Damage Records (Canada). ==Music and lyrics== Similar to A Shipwreck in the Sand (2009) and This Is How the Wind Shifts (2013), I Am Alive in Everything I Touch is a conceptual album penned by lyricist and lead vocalist Shane Told. The album is split into 4 chapters: "Borealis" (North), "Austeralis" (South), "Zephyrus" (West) and "Eurus" (East). Each track's setting is a different city that geographically falls into that region, with real life recordings of each city incorporated into the songs. Told had this to say about the album: ==Recording== The album was recorded with producer Jordan Valeriote. ==Release== On January 13, 2015 A music video for "A Midwestern State of Emergency" was released alongside the song's streaming release and coincided with the official announcement of I Am Alive in Everything I Touch. The music video was directed by Max Moore and produced by Nolan Cubero. The video begins with Shane Told (lead vocalist) in a bath of water, seemingly dead. He resuscitates as the music begins and the band can be seen playing throughout – with Told subsequently singing to himself in many places. The music video ends in the same place it begins, only with Told now on the floor spluttering water out. A lyric video for the song "Milestone" was released on March 4, 2015. This video consists of footage from Silverstein's Discovering the Waterfront 10th anniversary tour as well as images of highways and buildings. This is all overlaid by the lyrics of the song. On May 11, the music video for "Face of the Earth" was released. On May 12, the album was available for streaming, and was released on May 19 on Rise. In November and December, the band went on a co-headlining US tour with Senses Fail. They were supported by Hundredth and Capsize. ==Reception== Jonathan Diener of Alternative Press said that the album's concept didn't "overshadow" the compositions. He named "A Midwestern State of Emergency" as the group's "best work", showing off their combination of screaming verses flowing into "huge singalong choruses". He also said that "Late on 6th" broke the flow so that "monotony never sets in". The album was included on The Noise's "The 27 Best Albums Of 2015 So Far" list. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Silverstein * Shane Told – lead vocals * Paul Koehler – drums * Josh Bradford – rhythm guitar * Billy Hamilton – bass * Paul Marc Rousseau – lead guitar ;Production * Jordan Valeriote – producer, mixing, engineer * Chris Cosentino - engineer * Joao Carvalho - mastering * Paul Dickinson - drum tech * Michael Colasardo - album layout * Anna Lee - band photography * Billy Hamilton - additional photography * Martin Wittfooth – album illustrations * Anna Jarvis - cello ==Chart positions== Charts (2015) Peak position Canadian Albums Chart 18 U.S. Billboard 200 33 U.S. Billboard Alternative Albums 6 U.S. Billboard Digital Albums 22 U.S. Billboard Hard Rock Albums 3 U.S. Billboard Independent Albums 3 U.S. Billboard Rock Albums 6 U.S. Billboard Tastemaker Albums 3 ==References== Footnotes Citations ==External links== *I Am Alive in Everything I Touch at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:2015 albums Category:Silverstein (band) albums Category:Rise Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Metalworks Studios
