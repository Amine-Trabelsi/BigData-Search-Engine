"I Ain't No Quitter" is a song by the Canadian singer Shania Twain. It was the third and final single released from her 2004 Greatest Hits album. The song was written by Twain and her then-husband, Robert John "Mutt" Lange. "I Ain't No Quitter" was originally released to country radio on May 2, 2005. The commercial singles in Europe were released on July 12, 2005. With no promotion by Twain and little by the record label, "I Ain't No Quitter" is one of Twain's lowest peaking singles. Despite this, Twain performed the song on her Still the One residency and Rock This Country Tour. ==Critical reception== Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine appreciated the single and said it was "catchy as all get out, while winking in the face of a classic country theme. It's an appreciable effort that should sparkle on the summer airwaves."Billboard, May 21, 2005 ==Music video== The music video for "I Ain't No Quitter" was shot in Tijuana, Mexico, in March 2005, directed by Wayne Isham.

To keep with the country theme of the song and video, Twain wears a cowboy hat in every scene.
