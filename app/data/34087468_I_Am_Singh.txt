Sadly, the effort gets bogged down by the hysterical undertones and the preachy nature of the film which ends up essentially as a documentary on Sikhism.""I Am Singh" review John Anderson of Variety states, "A little late and more than a little goofy, "I Am Singh" splices a very serious subject—post-9/11 hate crimes against turban-wearing Sikhs—onto a Bollywood format, diluting a sobering message with hysterical dance numbers, engorged dialogue, bimbo-esque blondes and over-the-top performances."I am Singh review ==See also== *List of cultural references to the September 11 attacks ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2011 films Category:Films based on the September 11 attacks Category:2010s Hindi-language films Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films scored by Surinder Sodhi Category:Punjabi-language Indian films Category:2010s Punjabi-language films Category:Films about Sikhism
