I Can See Your Voice is a British television mystery music game show series based on the South Korean programme of the same name. Since its premiere on 10 April 2021, it has aired two series on BBC One. ==Gameplay== ===Format=== Presented with a group of six "mystery singers" identified only by their occupation, a guest artist and a group of two contestants must attempt to eliminate bad singers from the group without ever hearing them sing, assisted by clues and a celebrity panel over the course of four rounds. At the end of the game, the last remaining mystery singer is revealed as either good or bad by means of a duet between them and one of the guest artists. ====Rewards==== If the singer is good, the contestants win ; if the singer is bad, the same amount is given to the bad singer instead. ===Rounds=== Each episode presents the guest artist and contestants with six people whose identities and singing voices are kept concealed until they are eliminated to perform on the "stage of truth" or remain in the end to perform the final duet. _Notes:_ ==Production== ===Background and development=== BBC formally announced its development of the show in July 2020.
