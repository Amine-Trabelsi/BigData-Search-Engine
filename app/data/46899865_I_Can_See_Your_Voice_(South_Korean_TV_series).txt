I Can See Your Voice (abbreviated as ICSYV) () is a South Korean television mystery music game show series jointly produced by CJ ENM and Signal Entertainment Group. Since its premiere on February 26, 2015, it has aired ten seasons on two different networks — Mnet and tvN. == Gameplay == ===Format=== Presented with a group of six "mystery singers" identified only by their occupation, a guest artist must attempt to eliminate bad singers from the group without ever hearing them sing, assisted by clues and a celebrity panel over the course of three rounds. At the end of the game, the last remaining mystery singer is revealed as either good or bad by means of a duet between them and one of the guest artists. The original version has two different formats: *Original format :Under the original format, the guest artists can eliminate one or two mystery singers in each round, and the last mystery singer standing will perform a duet. *Star Wars format (season 1, special only) :Under the "Star Wars" format, ten former mystery singers were separated into two teams. For each round, a mystery singer is chosen for a "showdown". Afterward, voting is done through audience majority, and the votes are accumulated for the winning team. ===Rewards=== The winning mystery singer is awarded on the following conditions: *If the singer is good, he/she will have release a digital single. **In Global Stars special as a prelude to the fifth season, the winning singer, regardless of being good or bad, receives a microphone trophy. *If the singer is bad, he/she wins . ===Rounds=== Each episode presents the guest artist with six people whose identities and singing voices are kept concealed until they are eliminated to perform on the "stage of truth" or remain in the end to perform the final duet. Inside a semi- enclosed podium, the identity and appearance of a sixth participant (as "surprise" mystery singer) remains concealed, until its revelation by being eliminated or a duet performance by one of the guest artists. _Notes:_ ==Production== In 2012, producer and creator Lee Seon-young planned to develop a music game show. Besides with the existence of "good singers", she added "bad singers" and lip sync as format elements. Also, she was originally envisioned a program that will allow anyone to be the main character regardless of their appearances, and was inspired by Kim Bum-soo who struggled to gain recognition because of his look. ==Broadcast history== ===2015—2016: Yoo Se-yoon, Leeteuk, and Kim Bum-soo era=== In a span of three seasons, the show's hosts consist of an original lineup with Yoo Se-yoon, Leeteuk (of Super Junior), and Kim Bum-soo.
