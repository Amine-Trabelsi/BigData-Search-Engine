I Am is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Becoming the Archetype. The album was recorded between May 21 and June 17 and released on September 18, 2012 through Solid State Records. This album is a departure from the previous effort, as Seth Hecox says, "gone are the sitars and horns of Celestial Completion. Instead, we've crafted an album full of the heaviest and most technical songs we've ever written.” It is the first and only release by the band to feature Chris McCane on vocals, Codey Watkins on bass, and Chris Heaton on drums. Guitarist/vocalist Seth Hecox was the only original member from the debut album featured on I Am. The first single to promote the album was the song "The Time Bender", released on August 28, 2012, as well a lyric video and an official video. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Becoming the Archetype * Chris McCane - Lead Vocals * Daniel Gailey – Lead Guitars, Backing Vocals * Seth Hecox – Rhythm Guitars, Keys, Clean Vocals * Codey Watkins – Bass * Chris Heaton – Drums ;Production and Recording * Shane Frisby - Producer * Tue Madsen - Mixing * Troy Glessnar - Mastering ;Artwork and packaging * Dan Seagrave – Cover Artwork & Additional Paintings == Charts == Chart (2012) Peak position ==References== Category:Becoming the Archetype albums Category:Solid State Records albums Category:Albums with cover art by Dan Seagrave Category:2012 albums
