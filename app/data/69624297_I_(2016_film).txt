The film crew tried to convince them that they were unaware of the teaser's release on the satellite channel, but the IRIB's television commercial authorities simply asked for a property deed and did nothing more. The municipality made matters worse by not allowing the placement of any billboards or posters in public places which made the outdoor advertising of the movie practically impossible. On the other hand, the film's screening at the 34th Fajr International Film Festival in Mashhad was cancelled. If it weren't for the advertisements posted on the social networking platforms, I (Me) wouldn't be a box office success. The film was also ranked among the best works of the year by some film periodicals such as Film and 24. === Urban advertising and the press === Saeed Khani (producer) told ISNA that the film did not use TV, environmental and urban advertisements in any way and only managed to sell 600 million Tomans in ten days by using a team of 15 people to produce content in Social media. === Cancelling of the screening in Mashhad === I screening was canceled as part of the 34th Fajr Festival in Mashhad. === Using age ratings for promoting === Some critics have said that the phrase "watching this movie is not recommended for people under the age of 15" in the movie posters and teasers were used to advertise and attract teenage audiences to watch the movie, while the movie does not have such content. However, the agents stated that the age classification is determined by the show licensing council and its inclusion in the poster is the decision of this council. == Selling == Soheil Beirghi announced in the film's press conference that "if sales reach one billion and 10 million tomans, it will enter the profit stage." Therefore, this film, with a profit of 1 billion and 181 million tomans, has been able to more than double its production cost. To sell. The film's film monthly also called "Me" a "popular movie in theatres" which has garnered a lot of positive reviews from critics. == References == == External links == * Category:Films directed by Soheil Beiraghi
