Tagged I Can’t Believe What You Say, it’s a high-speed handclapping twister that sports a host of ultra- commercial vocal and instrumental sounds. Watch it. Backing's a soul-filled shuflle-rock blueser that Tina wails with loads of feeling." == Cover versions == * 1965: Manfred Mann released a version as the B-side to "My Little Red Book" from their album My Little Red Book Of Winners * 1965: British singer Val McKenna released a rendition on Piccadilly Records in the UK * 1967: Danish rock group The Defenders released the song as a single on Sonet Records from their album Looking at You * 1972: Toots and The Maytals released a version on their album Funky Kingston * 2000: Henning Stærk released the song on his album Hit House == Chart performance == Chart (1964) Peak position US Billboard Hot 100 95 US Cash Box Looking Ahead 134 US Record World Top 40 R&B; 33 == References == Category:1964 songs Category:1964 singles Category:Ike & Tina Turner songs Category:Songs written by Ike Turner Category:Song recordings produced by Ike Turner Category:Kent Records singles Category:Manfred Mann songs Category:1965 singles Category:1967 singles Category:Piccadilly Records singles
