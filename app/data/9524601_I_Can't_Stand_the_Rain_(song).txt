"I Can't Stand the Rain" is a song originally recorded by Ann Peebles in 1973, and written by Peebles, Don Bryant, and Bernard "Bernie" Miller. Other hit versions were later recorded by Eruption, Tina Turner and Lowell George. The original version is ranked at 197 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. ==Ann Peebles version== The song was written by Peebles, her partner (and later husband) Don Bryant, and DJ Bernard "Bernie" Miller in 1973: > One evening in Memphis in 1973, soul singer Ann Peebles was meeting friends, > including her partner, Hi Records staff writer Don Bryant, to go to a > concert. Just as they were about to set off, the heavens opened and Peebles > snapped: "I can't stand the rain." As a professional songwriter in constant > need of new material, Bryant was used to plucking resonant phrases out of > the air and he liked the idea of reacting against recent R&B; hits that > celebrated bad weather, such as the Dramatics' "In the Rain" and Love > Unlimited's "Walkin' in the Rain with the One I Love". So he sat down at the > piano and started riffing on the theme, weaving in ideas from Peebles and > local DJ Bernie Miller. The song was finished that night and presented the > next morning to Hi's studio maestro, Willie Mitchell, who used a brand new > gadget, the electric timbale, to create the song's distinctive raindrop > riff. It really was that easy. "We didn't go to the concert," Bryant > remembers. "We forgot about the concert."Dorian Lynskey, "Ann Peebles: the > girl with the big voice", The Guardian, 20 February 2014. Retrieved 30 June > 2014 Ann Peebles said: "At first, we had the timbales all the way through the song but as we played the tape, Willie Mitchell said 'what about if the timbales were in front before anything else comes in?'. So we did that and when we listened back I said 'I love it, let's do that'." Miss FunkyFlyy, "Ann Peebles". Retrieved June 30, 2014 The organ is played by Charles Hodges, who later said: "We wanted to catch a sound like water dripping. Willie pulled the timbales out and Howard [Grimes] did the low part and Teenie [Hodges] did the high part. It was an overdub."Graeme Thomson, "The Making of 'I Can't Stand the Rain'", Uncut, No.290, July 2021, pp.82-84 Peebles said: "I have to give Teenie a lot of credit, because he added a lot of licks and details to make it right." Produced by Willie Mitchell, the song became Peebles' biggest hit when, in 1973, it reached No. 38 on the US Pop Chart and No. 6 on the R&B;/Black Chart; it also reached No. 41 on the UK singles chart in April 1974. It was one of John Lennon's favorite songs; he called it "the best song ever". Ian Dury made the song one of his choices when he was the guest for BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in December 1996.
