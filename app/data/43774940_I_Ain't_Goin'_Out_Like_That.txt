"I Ain't Goin' Out Like That" is a song by American hip hop group Cypress Hill, released in December 1993 as the third single from their second studio album, Black Sunday (1993). During a scheduled Saturday Night Live performance, the song was cut short and the group was banned after DJ Muggs lit up a cannabis joint on-air just before the song. It contains a sample of the opening bars (played on a harmonica) from Black Sabbath's song "The Wizard". It was revealed that the band was high on mushrooms when this final track of the album was recorded.Cypress Hill was tripping while finishing ‘Black Sunday’ Accessed October 26, 2018 ==Critical reception== Pete Stanton from Smash Hits gave "I Ain't Goin' Out Like That" four out of five, adding, "This tune is more pumping beats and jump-up-and-down raps." ==Cover versions== In 1996, the song was covered by 16Volt for the electro-industrial various artists compilation Operation Beatbox. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1994) Peak position Australia (ARIA) 43 Ireland (IRMA) 19 Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) 6 UK Singles (OCC) 15 UK Dance (Music Week) 1 UK Club Chart (Music Week) 41 US Billboard Hot 100 65 US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) 86 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1994) Position New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) 44 ==Credits and personnel== * B-Real - vocals * Sen Dog - vocals * DJ Muggs - arranger, executive producer, mixing, scratching/turntables * T-Ray - production ==References== Category:Cypress Hill songs Category:1993 songs Category:1993 singles Category:Ruffhouse Records singles Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Songs written by Geezer Butler Category:Songs written by Tony Iommi Category:Songs written by Ozzy Osbourne Category:Songs written by Bill Ward (musician) Category:Songs written by DJ Muggs Category:Songs written by B-Real Category:Music Week number-one dance singles
