Kane 2003 edition p39 The album engaged more overtly with pop, dance and electronic styles following the group's debut Sixty Nine. Like its predecessor, "i" was released to moderate sales figures and topped the UK independent charts. ==Reviews== In a mixed 1990 review, critic Greg Tate stated that the album "seems both more rudimentary and more calculating by comparison with the organic and uncontrived otherness of 69," noting their incorporation of "various received rock, reggae, and house song-forms" and opining that "the results are spotty." The AllMusic review by Jason Ankeny called the album "breathtaking in its scope and positively epic in its ambition," and concluded that, "largely overlooked upon its original release, i is still an underappreciated masterpiece." ==Track listing== == Personnel == *A.R.
