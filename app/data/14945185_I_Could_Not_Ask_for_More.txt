While McCain is traveling, a number of people are sitting in a park tree. He reaches the tree just as a branch a woman is sitting on breaks and manages to catch her as she falls. ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1999â€“2000) Peak position Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM)Canadian AC peak 1 Canada Top Singles (RPM)Canadian peak 12 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1999) Position Canada Top Singles (RPM) 61 Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) 29 US Adult Contemporary (Billboard) 18 Chart (2000) Position US Adult Contemporary (Billboard) 17 ==Sara Evans cover== American country music singer Sara Evans' cover version of the song was released in February 2001 as the second single from her 2000 album Born to Fly.
