"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" is a song written and recorded by American musician Prince. It was released as the final single from his ninth studio album Sign o' the Times (1987), becoming the third top-ten hit off the album. It has since been covered by numerous artists. ==Content== The song is an upbeat pop number featuring a combination of live drumming with two drum machine patterns. Also featured are two guitar solos, one wild and energetic and one more bluesy and subdued in the full album cut. The song consists of two verses and two choruses, followed by a lengthy instrumental coda. The lyrics paint the image of a woman seeking a man to replace the one who left, while Prince refuses, saying that she would not be satisfied with a one-night stand. The music and accompanying music video pushed this song to the top 10 in the US. The video was taken from the Sign “☮” the Times film, and is a live take of the song and included the horn section of Eric Leeds and Atlanta Bliss. Cash Box called it an "exceptional tune [that] is skillfully produced and performed." The live version of "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" from the video and the Sign “☮” the Times film includes a horn solo in the song's coda. The solo lifts a part of the "Camille" and Black Album track, "Rock Hard in a Funky Place". ==B-side== The single was backed with "Hot Thing", also from Sign “☮” the Times. The 12-inch single includes the full album version of "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man", as well as several remixes of "Hot Thing". One of these was included on the Ultimate compilation album in 2006. "Hot Thing" received enough airplay by DJs to chart on its own, reaching No. 63. ==Track listing== ===7": Paisley Park / 7-28288 (US)=== # "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" (fade) – 3:39 # "Hot Thing" (edit) – 3:40 ===12": Paisley Park / 0-20728 (UK)=== # "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" – 6:31 # "Hot Thing" (edit) – 3:40 # "Hot Thing" (Extended Remix) – 8:32 # "Hot Thing" (Dub Version) – 6:53 === 12": Warner Bros / W8288T (UK) === # "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" – 6:31 # "Hot Thing" (edit) – 3:40 # "Hot Thing" (Extended Remix) – 8:32 *also released as a picture disc (W8288TP) == Personnel == Credits from Duane Tudahl, Benoît Clerc and Guitarcloud * Prince – lead and backing vocals, electric and acoustic guitars, Fairlight CMI, Oberheim OB-8, bass guitar, LinnDrum, handclaps * Susannah Melvoin - possible backing vocals ==Charts== Chart (1987–88) Peak position ==Jordan Knight version== Jordan Knight, of New Kids on the Block, recorded a cover of the song as a ballad for his 1999 self-titled solo debut.
