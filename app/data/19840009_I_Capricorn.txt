I Capricorn is a 1972 album by Shirley Bassey. Following on from the success of her previous two albums, I Capricorn saw Bassey still in the midst of her revival in the 1970s. Some months earlier she had released the single "For All We Know", which had become one of the biggest hits of her career, peaking at No.6 in the UK and remaining on the charts for half a year. This album was released just as the single was leaving the chart and just as her second James Bond theme, "Diamonds are Forever", was entering the chart. Surprisingly, the Bond theme song was not featured on this collection however. The album itself, released in February 1972, made No.13 and remained on the UK album chart for 11 weeks. In the US, Bassey undertook a promotional tour during March which took in 12 cities.I Capricorn CD re-release sleeve notes, David Wells, November 2010 It reached No.94 on the Billboard 200[ US chart position on allmusic] Track "I've Never Been a Woman Before" was subsequently released as a single, but failed to match the success of the first. The B-side, "The Greatest Performance of My Life" (also taken from this album) became a mainstay of her live concerts for the next few years. The album also contained the popular songs "Losing My Mind", "The Look of Love" and John Lennon's "Love". The title track was appropriate in that Bassey was indeed a Capricorn (born January 8). Producer Johnny Harris along with his assistant John Bromley (who also played guitar on the album) penned one song, "The Way a Woman Loves". I Capricorn remains one of the most highly regarded albums by her fans.Album article with reviews Early issues of this album had a metallic gold finish and the artwork was pasted on.
