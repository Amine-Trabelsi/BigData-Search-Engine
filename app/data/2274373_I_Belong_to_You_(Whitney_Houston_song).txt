"I Belong to You" is a 1991 song recorded by American singer Whitney Houston for her third studio album, I'm Your Baby Tonight (1990). It was written by Derek Bramble and Franne Golde, produced by Narada Michael Walden, and was released on October 18, 1991, as the album's fifth single. "I Belong to You" was a Top 10 hit on the US Billboard R&B; chart, and also charted in the UK and the Netherlands. The song garnered Houston a nomination for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance at the 35th Grammy Awards (1993). ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that Houston "delivers a mature and restrained vocal within a lush, urban-angled swing/R&B; arrangement." He noted its "contagious chorus". A reviewer from Music & Media said that "the hip hop-shaped beat is more raw than the melody line, reminiscent of Beats International's 'Dub Be Good to Me'. Vintage Houston." Alan Jones from Music Week viewed it as "a pleasant but unexceptional soul shuffle". James Hunter of Rolling Stone commented that the song "acts out its claim in a penthouse bedroom", and described its production by Narada Michael Walden as "high-end grooves accented by pinballing counterrhythms." ==Music video== The music video for "I Belong to You" features some shots from "My Name Is Not Susan", that are extended and/or unreleased in the video to that song. Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was featured in the video and was also featured in "My Name is Not Susan" as well. The video also includes footage from Houston's I'm Your Baby Tonight World Tour (1991). ==Track listings and formats== * UK 12" vinyl # "I Belong to You" (Shep Pettibone Remix Edit) — 4:32 B # "I Belong to You" (UK Remix Edit) — 4:48 A # "I Belong to You" (Album Version) — 5:28 # "One Moment in Time" — 4:42 * UK CD maxi-single # "I Belong to You" (Album Version Edit) — 4:40 # "I Belong to You" (UK Remix Edit) — 4:49 A # "I Belong to You" (Shep Pettibone Remix Edit) — 4:32 B # "One Moment in Time" — 4:42 A Additional Production and Remix by John Waddell B Additional Production and Remix by Shep Pettibone * US 7" vinyl # "I Belong to You" (Album Version Edit) — 4:41 # "I Belong to You" (International Remix) — 4:52 A * US, UK 12" vinyl # "I Belong to You" (UK Mix) — 8:55 A # "I Belong to You" (UK Dub) — 8:45 A # "I Belong to You" (69th Street Mix) — 9:27 B # "I Belong to You" (69th Street Dub) — 4:16 B ==Charts== Chart (1991–1992) Peak position UK Dance (Music Week) 57 ==Personnel== ;Credits *Lead vocals, backing vocals, vocal arrangement — Whitney Houston *Producer, arranger — Narada Michael Walden *Additional production and remix — John Waddell *Post production and remix — Shep Pettibone *Executive producer — Clive Davis ==References== ==External links== Category:Whitney Houston songs Category:1990 songs Category:Songs written by Franne Golde Category:Song recordings produced by Narada Michael Walden Category:1991 singles Category:Contemporary R&B; ballads Category:Arista Records singles Category:Pop ballads Category:1990s ballads Category:Soul ballads Category:New jack swing songs
