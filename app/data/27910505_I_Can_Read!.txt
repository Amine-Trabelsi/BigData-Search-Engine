I Can Read! is a line of beginning reading books published by HarperCollins. The series is rated by level and is widely used to teach children to read English. The first book in the series was Else Holmelund Minarik's Little Bear, published in 1957, and subsequent notable titles have included Amelia Bedelia and Frog and Toad. ==Structure== The I Can Read! series divides its output into 6 levels *My Very First - For teaching children vowels *My First - For reading aloud to children. *Level 1 - For children who have begun to read sounds and sentences aloud. *Level 2 - For children who can read confidently, but still benefit from help. *Level 3 - Enjoyable titles for children to read unassisted. *Level 4 - Advanced titles to further develop the readers' literacy. ==History== The I Can Read! series began with 1957's Little Bear, by Else Holmelund Minarik and illustrated by Maurice Sendak. In late 2020, HarperCollins announced the addition of a new series called "I Can Read! Comics". It is set to be released in June 2021 with four books, from levels 1 to 3. There are now over 500 titles in the series. ==Other languages and formats== Some I Can Read! books are also available in Spanish, French, audiobook, and e-book format. ==Recognition== I Can Read! books have won Newbery Medal and Caldecott Medal honors. ==Selected titles== * Amelia Bedelia series, Peggy and Herman Parish * At Home in a New Land, Joan Sandin * Biscuit series, Alyssa Satin Capucilli * Danny and the Dinosaur, story and pictures by Syd Hoff (1958) * Frog and Toad series, Arnold Lobel * Little Bear series, by Else Holmelund Minarik, pictures by Maurice Sendak * Two Silly Trolls, Nancy Jewell * The Witch Who Was Afraid of Witches, Alice Low * Indian Summer, by F.N.
