"I Can't Seem to Say Goodbye" is a song written by Don Robertson and originally recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis during his time with Sun Records. The recording didn't see the light of day until 1970, when it was included on the second Jerry Lee Lewis album released by the new owner of Sun Records, Shelby Singleton. (In June 1969, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips sold the entire Sun catalog to Shelby Singleton, which included a treasure trove of unreleased Lewis recordings. With Jerry Lee's rebirth as a country star for Smash Records, Singleton began releasing these older songs and packaged them in such a way that many buyers assumed they were recent recordings.) The song was also released as a single from that album, reaching number 6 on the Cash Box Country Singles chart and number 7 on the Billboard country chart. == Track listing == == Charts == Chart (1970) Peak position US Cash Box Country Singles 6 ==Other versions== Bob Dylan performed a live cover of the song in Nottingham, England on October 28, 2022, the same day that Lewis died. Dylan introduced the song by telling the audience, "I don’t know how many of you know, but Jerry Lee’s gone. We’re gonna play this song, one of his. Jerry Lee will live forever – we all know that". == References == Category:Songs about parting Category:1970 songs Category:1970 singles Category:Jerry Lee Lewis songs Category:Sun Records singles Category:American country music songs
