I Can See Your Voice is a Belgian Dutch-language television mystery music game show series based on the South Korean programme of the same name for the Flemish community. Since its premiere on 26 March 2022, it has aired three seasons on VTM. ==Gameplay== ===Format=== Presented with a group of seven "mystery singers" identified only by their occupation, a guest artist and a group of two contestants must attempt to eliminate bad singers from the group without ever hearing them sing, assisted by clues and a celebrity panel over the course of five rounds. At the end of the game, the last remaining mystery singer is revealed as either good or bad by means of a duet between them and one of the guest artists. ====Rewards==== If the singer is good, the contestants win ; if the singer is bad, the same amount is given to the bad singer instead. ===Rounds=== Each episode presents the guest artist and contestants with seven people whose identities and singing voices are kept concealed until they are eliminated to perform on the "stage of truth" or remain in the end to perform the final duet. _Notes:_ ==Production== DPG Media Belgium formally announced its development of the show in March 2021, as it follows the successful broadcasts of The Masked Singer. It is produced by Warner Bros. International Television Production; the staff team is managed by producers Suzy Fayoumi and Annelies Siebens. Tapings for the programme took place at VTM Studios in Vilvoorde. ==Broadcast history== I Can See Your Voice debuted on 26 March 2022.
