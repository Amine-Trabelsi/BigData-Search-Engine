The Thai television mystery music game show I Can See Your Voice Thailand premiered the fifth season on Workpoint TV on 13 October 2021. With the show celebrating its fifth anniversary, it is dubbed as I Can See Your Voice Festival because of its monicker that applies on a randomly-specific theme, affecting the cast and mystery singers. ==Gameplay== ===Format=== Under the original format, the guest artist can eliminate one or two mystery singers after each round. The game concludes with the last mystery singer standing which depends on the outcome of a duet performance with a guest artist. ===Rounds=== Each episode presents the guest artist with seven people whose identities and singing voices are kept concealed until they are eliminated to perform on the "stage of truth" or remain in the end to perform the final duet. ==Episodes (2021)== ===Guest artists=== Legend: Episode Theme Guest artist Winner 1 13 October 2021 "Pearl of the Orient" rowspan="12" 2 20 October 2021 "Cartoon Heroes" 3 27 October 2021 "Halloween Night" Fon Tanasoontorn 4 3 November 2021 "Wild West" Vasu Sangsingkeo 5 10 November 2021 "Indian Heritage" Kat English 6 17 November 2021 "Ayodhya" Nat Thewphaingam 7 24 November 2021 "Millennium Party" Fourâ€“Mod 8 1 December 2021 "Hollywood Stars" and 9 8 December 2021 "Animal Kingdom" Wichayanee Pearklin 10 15 December 2021 "Varsity Life" Somjit Jongjohor 11 22 December 2021 "Hallyu Wave" 12 29 December 2021 "Workforce" ===Panelists=== Legend: Episode Panelists 1 rowspan="12" rowspan="4" rowspan="2" 2 rowspan="2" 3 rowspan="2" 4 rowspan="4" 5 rowspan="2" 6 7 rowspan="4" rowspan="2" 8 rowspan="2" 9 rowspan="2" rowspan="2" 10 11 12 ==Episodes (2022)== ===Guest artists=== Legend: Episode Theme Guest artist Winner 13 5 January 2022 "New Year's Ball" Best Song Contest's Gentlemen rowspan="4" 14 12 January 2022 "Back to School" 15 19 January 2022 "Space Invaders" Apiwat Eurthavornsuk 16 26 January 2022 "Esan Party" Mum Jokmok Special 2 February 2022 rowspan="2" colspan="3" 9 February 2022 17 16 February 2022 "Valentine's Boys" Oabnithi Wiwattanawarang rowspan="2" 18 23 February 2022 "Valentine's Girls" ===Panelists=== Legend: Episode Panelists 13 rowspan="4" rowspan="2" 14 15 16 17 18 ==Notes== == References == Category:I Can See Your Voice Thailand Category:2021 Thai television seasons Category:2022 Thai television seasons
