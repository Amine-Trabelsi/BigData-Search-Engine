After a bump to the head, Damien passes out. When he wakes up, he finds himself in what seems to be an alternate universe where gender roles are reversed and women have the power. Damien feels confused: now that he experiences sexism he struggles to find his place in this foreign new world. He meets and seduces Alexandra, an influential novelist who is herself a chauvinist. ==Cast== * Vincent Elbaz as Damien * Marie-Sophie Ferdane as Alexandra * Pierre Bénézit as Christophe * Blanche Gardin as Sybille * Céline Menville as Lolo * Christele Tual as Annie * Moon Dailly as Alexandra's coach * Camille Landru-Girardet as Ludovic ==Production== The film finds its origins in Oppressed Majority (), a 2010 short film directed by Pourriat, about a stay-at-home dad who experiences sexism in a parallel, female-dominated world, and eventually becomes the victim of sexual assault. In 2014, after being released on video-sharing platform YouTube with English-language subtitles, the short garnered international attention and Pourriat was approached by Netflix to develop a new, larger project based on the initial premise. Pourriat initially wanted to make a series, but she eventually reached an agreement with Netflix to produce a feature-length romantic comedy with the help of producers Eleonore Dailly and Edouard de Lachomette. The film premiered on Netflix on 13 April 2018. In accordance with French laws on digital film distribution, the film was not scheduled for theatrical release in France, in order to be immediately available online. Pierre Bénézit, the lead actor in Oppressed Majority, played the supporting character Christophe in I Am Not an Easy Man. ==Reception== Étienne Sorin of Le Figaro deplores an "uneven comedy" and conventional.Étienne Sorin.
