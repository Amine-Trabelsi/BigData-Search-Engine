In Modern English, I is the singular, first-person pronoun. == Morphology == In Standard Modern English, _I_ has five distinct word forms: * I: the nominative (subjective) form **I is the only pronoun form that is always capitalized in English. This practice became established in the late 15th century, though lowercase i was sometimes found as late as the 17th century. * me: the accusative (objective) forms (the accusative case is also called the 'oblique'.) * my: the dependent genitive (possessive) form * mine: the independent genitive * myself: the reflexive form ==History== Old English had a first-person pronoun that inflected for four cases and three numbers. I originates from Old English (OE) , which had in turn originated from the continuation of Proto-Germanic *ik, and ek; The asterisk denotes an unattested form, but ek was attested in the Elder Futhark inscriptions (in some cases notably showing the variant eka; see also ek erilaz). Linguists assume ik to have developed from the unstressed variant of ek. Variants of ic were used in various English dialects up until the 1600s. The Proto-Germanic root came, in turn, from the Proto Indo-European language (PIE) *eg-. Old and Middle English first-person pronouns Singular Dual Plural Early OE Late OE ME Early Late ME Early Late ME Nominative Accusative Dative Genitive *Early OE circa , late, and ME Old English and are from Proto-Germanic *meke (accusative) and *mes (dative). Mine is from Proto-Germanic *minaz, and my is a reduced form of mine. All of these are from PIE root *me-. == Syntax == === Functions === I can appear as a subject, object, determiner, or predicative complement. The reflexive form also appears as an adjunct. Me occasionally appears as a modifier in a noun phrase. * Subject: _I_ 'm here; me being here; _my_ being there; I paid for _myself_ to be here. * Object: She saw _me_ ; She introduced him to _me_ ; I saw myself. * Predicative complement: The only person there was _me_ / _I_. * Dependent determiner: I met _my_ friend. * Independent determiner: This is _mine_. * Adjunct: I did it _myself_. * Modifier: the _me_ generation ====Coordinative constructions==== The above applies when the pronoun stands alone as the subject or object. In some varieties of English (particularly in formal registers), those rules also apply in coordinative constructions such as "you and I". * "My husband and I wish you a merry Christmas." * "Between you and me..." In many dialects of informal English, the accusative is sometimes used when the pronoun is part of a coordinative subject construction, as in * "Phil and me wish you a merry Christmas." This is stigmatized but common in many dialects. === Dependents === Pronouns rarely take dependents, but it is possible for me to have many of the same kind of dependents as other noun phrases. * Relative clause modifier: the me _I'd like to be_ ; *me _I'd like to be_ * Determiner: _the_ me I'd like to be; *the me * Adjective phrase modifier: the _real_ me * Adverb phrase external modifier: _Not even_ me == Semantics == I's referents are limited to the individual person speaking or writing, the first person. I is always definite and specific. == Pronunciation == According to the OED, the following pronunciations are used: Form Plain Unstressed Recording I (UK) /ʌɪ/ (US) /aɪ/ female speaker with UK accent me (UK) /miː/ (US) /mi/ /mi/, /mɪ/ /mɪ/ female speaker with US accent my (UK) /mʌɪ/ (US) /maɪ/ female speaker with US accent mine (UK) /mʌɪn/ (US) /maɪn/ female speaker with US accent myself (UK) /mʌɪˈsɛlf/ (US) /maɪˈsɛlf/ /mᵻˈsɛlf/ /məˈsɛlf/ female speaker with US accent ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * "Etymology of I".
