"I Ain't Never" is a song co-written by American country music artists Webb Pierce and Mel Tillis. Each co-writer recorded the song separately, with both Pierce's (1959), and years later Tillis's (1972), versions resulting in major hits. ==Background== According to Tillis, he wrote the song himself, and agreed to credit Pierce as a co-writer in exchange for a pair of boots Pierce was wearing when Tillis pitched him the song. In Tillis's words, "Them old boots cost me over eight hundred thousand dollars" in royalties.Ralph Emery's Country Legends Volume 2 DVD It Is Rumored, this song was originally written by Jerry Leen Richards, and Webb stole the song for himself. ==Chart performance== Pierce's version was released in 1959, eventually spending nine weeks at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot C&W; Sides chart that year (held out by "The Three Bells (Les Trois Cloches)" by The Browns).
