The game concludes with the last mystery singer standing which depends on the outcome of a duet performance with a guest artist. ===Rounds=== Each episode presents the guest artist with seven people whose identities and singing voices are kept concealed until they are eliminated to perform on the "stage of truth" or remain in the end to perform the final duet. ==Episodes (2016)== ===Guest artists=== Legend: Episode Guest artist Winner 1 13 January 2016 Saranyu Winaipanit 2 20 January 2016 3 27 January 2016 rowspan="2" 4 3 February 2016 5 10 February 2016 rowspan="2" 6 17 February 2016 7 24 February 2016 Sarunrat Visutthithada rowspan="2" 8 2 March 2016 Saksit Vejsupaporn 9 9 March 2016 Apiwat Eurthavornsuk 10 16 March 2016 11 23 March 2016 Chinawut Indracusin 12 30 March 2016 rowspan="2" 13 6 April 2016 14 13 April 2016 rowspan="2" 15 20 April 2016 16 27 April 2016 Palitchoke Ayanaputra 17 4 May 2016 Jintara Poonlarp 18 11 May 2016 19 18 May 2016 rowspan="10" 20 25 May 2016 21 1 June 2016 22 8 June 2016 23 15 June 2016 24 22 June 2016 25 29 June 2016 Saharat Sangkapreecha 26 6 July 2016 27 13 July 2016 Jack 28 20 July 2016 Thierry Mekwattana 29 27 July 2016 rowspan="3" 30 3 August 2016 Saranyu Winaipanit 31 10 August 2016 Kornpob Janjarearn 32 17 August 2016 Saksit Vejsupaporn 33 24 August 2016 Jirakorn Sompitak rowspan="2" 34 31 August 2016 Theng Therdtherng 35 7 September 2016 rowspan="5" 36 14 September 2016 37 21 September 2016 Rannaphan Yungyuenpoonchai 38 28 September 2016 Win Siriwong 39 5 October 2016 40 12 October 2016 Special 16 November 2016 colspan="2" 41 23 November 2016 42 30 November 2016 Krissada Sukosol Clapp rowspan="4" 43 7 December 2016 44 14 December 2016 45 21 December 2016 Special 28 December 2016 colspan="2" ===Panelists=== Legend: Episode Panelists 1 rowspan="17" rowspan="6" rowspan="2" 2 3 4 rowspan="2" 5 6 rowspan="5" 7 8 rowspan="28" 9 10 11 rowspan="2" 12 rowspan="6" 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 rowspan="13" rowspan="9" 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 rowspan="3" 28 29 30 31 32 33 rowspan="13" rowspan="2" 34 35 rowspan="3" 36 37 rowspan="4" rowspan="2" 38 39 rowspan="7" 40 41 42 rowspan="4" 43 44 45 ==Episodes (2017)== ===Guest artists=== Legend: Episode Guest artist Winner 46 4 January 2017 Patiparn Pataweekarn rowspan="4" 47 11 January 2017 48 18 January 2017 Thaitanium 49 25 January 2017 Kat English 50 1 February 2017 51 8 February 2017 Sunaree Ratchasima rowspan="5" 52 15 February 2017 53 22 February 2017 54 1 March 2017 55 8 March 2017 Dax 56 15 March 2017 Nicole Theriault 57 22 March 2017 Thanakrit Panichwid rowspan="14" 58 29 March 2017 59 5 April 2017 60 12 April 2017 61 19 April 2017 62 26 April 2017 63 3 May 2017 Rhatha Phongam 64 10 May 2017 Issara Kitnitchi 65 17 May 2017 66 24 May 2017 Slot Machine 67 31 May 2017 68 7 June 2017 Fon Tanasoontorn 69 14 June 2017 Tik Shiro 70 21 June 2017 71 28 June 2017 Seksan Sukpimai 72 5 July 2017 Chaiya Mitchai 73 12 July 2017 Touch Na Takuatung rowspan="2" 74 19 July 2017 Mai Charoenpura 75 26 July 2017 rowspan="3" 76 2 August 2017 Wichayanee Pearklin 77 9 August 2017 ===Panelists=== Legend: Episode Panelists 46 rowspan="29" rowspan="25" rowspan="2" 47 48 49 rowspan="2" 50 51 52 53 54 rowspan="9" 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 rowspan="4" 62 63 64 65 rowspan="2" 66 rowspan="2" 67 68 69 70 rowspan="8" rowspan="2" 71 72 73 rowspan="3" 74 75 rowspan="2" 76 rowspan="2" rowspan="2" 77 ==Notes== == References == Category:I Can See Your Voice Thailand Category:2016 Thai television seasons Category:2017 Thai television seasons
