As the programme is aimed at children, the dishes are simple to prepare. Some dishes, such as the grape pizza, offer alternatives to traditional dishes. As well as encouraging children to cook, the show encompasses wider elements of food education; it uses cutaway scenes to show Ashworth in outside locations, explaining the process of cultivating, and growing any key ingredient in the show's dish. ==I Can Cook With You== During 2011, the series was branded I Can Cook With You, and featured Katy travelling around the United Kingdom in her own van, to cook in various outdoor locations, and visiting farms and other locations, where food is produced. ==I Can Cook on the Go== In 2012, the series was branded I Can Cook on the Go, and features a new revamped van called Horace, and “pinchy parrot”, and wooden spoon puppets.
