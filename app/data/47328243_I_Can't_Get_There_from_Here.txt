"I Can't Get There from Here" is a song by American country singer George Jones. It was released as a single on the Musicor label in 1967. It was composed by Dallas Frazier. Although he didn't write it, "I Can't Get There from Here" is one in a long list of songs that Jones would record as if it was torn from the pages of his diary; as Randy Travis stated in the 1990 Jones video biography Same Ole Me, "It's almost like he's lived every minute of every word he sings, and there's very few people who can do that." Jones, who would be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his binge drinking in 1967, had already gained a reputation as a notorious hell raiser, imbuing Frazier's words with a weary authenticity: ::Surely there's a place to rest a tortured mind ::Oh, what I'd give if I could find ::A place where there's no mem'ry of all those wasted years ::But they all say I can't get there from here The song reached No. 5 on the Billboard country singles chart. ==Discography== Category:1966 songs Category:Songs written by Dallas Frazier Category:Song recordings produced by Pappy Daily Category:George Jones songs
