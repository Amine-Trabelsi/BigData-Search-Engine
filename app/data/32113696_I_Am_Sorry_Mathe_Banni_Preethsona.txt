Its Sanjanas performance as a sex worker that adds drama to the story. Anoop Seelin's foot-tapping tunes will impress the youth. Ashok Kashyap's cinematography is commendable". Shruti Indira Lakshminarayana from Rediff.com scored the film at 2.5 out of 5 stars and says "Gurprasad's dialogues -- romantic, philosophical and comic -- will draw whistles. Anup Silin's songs are a definite advantage. Ashok Kashyap handle's the camera well. If you are a Prem fan and are bored of the run of the mill romantic stories, go find out for yourself". A critic from The New Indian Express wrote "His dialogues are meaningful. Cinematographer Ashok Kashyap has done a neat job behind the camera. Anup Seelin has composed foot-tapping tunes. Songs are good, especially the song —‘Joojuba Joojuba’ — is hummable. The movie is worth watching for all, especially husbands who suspect their sincere and loving wives". B S Srivani from Deccan Herald wrote "Camerawork too measures up to expectations. But for a climax that drags and cheap gimmicks prior to the release, Matthe Banni Prithsona is quite an interesting offering". A critic from News18 India wrote "Anoop Sileen has given different tunes for all the five songs of the film. Ashok Kashyap is as usual exceptional behind the camera. 'I'm Sorry Mathe Banni Preethsona' is a must watch". ===Awards=== * Karnataka State Film Award for Best Screenplay - Ravindra H.
