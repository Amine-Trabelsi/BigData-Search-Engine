By framing her father so that he is facing prison, James forces Julia to marry him to save her father. James’ brother Robert (Faust) falls in love with Julia and his attentions become obnoxious. Julia never becomes reconciled to her husband, and Robert finally instills into James’ mind the thought that she still loves Harrington. Through a ruse, James comes on a party which includes Robert, and Corinne (le Breton), a chorus girl, finds Robert making love to Julia and shoots him. Corinne is found with the revolver in her hand, and tried for the murder. During the trial James discovers Corinne is actually his own daughter, and persuades the judge to postpone the trial for one day. That night he sends for Harrington, the district attorney, and Corinne. James then takes poison and dies leaving a confession which reads: “I am the man.” Julia finds happiness with Harrington and Corinne marries her sweetheart Billy. ==Cast== ==Preservation== With no prints of I Am the Man located in any film archives,Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Database: I Am the Man it is a lost film. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Munden, Kenneth White.
