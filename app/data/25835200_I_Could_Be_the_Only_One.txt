Kevin described "The Only One" as "arguably my favorite", saying that "It's definitely one of the coolest...The charge of it, the way it explodes out at you. The lyric, the circularity of the bridge, the way the phrases fold over each other." Andy Hull described "I Could Be With Anyone" as "...an incredibly real and painfully-depressing song. I've loved this tune since the moment I heard it."Manchester Orchestra & Kevin Devine, 'I Could Be the Only One' (Two-Song Bundle) -- Song Premiere The single was originally planned as a 7" vinyl, but has been indefinitely delayed. ==Track listing== ==References== Category:Manchester Orchestra albums Category:Kevin Devine EPs Category:2010 EPs Category:Split EPs
