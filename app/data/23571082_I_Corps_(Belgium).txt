The 1st Corps of the Belgian Army (), was a Belgian army corps active during First World War, Second World War, and the Cold War. ==World War II== During the Belgian Campaign of 1940, it initially held defences at Liège but was forced to retreat by the German XVI Panzer Corps. The Battle of Fort Eben- Emael occurred along the Corps' defensive line. German planners had recognised the need to eliminate Fort Eben-Emael if their army was to break into the interior of Belgium. It decided to deploy airborne forces (Fallschirmjäger) to land inside the fortress perimeter using gliders. Using special explosives and flamethrowers to disable the defences, the Fallschirmjäger then entered the fortress. In the course of the battle, German infantry overcame the defenders of the I Belgian Corps' 7th Infantry Division in 24 hours. ==Post-war service== thumb|Belgian barracks "Quartier Haelen" at Köln-Junkersdorf, Germany During the Cold War, it served initially as an army of occupation in Germany and then as part of NATO's Northern Army Group (NORTHAG).
