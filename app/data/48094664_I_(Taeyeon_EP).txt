I is the debut extended play by South Korean singer Taeyeon, released on October 7, 2015, by SM Entertainment. The EP was recorded at SM Studios in Seoul, South Korea, and was produced by Lee Soo-man. ==Background and release== In mid-2015, SM Entertainment announced that Taeyeon would release her first solo album later that year. The album's title track, "I", features popular rapper Verbal Jint and includes lyrics written by Taeyeon. The album was released via digital music websites at midnight on October 7, the physical copies sold in the stores on same day. Due to her previous success recording ballads for Korean films and televisions, the public expected Taeyeon to promote the album with a ballad title track. The singer, however, chose a pop rock song and expressed that she wanted to "make [her] solo debut with good songs regardless of their genres." Discussing about her music styles for the album, Taeyeon noted that she purposely avoided "way over the top" songs, elaborating: > I tried not to be excessive. I tried to sing in more plain and light ways. I > have to sing from the beginning to the end all by myself, so I should feel > comfortable. So I didn't choose such reckless songs [flowery or high- > pitched], and tried to avoid challenging, something too new. == Music and lyrics == Lee Su-ho from South Korean online magazine IZM described I as a pop rock album with a balladic production. Meanwhile, Chester Chin from Malaysian newspaper The Star noted elements of soft rock on the EP, a genre that is contrary to Girls' Generation's common bubblegum pop and electronic sound. ==Reception== Upon its release, I received generally positive reviews from music critics. Lee Su-ho from South Korean online magazine IZM praised the EP's pop rock and balladic musical styles; they further hailed I for showcasing Taeyeon as a talented vocalist. Chester Chin from The Star labelled the album as "a collection of dynamic K-pop confections" with "refreshing" elements of soft rock as opposed to Girls' Generation's signature bubblegum and electronic sound. He further deemed it as "a reflection of Taeyeon’s strength as a vocalist." I was a commercial success in the singer's native country South Korea.
