It charted for twenty weeks and went to Number One on the chart dated April 22, 1995, and stayed there for one week before being replaced by Brooks & Dunn's "Little Miss Honky Tonk" the next week.

It was produced by David Foster, selling 600,000 copies domestically and being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Despite a live performance on the BBC's long- running music programme Top of the Pops, it only peaked at number 33 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's last top-40 entry there. ===Critical reception=== Steve Baltin from Cash Box wrote, "All-4-One had one of the biggest hits of last year with the chart-topping "I Swear". The first single from their forthcoming And The Music Speaks album continues the remarkably middle-of-the-road sound they put forth last year. As a result, similar chart success is likely. Though appeal of the same magnitude might be harder to achieve. Simple and Wonder Bread white, “I Can Love You Like That” is a huge ballad." ===Track listing=== * CD single – Europe (1995) # "I Can Love You Like That" (edit) – 3:51 # "All-4-1" – 5:24 # "I Can Love You Like That" (LP version) – 4:23 ===Charts=== ====Weekly charts==== Chart (1995–1996) Peak position Europe (European Dance Radio) 14 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 Tipparade) 16 Zimbabwe (ZIMA)* Zimbabwe.
