I („ÅÑ in hiragana or „Ç§ in katakana) is one of the Japanese kana each of which represents one mora. „ÅÑ is based on the s≈çsho style of the kanji character ‰ª•, and „Ç§ is from the radical (left part) of the kanji character ‰ºä. In the modern Japanese system of sound order, it occupies the second position of the syllable chart, between „ÅÇ and „ÅÜ. Additionally, it is the first letter in Iroha, before „Çç. Both represent the sound . In the Ainu language, katakana „Ç§ is written as y in their Latin-based syllable chart, and a small „Ç£ after another katakana represents a diphthong.
