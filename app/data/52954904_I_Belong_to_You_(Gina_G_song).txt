"I Belong to You" is a song recorded by Australian singer-songwriter Gina G from her debut album, Fresh! (1997). The single was released on 28 October 1996 by Eternal as the follow-up to Gina's highly successful "Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit" and was her first release to be produced by Metro, who would produce the majority of her singles. Written by her with Bill Colbourne, it spent two weeks in the UK top 10, peaking at number six and spending a further 9 weeks in the top 75 (and a further 9 weeks in the top 200). The single also was a top 20 hit in Denmark, Finland, Ireland and Mexico. Its music video, directed by Max Giwa and Dania Pasquini, featured Gina G as a genie in a lamp. She performed "I Belong to You" in various TV-shows, like Top of the Pops and WOW!. ==Critical reception== British magazine Music Week gave "I Belong to You" four out of five, complimenting it as "hugely catchy dance pop." The reviewer added, "It is unlikely to get as much exposure as her Eurovision contender, but deserves to be a smash." In an retrospective review, Pop Rescue stated that the song followed "Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit" "perfectly as it is fairly similar in sound", noting that it "really gallops along, with a chugging fat synth line as Gina's vocals sit flawlessly on top. This is a lovely dance pop song." A reviewer from Sunday Mirror described it as "high energy".Sunday Mirror. 9 March 1997. p. 33. ==Chart performance== "I Belong to You" proved to be a major hit on several continents.
