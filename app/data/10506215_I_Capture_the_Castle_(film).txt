Romola Garai played the lead role of Cassandra Mortmain alongside Bill Nighy, Rose Byrne and Tara Fitzgerald. ==Synopsis== The film follows 17-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, and her eccentric family, struggling to survive in genteel poverty in a decaying English castle. The characters include her father, a writer who hasn't written anything in the 12 years since the spectacular success of his first novel; her older sister Rose, who rails against their fate and hopes to marry for money; and their bohemian stepmother, Topaz, an ex-model still apt to sun-bathe in the nude. The possibility of salvation seems to loom in the form of their wealthy American landlord Simon Cotton and his brother Neil. Although Simon initially spurns her, Rose is determined to make him fall in love with her and succeeds. A wedding is arranged and Cassandra appears to be left on the sidelines. Cassandra is confused not only by her feelings for the Cottons but also for Stephen Colley. Stephen is the incredibly attractive son of the Mortmains' former chef who acts as a handyman to the family and is deeply in love with Cassandra. But events spiral out of control, and before the summer ends many expectations will have been overturned. ==Production== Parts of the film were shot in Laxey film studio on the Isle of Man. Manorbier Castle in Pembrokeshire, Wales, supplied exteriors for the castle, and Eltham Palace in London some interiors. ==Main cast== == Reception == On the basis of 81 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 80% of critics gave I Capture the Castle a positive review, with an average rating of 6.7/10. == References == == External links == * * * Category:2003 films Category:2003 romantic comedy films Category:BBC Film films Category:British romantic comedy films Category:2003 directorial debut films Category:Films about families Category:Films about writers Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films directed by Tim Fywell Category:Films produced by David Parfitt Category:Films scored by Dario Marianelli Category:Films set in the 1930s Category:Films set in castles Category:Films set in England Category:Films shot in the Isle of Man Category:Films shot in London Category:Films shot in Pembrokeshire Category:Films based on works by Dodie Smith Category:Films about sisters Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s British films
