"I Believe You" is a love ballad composed by Don and Dick Addrisi which was a 1977 single for Dorothy Moore; taken from her self-titled Dorothy Moore album. "I Believe You" reached #5 R&B; and crossed over to the US Pop Top 30 at number 27.Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–1990 - The track also reached number 20 in the UK. ==Carpenters cover== The song was recorded by the Carpenters and released as a single in June 1978. While it reached number 9 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, it peaked at a disappointing #68 on the Billboard Hot 100, owing significantly to the fact that its accompanying album was delayed indefinitely (it would be three more years until their next album was released), reportedly due to Karen's health issues, although Richard at the time was also dealing with his own addiction to quaaludes. In June 1981 the album Made in America—which included "I Believe You"—was finally released. The potential success "I Believe You" might have had it been issued in conjunction with an LP was underscored when the album's eventual lead single, "Touch Me When We're Dancing", became the first Carpenters hit to reach the Hot 100's Top 20 as well as number 1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart since "There's a Kind of Hush" did the same in early 1976. ==Personnel== *Karen Carpenter – lead and backing vocals *Richard Carpenter – backing vocals, piano, Fender Rhodes electric piano, celesta, vocal arrangements *Joe Osborn – bass *Larrie Londin – drums *Tim May – acoustic and electric guitars *Jerry Steinholtz – congas *Uncredited - bell tree, flute, oboe, shaker, triangle *Paul Riser - orchestration ==Chart history== ;Dorothy Moore Chart (1977) Peak position Canada RPM Top Singles 29 Canada RPM Adult Contemporary 13 UK (OCC) 20 US Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–1990 - 27 US Billboard R&B; 5 US Billboard Adult Contemporary 24 US Cash Box Top 100 Cash Box Top 100 Singles, October 22, 1977 28 ;The Carpenters Chart (1978) Peak position Canadian RPM Top Singles 81 Canada RPM Adult Contemporary 22 US Billboard Hot 100 68 US Billboard Adult Contemporary 9 ==Other cover versions== *"I Believe You" was also featured on the 1978 album Moods by Barbara Mandrell. ==References== Category:1977 songs Category:1977 singles Category:1978 singles Category:Dorothy Moore songs Category:The Carpenters songs Category:Malaco Records singles Category:A&M; Records singles
