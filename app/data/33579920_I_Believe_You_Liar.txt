I Believe You Liar is the debut studio album by Australian singer-songwriter Washington. It was released on Mercury Records in Australia on 30 July 2010. The album peaked at number 3 on the ARIA Charts charts. At the J Awards of 2010, the album was nominated for Australian Album of the Year. == Background == I Believe You Liar is largely composed of tracks from Washington's previous three EP releases, Clementine (2008), How to Tame Lions (2009), and Rich Kids (2010). Out of the twelve tracks on the original Australian edition, five were included previously on these releases. Although the album somewhat lacked new material, it was a commercial success in Washington's native Australia, peaking at number 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart. A special edition of the album was released simultaneously, including a bonus CD which included all other tracks from Washington's previous three EPs.Washington - I Believe You Liar (2Ã—CD) - Discogs In October 2011, the album was released internationally in the UK and US with new cover artwork, and a revised track listing omitting "Clementine" and including two new tracks from Washington's then-upcoming EP Insomnia, which was released exclusively in Australia two weeks later.
