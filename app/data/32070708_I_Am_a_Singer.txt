I Am a Singer () is a popular South Korean singing competition program; a part of MBC's Sunday Night lineup. Seven talented, veteran Korean singers perform for a selected audience, which votes to eliminate one singer after each week's performance. The following week, another singer joins the competition, and the lineup of artists varies throughout the course of the show.Description of Program, MBC, Retrieved on November 15, 2011 The program ended its first season on February 19, 2012. Its second season ended in May 2012. Its third season ended on April 24, 2015. I Am a Singer differs from other televised music competitions in that the participants are all veteran musicians who have established music careers varying from mega stardom to relative obscurity. Due to this fact, and because none of the accomplished singers desire to be voted last amongst their peers and eliminated, the level of performance is usually high and acclaimed by critics and viewers alike. == Composition == The show is divided into rounds. Each round consists of two performance episodes, one that is preliminary and the second final performance which determines the lowest ranking contestant to be eliminated. In between performance are also separate intermediate episodes that document the singers' progress and rehearsals. Contestants are popular and prominent artists from various genres of the Korean music industry. Each contestant is paired with a "manager", seven Korean entertainers and comedians who serve as mentors, accompany their singers throughout the week to provide support during rehearsals and provide comic relief to the show. The competition is documented by the week. At the beginning of the 1st performance week, each contestant selects a song of their choice. All contestants spend the week practicing and planning, given free rein on the interpretation of their songs and the staging of their performances. After the performance, votes from the 500-member studio audience determine the singers' rankings, although there is no elimination. For the 2nd performance week, the singers gather and are assigned predetermined songs that fit their vocal range and style, and the rest of the week is spent in rehearsals and consulting with other musicians. These intermediate episodes include sample performances in the middle of the week, allowing the contestants to exhibit their progress in front of fellow competitors. The competitors privately vote for 1st and 7th place, determining the singers' rankings to serve as a checkpoint. Final performances are given, again, in front of a live audience. At the end of the performances, the audience casts votes for three favorites. The results are revealed sans audience to the contestants and managers, ranking competitors from first to seventh. The competitor with the lowest average ranking is eliminated, and the next week sees a new singer added to the competition. Starting from Round 1, the average of both performance scores is taken and the contestant with the lowest total of votes is eliminated, as new contestant replace him/her. Singers who survive 7 times in a row graduate from the program. == Competition Results == *P = Pass, E = Eliminated, G = Graduated, L = Voluntarily Left, R = Re-challenge Singer Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Number of Times Passed Singer 3/20 (R1) 3/27 (R2) 5/22 (1R) 6/12 (2R) 7/3 (3R) 7/24 (4R) 8/14 (5R) 9/11 (6R) 10/2 (7R) 10/23 (8R) 11/20 (9R) 12/11 (10R) 1/01 (11R) 1/22 (12R) 2/12 (13R) Number of Times Passed Park Jung-hyun P P P P P P G 7 Kim Bum-soo P P P P P P G 7 Yoon Do-hyun P P P P P P E 6 Lee So-ra P P P E 3 Baek Ji-young P L 2 Kim Gun-mo R L 1 Jung Yeob P E 1 YIm Jae-bum L 1 Kim Yeon-woo E 0 BMK P P E 2 Ock Joo-hyun P P E 2 JK Kim Dong-wook L 1 Jang Hye-jin P P P P P P E 6 Jo Kwan-woo P P P P E 4 Kim Jo-han P P E 2 Jaurim P P P P P P G 7 Bobby Kim P P P P P E 5 Yoon Min-soo P P P P P P G 7 Insooni P P P P E 4 Kim Kyung-ho P P P P P P G 7 Jo Kyu-chan E 0 Gummy P P P P P 4 Juckwoo P P P P 4 Park Wan-kyu P P P 3 Tei E 0 Lee Young-hyun P 1 Lee Hyun-woo P 1 == List of episodes in Season 1 == === Episodes 1-3: Pilot === Episode 1 - 1st Performance *Broadcast: March 6, 2011 Order of Performance Singer Song Title Comedian Manager Ranking 1 Lee So-ra 바람이 분다(The Wind is Blowing) Lee Byung-jin 6 2 Jeong Yeob Nothing Better Kim Shin-young 7 3 Baek Ji-young 총 맞은 것 처럼(Like Being Shot by a bullet) Park Hwi-soon 5 4 Kim Bum-soo 보고 싶다(I Miss You) Park Myung-su 2 5 Yoon Do-hyun 빨간 숲 속(It Burns) Kim Je-dong 4 6 Park Jung-hyun 꿈에(In Dream) Kim Tae-hyun 1 7 Kim Gun-mo 잠 못 드는 밤 비는 내리고(Sleepless Rainy Night) Ji Sang-ryul 3 Episode 2 - Interim Check *Broadcast: March 13, 2011 Interim Ranking Singer Song Title Comedian Manager 1 Jung Yeob 짝사랑 (Ju Hyun-mi) Kim Shin-young 2 Baek Ji-young 무시로 (Na Hoon-ah) Park Hwi-soon 3 Kim Bum-soo 그대 모습은 장미 (Min Hye-kyung) Park Myung-su 4 Park Jung-hyun 비오는 날의 수채화 (Kim Hyun-shik, Kang In-won, Kwon In-ha) Kim Tae-hyun 5 Lee So-ra 너에게로 또다시 (Byun Jin-seob) Lee Byung-jin 6 Yoon Do-hyun 나 항상 그대를 (Lee Sun-hee) Kim Je-dong 7 Kim Gun-mo 립스틱 짙게 바르고 (Im Ju-ri) Ji Sang- ryul Episode 3 - 2nd Performance *Broadcast: March 20, 2011 Order of Performance Singer Song Title Original Singer Comedian Manager Ranking 1 Yoon Do-hyun 나 항상 그대를(I Always Miss You) Lee Sun-hee Kim Je-dong 1(23%) 2 Baek Ji- young 무시로(At Any Time) Na Hoon-ah Park Hwi-soon Private 3 Park Jung-hyun 비오는 날의 수채화(Watercolor of a Rainy day) Kim Hyun-shik, Kang In-won, Kwon In-ha Kim Tae-hyun Private 4 Kim Bum-soo 그대 모습은 장미(Roses Likes You) Min Hye-kyung Park Myung-su Private 5 Kim Gun-mo 립스틱 짙게 바르고(Wearing Lipstick Heavily) Im Ju-ri Ji Sang-ryul 7 6 Lee So-ra 너에게로 또다시(To You Again) Byun Jin-sub Lee Byung-jin Private 7 Jung Yeob 짝사랑(unrequited love) Ju Hyun-mi Kim Shin-young private *Eliminated: Kim Gun-mo === Episode 4: Controversy === *Broadcast: March 27, 2011 Kim Gun-mo was eliminated on Episode 3, but the singers all felt that it was too early to be eliminated so he was brought back to try again.
