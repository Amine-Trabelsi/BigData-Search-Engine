I Am... is a female-led drama anthology series of standalone stories created by Dominic Savage for Channel 4. Each episode is developed and written by Dominic Savage in collaboration with the leading actress. ==Background== Created, written and directed by filmmaker Dominic Savage, each episode of I Am... centres on a titular character which the episode is named after. Each standalone story was developed in a creative partnership with the leading actor, with improvised dialogue and themes including relationships, mental health, and empowerment. Filming for the first series took place in 29 days, effectively 10 days per episode. According to I Am...s producer Krishnendu Majumdar, the filmmakers wanted an intimate but cinematic look for the episodes. Majumdar said the whole series was shot hand-held "as though we are eavesdropping on the characters", in order to add to the documentary feel of the drama. ==Episodes== ===Series 1=== ===Series 2=== ===Series 3=== ==Accolades== Year Award Category Nominee(s) Result Royal Television Society Craft & Design Awards Photography - Drama & Comedy Stuart Bentley British Academy Television Awards Best Actress Samantha Morton British Academy Television Awards Best Single Drama Dominic Savage, Krishnendu Majumdar, Richard Yee, Suranne Jones, Josh Hyams, David Charap Royal Television Society Programme Awards Leading Actor: Female Kate Winslet British Academy Television Awards Best Single Drama Dominic Savage, Krishnendu Majumdar, Josh Hyams, Kate Winslet, Richard Yee, David Charap Best Actress Kate Winslet British Academy Television Craft Awards Best Photography & Lighting: Fiction Rachel Clark ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 British television series debuts Category:2010s British anthology television series Category:2010s British drama television series Category:2020s British anthology television series Category:2020s British drama television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Channel 4 original programming Category:BAFTA winners (television series)
