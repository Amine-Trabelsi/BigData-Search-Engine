I Ain't Movin is the second studio album by British soul singer-songwriter Des'ree. It was released on 9 May 1994 in the UK, and 5 July 1994 in the US on Epic Records, and features the top 5 smash hit, "You Gotta Be". ==Critical reception== Tom Demalon of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing that "Des'ree possesses a pleasing vocal delivery, and it serves her well on songs like the slinky, mid-tempo 'Feel So High,' the breezy 'Little Child,' the hypnotic groove of 'Trip on Love' and the confessional title cut." ==Singles== Three singles were released from I Ain't Movin: "You Gotta Be", "I Ain't Movin'" and "Little Child". In the US, "Feel So High" was featured on and released as a single from I Ain't Movin' rather than from Des'ree's debut album Mind Adventures. The song was added to the re-issue of the UK edition of the album, which was released in 2000. "You Gotta Be" was also remixed and re- released in the UK in 1995. The "Kissing You" single was included as a bonus CD with the Australian reissue of the album in 1997. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the album's liner notes. ===Production=== *Produced by Des'ree, Ashley Ingram, Phil Legg, Peter Lord Moreland, V.
