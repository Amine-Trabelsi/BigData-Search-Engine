It was also featured in the video game Saints Row. ==Background== Eric B and Rakim met in 1985, after Rakim responded to Eric B's search for "New York's top MC". In 1986 they released their debut single, "Eric B. Is President", on an independent label Zakia Records. Def Jam Recordings co-founder Russell Simmons found out about the duo and they were signed to Island Records. In early 1987 the duo started working on Paid in Full. ==Recording== According to Rakim, the duo spent a week working on Paid in Full, with "I Ain't No Joke" taking most of it, four days. In an interview with Spin magazine Rakim said that while writing the song he deliberately avoided using obscene language: "I Ain't No Joke" was produced by the duo using the samples from "Pass the Peas" by The J.B.'s and "Theme from the Planets" by Dexter Wansel. Like most of the album, "I Ain't No Joke" was recorded at Power Play Studios in Long Island City, Queens, New York City. ==Music video== Music video for "I Ain't No Joke" was directed by Vivien Goldman, a British journalist, writer, and musician, who also had experience in guerrilla filmmaking. The budget available to them was low, so she asked Eric B. and Rakim where they like to hang out, and chose it as the locations for the music video. The video features Rakim rapping in three different locations: in front of a graffiti mural, on a playground with his friends, and outside of an electronics shop in Harlem, in front of a crowd, with Eric B. playing on turntables. The shots of these locations change constantly throughout the video. Both Eric B. and Rakim wear golden age era outfits, consisting of tracksuits and heavy gold chains and jewelry, and described by Complex magazine as "flamboyant" and "both classic and priceless". The video also features a cameo appearance from Flavor Flav of the group Public Enemy, and a cameo of "Chill Will", a DJ from the trio Doug E. Fresh and The Get Fresh Crew, dancing on the playground and in front of the crowd near the store. ==Track listing== ;Side A # "I Ain't No Joke" – 3:54 # "Extended Beat" – 3:49 ;Side B # "Eric B.
