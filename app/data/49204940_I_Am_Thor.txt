I Am Thor is a documentary about the life of bodybuilder and rock musician Jon Mikl Thor of the band Thor. The film was directed by Ryan Wise and produced by Ryan Wise and Alan Higbee and had its world premiere at the 2015 Slamdance Film Festival. == Plot == I am Thor is the story of Jon Mikl Thor, a bodybuilding, steel bending, brick smashing rock star in the 1970s and 1980s whose theatrical band Thor hit the scene alongside Metallica and Kiss, but never achieved the gold record status of its contemporaries. After a brief but memorable film career saw him starring in the cult classics Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare and Zombie Nightmare, Thor all but disappeared from the entertainment map. But ten years into retirement, and incapable of living like a normal mortal human being, Thor attempts a comeback to achieve the level of success that had eluded him his entire career â€“ a comeback that nearly kills him. Tracing the rise, fall, and rebirth of a determined performer over the course of a career that has seen more than its fair share of highs and lows, I AM THOR paints a fascinating and sometimes unbelievable portrait of this larger-than-life icon. == Release == After premiering at the Slamdance Film Festival in January 2015 the film then went on to screen at film festivals including Florida Film Festival, Calgary Underground FIlm Festival, Brooklyn Film Festival, New Zealand International Film Festival, and the Fantasia International Film Festival where it won the Audience Award for Best Documentary.
