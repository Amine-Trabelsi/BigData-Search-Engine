Frank having saved his life during the war, John believes in him so much that both he and wife Ruth provide the defendant with an alibi, resulting in his acquittal. Frank later confesses to John how he did indeed commit the crime, aided by Joe Corsi and other accomplices. John expresses regret for his actions and leaves Ruth, wanting to be alone for a while. He is actually busy scheming to frame Corsi for the murder. Corsi tries to avoid a conviction by accusing Bricolle in the courtroom, where Bricolle pulls a gun and tries to shoot his way out. He is killed, and John returns home to Ruth. == Cast == *Tom Conway as John Campbell *Steve Brodie as Frank Bricolle *Robert Osterloh as Joe Corsi *Barbara Billingsley as Ruth Campbell *Russell Hicks as District Attorney Randolph *James Seay as Rodd Simpson *Chet Huntley as Himself *Tommy Noonan as Sad Sam Carney *William Gould as First Judge *Harry Harvey, Sr. as Second Judge *Garry Owen as Jerry *Charles Wagenheim as Al Markham == References == == External links == * Category:1949 films Category:1940s English-language films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American crime films Category:1949 crime films Category:Films directed by Edward L.
