10034391	I Accuse My Parents	I Accuse My Parents is a 1944 American exploitation film dealing with juvenile delinquency. Produced by PRC, the film was used to teach morals, specifically that parents should take an interest in their children's lives, as well as the consequences (both emotionally and psychologically) of child neglect. It premiered on November 4, 1944 and was released generally on October 27, 1945. ==Plot== Mild-mannered teen James "Jimmy" Wilson (Robert Lowell) appears before a judge on charges of manslaughter. When asked to speak in his own defense, he pauses, and reflects to say; "I accuse my parents" for not giving him the home life he should have had. The film then flashes back to a day in high school, when Jim was given an award for an essay describing the ideal home he supposedly has. Eager to tell his parents, he goes home to a house full of empty liquor bottles, and parents distracted by arguing with each other. Jimmy is embarrassed when his mother (Vivienne Osbourne) shows up drunk to the graduation planning committee. Later, his father (John Miljan) gives him money instead of celebrating his birthday with him. Jim gets a job selling shoes after school and meets torch singer Kitty Reed (Mary Beth Hughes). He delivers a pair of shoes to her house and then meets her later at the nightclub where she works. The two begin dating, Jim unaware that Kitty is also the moll of gangster Charles Blake (George Meeker), who specializes in fencing stolen jewelry. Blake identifies Jimmy as sufficiently gullible and recruits him to deliver packages and messages after work and school. Jim gets paid highly for his errands, so he never questions what exactly he is delivering. Charles forces Kitty to break up with Jimmy after he realizes their relationship is becoming serious. Shortly afterward, Jim drives two of Charlie's henchmen to a late-night "errand," which turns out to be a robbery in which a night watchman is shot. Realizing what he's gotten himself involved with, Jimmy turns to his father, who rebuffs him. Jimmy confronts Blake himself, but Blake threatens to kill him if he does not continue working for him. After the police identify Jimmy as the driver of the getaway car, Blake sends his men to kill Jimmy, but the execution is interrupted, when two passersby happen upon the scene, causing the men to flee and leave behind a beaten Jimmy. Fearing for his life, Jimmy packs a suitcase and spends an indeterminate amount of time hitchhiking and train-hopping. He ends up in a small town where he attempts to rob a diner, but the kindly owner, Al (George Lloyd), recognizes Jimmy as a good boy in a bad situation, and offers him safe harbor and a job, as long as he agrees to give up crime and start going to church. After a period of living and working for Al, Jimmy's life straightens up and he confesses to his crimes. Al agrees to accompany Jimmy back home to turn himself in. Back in Jimmy's hometown, Al takes him to confront Kitty, who confesses that she was forced to break up with him. Jimmy then goes to confront Blake one more time, in the hopes that Blake will also turn himself in to help clear Jimmy's name. Blake refuses and instead pulls a gun on Jimmy; Jimmy attempts to wrestle the gun away, accidentally shooting and killing Blake in the process. The police, alerted by Al, storm Blake's hideout and arrest his men, along with Jimmy. Back in the present, the judge, understanding why Jimmy accuses his parents, acquits Jimmy of manslaughter. However, the judge also finds him guilty on charges of possession of stolen property, gives him a five-year suspended sentence and two years' probation and remands him to the custody of his parents until he is twenty-one. The judge then addresses Jimmy's parents (and the camera), warning that any young man could suffer the same fate as Jimmy if left to neglectful parents. The film concludes with a title card informing the audience that the production company is paying all costs to send the film overseas to entertain troops fighting World War II. ==Cast== * Robert Lowell as James "Jimmy" Wilson — Student * Mary Beth Hughes as Kitty Reed — Torch singer * John Miljan as Dan Wilson — Father * Vivienne Osborne as Mrs. Wilson — Mother * George Meeker as Charles Blake — Gangster * Edward Earle as Judge * George Lloyd as Al Frazier — Diner owner * Patricia Knox as Vera Moore — Kitty's roommate * Florence Johnson as Shirley Clark * Richard Bartell as Joe Holden — Jimmy's boss ==Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode== I Accuse My Parents was featured in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000,"Mystery Science Theater released on DVD."

10134172	I Can't Hold Back	"I Can't Hold Back" is a song recorded by the rock band Survivor. It was the first hit single from their 1984 album Vital Signs (their first album with vocalist Jimi Jamison). The song peaked at #13 in December 1984 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and ranked #73 on the 1985 Year-End Billboard Hot 100. It also peaked at #1 for three weeks on the Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart.Whitburn, Joel (2004). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 8th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 616. ==Background== Like most of Survivor's hits, this song was written by guitarist Frankie Sullivan and keyboard player/guitarist Jim Peterik. While their relationship was becoming strained, they managed to set aside their differences during songwriting sessions. According to Peterik, the writing of this song was the high point of their collaborations, with Sullivan coming up with guitar riffs and Peterik forming melodies and writing most of the lyrics. Peterik had the title in mind for two years before they were able to craft it into a song. After Sullivan came up with a riff, Peterik sang the first line, "There's a story in my eyes." Sullivan then chimed in with the next line, "Turn the pages of desire." From there, they put together this song about a guy whose heart is filled with desire. Peterik says the pre-chorus on this song is what gives it a killer hook: "I can feel you tremble when we touch..." Jamison proved a worthy frontman and a photogenic face of the band, which helped the video for this song get significant airplay on MTV. Ron Nevison, who also worked on albums by Heart, Chicago and Night Ranger, produced the Vital Signs album. Peterik credits him for coming up with a very unusual arrangement on this track, mixing up sections to keep it interesting. The video, which was directed by Bob Radler, was shot in Chicago and partly based on a scene in the movie Risky Business. Jamison's love interest in the clip is Lee Ann Marie, who can be seen riding a float in the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. MTV, which had been on the air only three years, gave the video plenty of spins. == Charts == Chart (1984) Peak position US Billboard Hot 100 13 US Billboard Top Rock Tracks 1 Australia (Kent Music Report) 94 Belgium Singles Chart 18 Canada RPM Singles 19 UK Singles Chart 80 Year-end chart (1985) Rank US Top Pop Singles (Billboard) 73 ==References== Category:1984 songs Category:1984 singles Category:Survivor (band) songs Category:Songs written by Frankie Sullivan Category:Songs written by Jim Peterik Category:Song recordings produced by Ron Nevison Category:Scotti Brothers Records singles
10260905	I (pronoun)	In Modern English, I is the singular, first-person pronoun. == Morphology == In Standard Modern English, _I_ has five distinct word forms: * I: the nominative (subjective) form **I is the only pronoun form that is always capitalized in English. This practice became established in the late 15th century, though lowercase i was sometimes found as late as the 17th century. * me: the accusative (objective) forms (the accusative case is also called the 'oblique'.) * my: the dependent genitive (possessive) form * mine: the independent genitive * myself: the reflexive form ==History== Old English had a first-person pronoun that inflected for four cases and three numbers. I originates from Old English (OE) , which had in turn originated from the continuation of Proto-Germanic *ik, and ek; The asterisk denotes an unattested form, but ek was attested in the Elder Futhark inscriptions (in some cases notably showing the variant eka; see also ek erilaz). Linguists assume ik to have developed from the unstressed variant of ek. Variants of ic were used in various English dialects up until the 1600s. The Proto-Germanic root came, in turn, from the Proto Indo-European language (PIE) *eg-. Old and Middle English first-person pronouns Singular Dual Plural Early OE Late OE ME Early Late ME Early Late ME Nominative Accusative Dative Genitive *Early OE circa , late, and ME Old English and are from Proto-Germanic *meke (accusative) and *mes (dative). Mine is from Proto-Germanic *minaz, and my is a reduced form of mine. All of these are from PIE root *me-. == Syntax == === Functions === I can appear as a subject, object, determiner, or predicative complement. The reflexive form also appears as an adjunct. Me occasionally appears as a modifier in a noun phrase. * Subject: _I_ 'm here; me being here; _my_ being there; I paid for _myself_ to be here. * Object: She saw _me_ ; She introduced him to _me_ ; I saw myself. * Predicative complement: The only person there was _me_ / _I_. * Dependent determiner: I met _my_ friend. * Independent determiner: This is _mine_. * Adjunct: I did it _myself_. * Modifier: the _me_ generation ====Coordinative constructions==== The above applies when the pronoun stands alone as the subject or object. In some varieties of English (particularly in formal registers), those rules also apply in coordinative constructions such as "you and I". * "My husband and I wish you a merry Christmas." * "Between you and me..." In many dialects of informal English, the accusative is sometimes used when the pronoun is part of a coordinative subject construction, as in * "Phil and me wish you a merry Christmas." This is stigmatized but common in many dialects. === Dependents === Pronouns rarely take dependents, but it is possible for me to have many of the same kind of dependents as other noun phrases. * Relative clause modifier: the me _I'd like to be_ ; *me _I'd like to be_ * Determiner: _the_ me I'd like to be; *the me * Adjective phrase modifier: the _real_ me * Adverb phrase external modifier: _Not even_ me == Semantics == I's referents are limited to the individual person speaking or writing, the first person. I is always definite and specific. == Pronunciation == According to the OED, the following pronunciations are used: Form Plain Unstressed Recording I (UK) /ʌɪ/ (US) /aɪ/ female speaker with UK accent me (UK) /miː/ (US) /mi/ /mi/, /mɪ/ /mɪ/ female speaker with US accent my (UK) /mʌɪ/ (US) /maɪ/ female speaker with US accent mine (UK) /mʌɪn/ (US) /maɪn/ female speaker with US accent myself (UK) /mʌɪˈsɛlf/ (US) /maɪˈsɛlf/ /mᵻˈsɛlf/ /məˈsɛlf/ female speaker with US accent ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * "Etymology of I".

1031735	I Am Cuba	I Am Cuba (; , Ya - Kuba) is a 1964 anthology drama film directed by Mikhail Kalatozov at Mosfilm. An international co-production between the Soviet Union and Cuba, it was not received well by either the Russian or Cuban publicThe New Cult Canon: I am Cuba . The A.V. Club, May 1. 2008. and was almost completely forgotten until it was re-discovered by filmmakers in the United States thirty years later. The acrobatic tracking shots and idiosyncratic mise en scene prompted Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese to begin a campaign to restore the film in the early 1990s. The film is shot in black and white, sometimes using infrared film obtained from the Soviet military2005 Brazilian documentary The Siberian Mammoth to exaggerate contrast (making trees and sugar cane almost white, and skies very dark but still obviously sunny). Most shots are in extreme wide-angle and the camera passes very close to its subjects, whilst still largely avoiding having those subjects ever look directly at the camera. == Plot == The movie consists of four distinct short stories about the suffering of the Cuban people and their reactions, varying from passive amazement in the first, to a guerrilla march in the last. Between the stories, a female narrator (credited "The Voice of Cuba") says such things as, "I am Cuba, the Cuba of the casinos, but also of the people." The first story (centered on the character Maria) shows the destitute Cuban masses contrasted with the splendor in the American-run gambling casinos. Maria lives in a shanty-town on the edge of Havana and hopes to marry her fruit-seller boyfriend, Rene. Rene is unaware that she leads an unhappy double-life as "Betty", a bar prostitute at one of the Havana casinos catering to rich Americans. One night, her client asks her if he can see where she lives rather than take her to his own room. She takes him to her small hovel where she reluctantly undresses in front of him. The next morning he tosses her a few dollars and takes her most prized possession, her crucifix necklace. As he is about to leave Rene walks in and sees his ashamed fiancée. The American callously says, "Goodbye Betty!" as he makes his exit. He is disoriented by the squalor he encounters as he tries to find his way out of the area. The next story is about a farmer, Pedro, who just raised his biggest crop of sugar yet. However, his landlord rides up to the farm as he is harvesting his crops and tells him that he has sold the land that Pedro lives on to United Fruit, and Pedro and his family must leave immediately. Pedro asks what about the crops? The landowner says, "you raised them on my land. I'll let you keep the sweat you put into growing them, but that is all," and he rides off. Pedro lies to his children and tells them everything is fine. He gives them all the money he has and tells them to have a fun day in town. After they leave, he sets all of his crops and house on fire. He then dies from the smoke inhalation. The third story describes the suppression of rebellious students led by a character named Enrique at Havana University (featuring one of the longest camera shots). Enrique is frustrated with the small efforts of the group and wants to do something drastic. He goes off on his own planning on assassinating the chief of police, however when he gets him in his sights, he sees that the police chief is surrounded by his young children, and Enrique cannot bring himself to pull the trigger. While he is away, his fellow revolutionaries are printing flyers. They are infiltrated by police officers who arrest them. One of the revolutionaries begins throwing flyers out to the crowd below only to be shot by one of the police officers. Later on, Enrique is leading a protest at the university. More police are there to break up the crowd with fire hoses. Enrique is shot after the demonstration becomes a riot. At the end, his body is carried through the streets; he has become a martyr to his cause. The final part shows Mariano, a typical farmer, who rejects the requests of a revolutionary soldier to join the ongoing war. The soldier appeals to Mariano's desire for a better life for his children, but Mariano only wants to live in peace and insists the soldier leave. Immediately thereafter though, the government's planes begin bombing the area indiscriminately. Mariano's home is destroyed and his son is killed. He then joins the rebels in the Sierra Maestra Mountains, ultimately leading to a triumphal march into Havana to proclaim the revolution. == Cast == * Sergio Corrieri as Alberto * Salvador Wood * José Gallardo as Pedro * Raúl García as Enrique * Luz María Collazo as Maria / Betty * Jean Bouise as Jim (in Cuban version) (as Jean Bouisse) * Alberto Morgan as Ángel * Celia Rodriguez as Gloria (in Cuban version) (as Zilia Rodríguez) * Fausto Mirabal == Production == Shortly after the 1959 Cuban Revolution overthrew the United States-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, the socialist Castro government, isolated by the United States after the latter broke diplomatic and trade relations in 1961, turned to the USSR in many areas, including for film partnerships. The Soviet government, interested in promoting international socialism, and perhaps in need to further familiarize itself with its new ally, agreed to collaborate with the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos (ICAIC), and finance a film about the Cuban revolution. The director was given considerable freedom to complete the work, and was given much help from both the Soviet and Cuban governments. The film made use of many innovative techniques, such as coating a watertight camera's lens with a special submarine periscope cleaner, so the camera could be submerged and lifted out of the water without any drops on the lens or film. At one point, more than 1,000 Cuban soldiers were moved to a remote location to shoot one scene—this despite the then-ongoing Cuban Missile Crisis. In another scene, the camera follows a flag over a body, held high on a stretcher, along a crowded street. Then it stops and slowly moves upwards for at least four storeys until it is filming the flagged body from above a building. Without stopping, it then starts tracking sideways and enters through a window into a cigar factory, then goes straight towards a rear window where the cigar workers are watching the procession. The camera finally passes through the window and appears to float along over the middle of the street between the buildings. These shots were accomplished by the camera operator having the camera attached to his vest—like an early, crude version of a Steadicam—while also wearing a vest with hooks on the back. An assembly line of technicians would hook and unhook the operator's vest to various pulleys and cables that spanned floors and building roof tops. == Reception == Despite its dazzling technical and formal achievements receiving excellent support, and the participation of the renowned team of Soviet cinematographers Mikhail Kalatozov and Sergei Urusevsky (winners of the 1958 Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or for The Cranes are Flying, another virtuosistic art film, and also in the midst of the Cold War), the movie was given a rather cold reaction by audiences. In Havana it was criticized for showing a stereotypical view of Cubans, and in Moscow it was considered naïve, not sufficiently revolutionary, even too sympathetic to the lives of the bourgeois, pre-Castro classes. Cameraman Alexander Calzatti stated that the crew "was so enthusiastic [that] we were infected by it, and we worked very hard"; as a result "very soon after we came back to Russia, more than half of our crew died. I survived because I was very young.""The Astonishing Images of I Am Cuba", George E. Turner 2019-05-17, American Cinematographer Also, upon its original release, the movie never reached Western countries largely because it was a communist production, in the midst of the Cold War era, and due to the United States embargo against Cuba. == Restoration == Until the USSR collapsed in the early 1990s, I Am Cuba was virtually unknown. In 1992, a print of the film was screened at the Telluride Film Festival. The San Francisco International Film Festival screened the film in 1993. Shortly after the festival, three film professionals who had screened I Am Cuba at the San Francisco screening contacted friends at Milestone Films, a small New York film distributor specializing in the release of once-lost and neglected older films. Milestone screened a slightly blurry, unsubtitled VHS tape of the film and then went about acquiring the distribution rights from Mosfilm in Russia. Milestone's release opened at New York's Film Forum in March 1995. For the tenth anniversary of the film release, Milestone debuted a new 35 mm restoration of I Am Cuba without the Russian overdubbing in September 2005. Milestone released an Ultimate Edition DVD boxset at the time as well, with a video appreciation from Scorsese. On March 19, 2018 the trailer for a new 4K restoration by Milestone films was released. It became available later that year on Milestone films' Vimeo powered streaming service. Sometime after April 2021 this film was removed from the Milestone films streaming catalog because they sold the film's license to another company. Until that company announces their re-release of the restored version of the film, which may happen in the beginning of 2022, Milestone films is not at liberty to say who bought the license. Milestone films' customers that purchased home use 4K streaming rights to the film were offered an HD digital download of the film and if those customers asked for a 4K download they were given a refund on their purchase. This 4K restoration has therefore never been made available in 4K. == Documentary == In 2005, a documentary about the making of I Am Cuba was released called Soy Cuba: O Mamute Siberiano or I Am Cuba: the Siberian Mammoth, directed by the Brazilian Vicente Ferraz. The documentary looks at the history of the making of the film, explains some of the technical feats of the film, and features interviews with many of the people who worked on it. == See also == * Cinema of Cuba * List of Cuban films ==References== == External links == * * * * * From Russia with Love, an article by Richard Gott from The Guardian November 2005 * "The 34 best political movies ever made", Ann Hornaday, The Washington Post Jan. 23, 2020), ranked #28 Category:1964 films Category:1964 in the Soviet Union Category:1960s avant-garde and experimental films Category:Cuba–Soviet Union relations Category:Cuban avant-garde and experimental films Category:Films directed by Mikhail Kalatozov Category:Films set in Cuba Category:Films shot in Cuba Category:Soviet avant-garde and experimental films Category:Soviet revolutionary propaganda films Category:1960s Spanish-language films Category:Mosfilm films Category:Films about the Cuban Revolution Category:Films set in Havana Category:Films shot in Havana Category:1960s English-language films
1044676	I Am the Cheese	I Am the Cheese is a young adult novel by the American writer Robert Cormier, published in 1977. ==Plot== The novel opens with protagonist Adam Farmer biking from his home in the fictional town of Monument, Massachusetts, (based on Cormier's hometown of Leominster, Massachusetts) to visit his father in the fictional town of Rutterburg, Vermont. The story alternates with transcripts of tapes between a "subject" and Brint. The subject receives psychotherapy and is interrogated by Brint. As the book continues, it is revealed that Adam is the subject, formerly Paul Delmonte of a small New York town. His father, "David Farmer", was a newspaper reporter who was enrolled in the Witness Protection Program (WPP). The family moved to Monument and escaped several close calls with their identities, but the parents are killed in the penultimate chapter in a car collision. Adam/Paul survives and is taken to a government mental asylum. The last chapter implies that WPP agents killed the family and reveals that Paul is regularly interrogated on the topic. Each time, Paul is unable to handle his realization of his past and embarks on his delusional bike ride across the ground of the facility. At the end of the last tape, Brint recommends authorization to murder Adam. == Characters == * Adam Farmer (Paul Delmonte) – teenage protagonist * David Farmer (Anthony Delmonte) - Adam's father, a former newspaper man. He pretends to work for an insurance company. * Louise Farmer/Delmonte - Adam's mother * Amy Hertz - Adam's friend and love interest * Brint - Adam's questioner and "guide" as his psychotherapist * Mr. Grey - agent in the Witness Protection Program * Arthur - a fat man in the town of Hookset who tells Adam of Junior Varney * Dr. Dupont - a friendly doctor in a mental hospital; Adam is his patient * Junior Varney - a troublemaker and thief in Hookset * Whipper and friends - bullies in Carver * Old man by the gas station - warns him about trusting strangers * The elderly couple - the man helps him out of the ditch, while the woman criticizes him *Aunt Martha - the only relative they're allowed to talk to ==Title== This quote is the last verse from "The Farmer In The Dell", a song that Adam sings during the book: > The cheese stands alone > The cheese stands alone > Heigh-ho, the merry-o > The cheese stands alone He sings many of these songs throughout the novel. The song contains several characters, each taking someone with them when the farmer leaves, yet the cheese has nobody. Adam believes that he is the cheese. He is the bait in a trap. Adam is alone in the world, his mother dead and his father missing, and he lives in a hospital. Another point is that his father had taught him the song, possibly as a way to reinforce the new name, "Farmer," they had adopted. ==Literary significance and criticism== Started in 1975, I Am the Cheese began Cormier's experimentation with first-person, present-tense narration. When Cormier sent the manuscript to the publisher of his previous novel, The Chocolate War, he was confused and depressed, convinced that he was alienating his new young adult audience because of the complex and ambiguous story. However, I Am the Cheese proved to be a success. ==Awards and nominations== I Am the Cheese was named to five annual book lists according to the publisher description of the 20th anniversary edition. It won the 1997 Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association as the best English-language children's book that did not win a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. It is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity. ==Film adaptation== I Am the Cheese was released as a movie in 1983, directed by Robert Jiras and starring Robert MacNaughton, Hope Lange, Don Murray, Lee Richardson, Cynthia Nixon and Robert Wagner. The screenplay was written by David Lange (Hope Lange's brother) and Robert Jiras. ==Publication history== * 1977, USA, Pantheon Books, , Pub date ? ? 1977, hardback (First edition) * 1977, USA, Laurel-Leaf Library, , Pub date ? ? 1977, ? binding * 1977, UK, Victor Gollancz, Ltd, * 1977, UK, Fontana Lions * 1997, Knopf, 20th anniversary edition, , "with a new introduction by the author * 2007, Knopf, 30th anniversary edition (1st Knopf trade paper) "includes Reader's Guide and interview with the author" WorldCat libraries report holding Danish (1986), Catalan (1987), Spanish (1998), Chinese, Polish, Serbian and Korean-language editions.

10468100	I Am an American Soldier	I Am an American Soldier is a 2007 documentary film about the Iraq War, produced by John Laurence. "One Year in Iraq with the 101st Airborne." ==Synopsis== This is the inside story of what happens to a company of American soldiers - ninety-two air assault troopers from the 3rd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Rakkasans) - who are sent to fight, suffer and try to survive a full year's tour of duty in Iraq. From the final stages of their training and farewells at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, through their deployment to Baghdad, Samarra and Tikrit, and then the return home to their loved ones, this is a searching examination of the combat, the life and death struggles, and the profound changes in the lives of these professional soldiers who set out with hope and confidence of making a difference in Iraq. ==Access== The British/American filmmakers were given unprecedented access to the soldiers for fourteen months: from September 2005, to November 2006, and accompanied them into the most dangerous places. The result is a feature film that attempts to examine the Iraq War with ruthless scrutiny, with honesty and fairness, and reveals courage of an uncommon kind. Before they leave Fort Campbell, hundreds of soldiers shout “Hoo-ah” in response to their brigade commander's dramatic war speech in which he tells them to "look like a killer" at all times in Iraq. The film begins by demonstrating the lethal force of America's best-trained soldiers. But that is not how the rest of the story unfolds. The soldiers of Charlie Troop find it increasingly difficult to carry out their mission in a hostile environment, full of deception and danger. A carefully planned attempt to destroy a team of insurgents who are firing rockets and mortars at them, the troops are sabotaged by the over-protective actions of a parent unit from the Third Infantry Division. Despite vigilant surveillance work, superior weapons and training, and all the energy of their warrior natures, the soldiers are thrown into the most frustrating mission conceivable. This is a film about young men and their commanders who prepare in earnest for their duty, who understand what they are meant to do in Iraq, and how - through their experiences in Samarra, Baghdad and Tikrit - dramatic changes take place in their perspectives. It is about soldiers who fight for their lives when their humvee is destroyed by insurgents. It is about a specialist who shoots up a car full of people who later turn out to be civilians. It is about mothers and young wives, gathered at a military funeral for the soldiers killed in action in Iraq, mourning their lost sons and husbands. This is their story, narrated by the soldiers and their families. It provides the most revealing, in-depth look inside the U.S. Army at war ever produced on film. Between them, Laurence, Green and Thompson have covered more than thirty wars since Vietnam in 1965, and have won every major award in broadcast journalism in the United States. ==References== ==External links== *I Am an American Soldier website * Category:2007 films Category:Documentary films about the Iraq War Category:2000s English-language films

The possibility of salvation seems to loom in the form of their wealthy American landlord Simon Cotton and his brother Neil. Although Simon initially spurns her, Rose is determined to make him fall in love with her and succeeds. A wedding is arranged and Cassandra appears to be left on the sidelines. Cassandra is confused not only by her feelings for the Cottons but also for Stephen Colley. Stephen is the incredibly attractive son of the Mortmains' former chef who acts as a handyman to the family and is deeply in love with Cassandra. But events spiral out of control, and before the summer ends many expectations will have been overturned. ==Production== Parts of the film were shot in Laxey film studio on the Isle of Man.

1093364	I Confess (film)	I Confess is a 1953 American film noir directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and starring Montgomery Clift as Fr. Michael William Logan, a Catholic priest, Anne Baxter as Ruth Grandfort, and Karl Malden as Inspector Larrue. The film is based on a 1902 French play by Paul Anthelme titled Nos deux consciences (Our Two Consciences), which Hitchcock saw in the 1930s. The screenplay was written by George Tabori."I Confess: Notes". Turner Classic Movies. Accessed October 15, 2022. Filming took place largely on location in Quebec City with numerous shots of the city landscape and interiors of its churches and other emblematic buildings, such as the Château Frontenac. ==Plot== left|thumb|240px|Montgomery Clift in the I Confess film trailer Father Logan is a devout Catholic priest in Ste. Marie's Church in Quebec City. He employs German immigrant married couple Otto and Anna Keller as caretaker and housekeeper, respectively. Otto Keller also works part-time as a gardener for a shady lawyer, Villette. The film begins late one evening as a man wearing a cassock walks away from Villette's home with the lawyer dead on the floor inside. Shortly afterward, in the church confessional, Keller confesses to Father Logan that he accidentally killed Villette while trying to rob him. Keller tells his wife about his deed and assures her that the priest will not say anything because the priest is required to keep anything revealed during confession inviolate. The next morning, Keller goes to Villette's house at his regularly scheduled gardening time and reports the death to the police. Logan also goes to the crime scene after hearing Mrs. Keller mention that her husband is there and finds the police there. Logan is interviewed by Inspector Larrue, who witnesses Logan talking to a woman after he leaves. At the police station, two young girls tell Inspector Larrue they saw a priest leaving Villette's house. This prompts Larrue to call Father Logan in for more questioning, but Logan refuses to provide any information about the murder. Foolishly and prematurely suspecting Logan, Larrue orders a detective to follow Logan and contacts Crown Prosecutor Robertson, who is attending a party hosted by Ruth Grandfort, the woman Logan talked to outside of Villette's house, and her husband Pierre, a member of the Quebec legislature. Ruth overhears Robertson discussing Logan, and Larrue's detective discovers her identity by following her home the next day after she meets with Logan to warn him that he is a suspect. Suspecting everyone the active Pastor speaks to as a suspect, Larrue calls Ruth and Logan in for questioning, and Ruth blurts out the truth, narrating a series of flashbacks: She and Logan fell in love when they were childhood friends, but he went to fight in World War II with the Regina Rifle Regiment and eventually stopped writing to her. She eventually married Pierre, for whom she had been working as secretary. The day after Logan returned from the war, he and Ruth spent the day on a nearby island. A storm forced them to shelter for the night in a gazebo, and Villette found them there in the morning, recognizing Ruth as Mrs. Grandfort. The next time Ruth saw Logan was several years later when he was ordained as a priest. Villette had recently asked Ruth to persuade her husband to help him escape a tax scandal, with the condition that if she refused, he would publicize the night she spent with Logan. She met with Logan on the night of the murder, and Logan agreed to intercede with Villette. right|thumb|240px|Anne Baxter in the I Confess trailer Ruth's meeting with Father Logan occurred between 9 and 11 pm on the night of the murder, but Larrue shows Robinson Villette's autopsy report that indicates that Villette couldn't have died before 11:30 pm. The fact that Ruth and Logan concluded their meeting at 11 pm leaves Logan without an alibi. Also, Villette had been blackmailing Ruth. Knowing he will be arrested, Logan turns himself in the next day at Larrue's office. Keller has planted the bloody cassock among Logan's belongings, and when Logan is tried in court, Keller testifies that he saw Logan enter the church after the murder, acting suspiciously. The jury concludes that Father Logan is not guilty, due to insufficient evidence, but the crowd outside the courthouse mobs Logan as he leaves the court. This upsets Keller's wife to such an extent that she starts to shout that Logan was innocent. Keller, realizing that he's about to be revealed as the murderer, shoots Alma, resulting in her death. He then flees but is pursued by police officers. Larrue finally realizes that Keller is the murderer, corners him in the grand ballroom of the Château Frontenac, and tricks him into confessing the murder. Keller, suspecting that Father Logan had betrayed him to the police, threatens to shoot Logan. However, Logan prefers peace over violence, and advances into the ballroom to talk with Keller. Immediately followed by police officers, Logan talks with Keller, his main intention being to prevent a ballroom gunfight; but Keller shoots at Logan. A police sharpshooter shoots Keller when Keller tries to shoot Logan; and Keller calls to Father Logan in extremis and dies immediately after asking Logan for forgiveness. ==Cast== ==Production== I Confess had one of the longest pre-productions of any Hitchcock film, with almost 12 writers working on the script for Hitchcock over a period of eight years (Hitchcock had taken time off for the wedding of his daughter Patricia Hitchcock in 1951, and Hitchcock was in the midst of dissolving his partnership in Transatlantic Pictures with Sidney Bernstein). In the original screenplay, following the source play, the priest and his lover had an illegitimate baby, and the priest was executed at the end of the film. These elements were removed at the insistence of executives at Warner Brothers who feared a negative reaction. Hitchcock first hired Anita Björk as the female lead after seeing her in Miss Julie (1951). However, when she arrived in Hollywood with her lover and their baby, Warner Bros. insisted that Hitchcock find another actress for the role. Shooting took place in Hollywood and Quebec from August 21 to October 22, 1952. Hitchcock had planned on using Quebec churches at no cost. When the local diocese read the original script by George Tabori, it objected to the priest's execution and rescinded its permission. When Tabori refused to change the script, Hitchcock brought in William Archibald to rewrite it. Hitchcock, as was his custom, created detailed storyboards for each scene. He could not understand Clift's Method acting technique and quickly became frustrated with Clift when he blew take after take for failing to follow Hitchcock's instructions. Cognizant of the difficulty non-Catholics would have in understanding the priest's reluctance to expose Keller, Hitchcock said: Alfred Hitchcock's cameo appearance occurs during the second minute—right after the opening credits—as he walks across the top of a stairway. ==Reception== The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times faulted an "obviously padded" and "a suspenseless script," explaining that "only the most credulous patron will be worried for very long that the hero will not be delivered from his dilemma by some saving grace. And this realization well unburdens the situation of any real suspense." Crowther's review concluded that "Mr. Hitchcock does manage to inject little glints of imagery and invent little twists of construction that give the film the smooth, neat glitter of his style. Shot on location in Quebec, it has a certain atmospheric flavor, too. But it never gets up and goes places. It just ambles and drones along." Variety wrote that the film was "short of the suspense one would expect and overlong on talk," although it did note "a number of top-flight performances." Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post wrote in a negative review that the film "asks for more than the usual suspension of disbelief" because "the priest is not helpless, a fact which the writers and director attempt to forget at the cost of the film's credibility from the earliest reel. It would certainly seem that so young a priest's superiors would have had more to do with his problem, if not at first, surely before the matter came to public trial ... So promising an idea as is the use of the confessional in framing a murder case and respectful as the picture appears to be of matters ecclesiastic, the basic conception is false. The result is a tricked-up picture unworthy of the suave master of movie thrillers." John McCarten of The New Yorker was also negative, writing: "Presumably, this is meant to be a kind of mystery drama. What it actually amounts to, though, is an exposition of the difficulties a priest can get into by keeping the secrets of the confessional inviolate. The theme is prinked up with murder and romance, but neither, as represented here, makes for suspense or entertainment ... it is possible that Montgomery Clift, who plays the part, was ill-advised to portray the priest as a sort of bemused juvenile, plainly too abstracted to lead one lamb, let alone a flock." A mixed review in The Monthly Film Bulletin declared the film "rather less successful than Strangers on a Train and a good deal more so than anything else Hitchcock has done since the ill-fated Rope ... The final chase through the huge Chateau Frontenac seems a touch that Hitchcock could not resist: out of keeping with the generally somber tone of the film, it provides a showily melodramatic climax. The unresolved split between the straightforward thriller technique and the more penetrating psychological study of character, indeed, makes itself felt as a weakness at intervals throughout the film." The Chicago Tribune also was mixed, declaring that "While it has scenery and carefully allotted bits of tension, the film is crowded and devious plot-wise and doesn't rank with Director Hitchcock's previous bests. The finale is slightly overdone, even if it does manage to bring in a famed hotel." Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times wrote one of the positive reviews and declared that Hitchcock "has fashioned an absorbing screen drama, one of the solidest and most expertly made of recent weeks. In his careful treatment Hitchcock has gone deeper into human relationships than is usual with him, relying less on the physical chase or on theatrical props like trains and merry-go-rounds than on the interplay of faith and doubt to create his famous brand of suspense." Harrison's Reports wrote, "Living up to his reputation as a master of the suspense film, Alfred Hitchcock has fashioned a powerful dramatic entertainment in 'I Confess.' ... It is not a cheerful picture, but it holds one tense throughout." The film was banned in Ireland because it showed a priest having a relationship with a woman (even though, in the film, the relationship takes place before the character becomes a priest). The film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. I Confess was a favorite among French New Wave filmmakers, according to filmmaker/historian Peter Bogdanovich.Hitchcock's Confession: A Look at "I Confess", featurette included on the I Confess DVD. Film critic Sarah Ortiz has described I Confess as "the most Catholic film of Hitchcock's films." In 2012, The Guardian called the film "A forgotten albeit flawed masterpiece". On Rotten Tomatoes, I Confess holds a rating of 81% from 31 reviews. ==Adaptations== I Confess was adapted to the radio program Lux Radio Theatre on September 21, 1953, with Cary Grant in Montgomery Clift's role. ==See also== The Confessional (Le Confessionnal), directed by Robert Lepage, a 1995 film which dramatizes the filming of I Confess as the backdrop for a thematically related story. ==References== ===Additional references=== * I Confess DVD documentary ==External links== * * * * * ===Streaming audio=== * I Confess on Lux Radio Theater: September 21, 1953 Category:1953 films Category:1953 crime drama films Category:1950s psychological thriller films Category:American crime drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Film noir Category:Films scored by Dimitri Tiomkin Category:Films about Catholic priests Category:Films about Catholicism Category:American films based on plays Category:Films directed by Alfred Hitchcock Category:Films produced by Alfred Hitchcock Category:Films set in Quebec City Category:Warner Bros. films Category:1950s English-language films Category:1950s American films
1094946	I Ching divination	thumb|upright=1.7|I Ching fortuneteller in Japan, 1914 I Ching divination is a form of cleromancy applied to the I Ching. The text of the I Ching consists of sixty-four hexagrams: six-line figures of yin (broken) or yang (solid) lines, and commentaries on them. There are two main methods of building up the lines of the hexagram, using either 50 yarrow sticks or three coins. Some of the lines may be designated "old" lines, in which case the lines are subsequently changed to create a second hexagram. The text relating to the hexagram(s) and old lines (if any) is studied, and the meanings derived from such study can be interpreted as an oracle. == Methods == Each hexagram is six lines, written sequentially one above the other; each of the lines represents a state that is either yin ( : dark, feminine, etc., represented by a broken line) or yang ( : light, masculine, etc., a solid line), and either old (moving or changing, represented by an "X" written on the middle of a yin line, or a circle written on the middle of a yang line) or young (static, unchanging). The usual methods for consulting the I Ching as an oracle produce a "sacred" or "ritual" number for each type of line: 6 (for an old yin line), 7 (young yang), 8 (young yin), or 9 (old yang). The six lines are produced in order using the chosen method (see below for examples), beginning at the first (lowest) one and proceeding upward to the sixth (uppermost) line, each with its corresponding number. Then, the commentaries applying to the generated hexagram are studied; if the hexagram contains no old lines at all, that concludes the consultation, but if there are one or more old lines, the separate commentary for each such line is also studied. Then, the lines are appropriately changed (any old yin lines into young yang lines, and any old yang lines into young yin lines), which—with the young lines in the original hexagram remaining the same—results in a second, different, hexagram, the commentarial material on which is then also studied. The method used by the diviner to generate the hexagram(s) depends on their circumstances and beliefs; the yarrow-stalk method is usually employed by traditionalists who find significance in its complexity, and in the resulting time needed to manipulate the stalks to produce a hexagram. Coin methods, and others, are used either by those short of time, or by fortune- tellers who need a quick reading. There are also methods to generate a hexagram by interpreting the time, direction, person, etc., instead of throwing coins or dividing and counting yarrow stalks. Several of the methods described below force exactly one, or no, moving lines; the traditional yarrow-stalk method allows from zero to six moving lines. The yarrow-stalk method favours static lines over moving lines in the ratio 3:1. === Precursor to I Ching: Cracks in turtle shell === Plastromancy or the turtle-shell oracle is probably the earliest recorded form of fortune telling. The diviner would apply heat to a piece of a turtle shell (sometimes with a hot poker), and interpret the resulting cracks. The cracks were sometimes annotated with inscriptions, the oldest Chinese writings that have been discovered. This oracle predated the earliest versions of the Zhou Yi (dated from about 1100 BC) by hundreds of years. A variant on this method was to use ox shoulder bones, a practice called scapulimancy. When thick material was to be cracked, the underside was thinned by carving with a knife. === Yarrow stalks === thumb|A bunch of 50 yarrow (Achillea millefolium subsp. millefolium var. millefolium) stalks, used for I Ching divination. Hexagrams may be generated by the manipulation of yarrow stalks. These are usually genuine Achillea millefolium stalks that have been cut and prepared for such purposes, or any form of wooden rod or sticks (the quality ranging from cheap hardwood to very expensive red sandalwood, etc.) which are plain, lacquered, or varnished. When genuine Achillea is used, varieties local to the diviner are considered the best, as they would contain qi closer to, and more in tune with, the diviner, or they may come from a particularly spiritual or relevant place, such as on the grounds of a Confucian temple. When not in use, they are kept in a cloth or silk bag/pouch or a wooden case/box. Fifty yarrow stalks are used, though one stalk is set aside at the beginning and takes no further part in the process of consultation. The remaining forty-nine stalks are roughly sorted into two piles, and then for the right hand pile one stalk is initially "remaindered"; then the pile is "cast off" in lots of four (i.e., groups of four stalks are removed). The remainders from each half are combined (traditionally placed between the fingers of one hand during the counting process) and set aside, with the process then repeated twice (i.e., for a total of three times). The total number of stalks in the remainder pile will necessarily (if the procedure has been followed correctly) be 9 or 5, in the first count, and 8 or 4, in the second. 9 or 8 is assigned a value of 2; 5 or 4, a value of 3. The total of the three passes will be one of just four values: 6 (2+2+2), 7 (2+2+3), 8 (2+3+3), or 9 (3+3+3)—that value is the number of the first line. The forty-nine stalks are then gathered and the entire procedure repeated to generate each of the remaining five lines of the hexagram. The yarrow-stalk method produces unequal probabilities for obtaining each of the four totals, as shown in the table. Compared to the three-coin method discussed next, the probabilities of the lines produced by the yarrow- stalk method are significantly different.

The three-coin method came into use over a thousand years after the yarrow-stalk method. The quickest, easiest, and most popular method by far, it has largely supplanted yarrow stalks, but produces outcomes with different likelihoods. Three coins are tossed at once; each coin is given a value of 2 or 3, depending upon whether it is tails or heads, respectively. Six such tosses make the hexagram. Some fortune-tellers use an empty tortoise shell to shake the coins in before throwing them on a dish or plate. ==== Modified Three-coin method ==== The three-coin method can be modified to have the same probabilities as the yarrow-stalk method by having one of the coins be of a second coin type, or in some way be marked as special (i.e., be distinguishable from the other coins). All three coins are tossed at once. The results are counted just as in the original three-coin method, with two exceptions: one to make yin less likely to move, and one to make yang more likely to move. (The probability for 6/8/9/7 in the coin method is 2/6/2/6, but in the yarrow-stalk method is 1/7/3/5; hence, 6 has to occur less often, and 9 has to occur more often.) In the case where the special coin is tails and the other two are both tails—which would normally produce a 6—re-flip the marked coin: if it remains tails, then treat it as a 6 (moving yin); otherwise, it remains an 8 (static yin). As a 6 can become a 6 or an 8, it reduces the probability of the moving 6. In other words, it makes the old yin less likely to change (or move). In the case where the special coin is heads and the other two are both tails—which would normally produce an 7—re-flip the marked coin: if it remains heads, then it remains as a 7 (static yang); otherwise, it becomes a 9 (moving yang). As a 7 can become a 7 or an 9, it reduces the probability of the static 7. In other words, it makes the young yang less likely and hence more yangs change as a result. This method retains the 50% chance of yin:yang, but changes the ratio of moving yin to static yin from 1:3 to 1:7; likewise, it changes the ratio of moving yang to static yang from 1:3 to 3:5, which is the same probabilities as the yarrow-stalk method. ==== Two-coin method ==== Some purists contend that there is a problem with the three-coin method because its probabilities differ from the more ancient, yarrow-stalk, method. In fact, over the centuries there have even been other methods used for consulting the oracle. The two-coin method involves tossing one pair of coins twice: on the first toss, two heads give a value of 2, and anything else is 3; on the second toss, each coin is valued separately, to give a sum from 6 to 9, as above. This results in the same distribution of probabilities as for the yarrow-stalk method. ==== Simplified two-coin method ==== A modified version of the two- coin method improves on the original on several aspects. First, while maintaining the probabilities of the traditional yarrow-stalk method, it simplifies outcomes such that they become intuitive at first sight, without need of further calculations. Second, it reduces the average number of coin throws per hexagram by 25%, from 12 to 9. It does so by requiring to throw the coins a second time only if both coins land on the same face (either both heads, or both tails), thus only in 50% of instances. Third, it is easy to memorize, as it clearly identifies heads with yang, and tails with yin, and a greater share of heads/tails with old (aka mature, moving, changing) yang/yin. The modified two-coin method involves tossing one pair of coins of different size or shape. The larger, or heavier coin is assigned primacy (and is reported here as first, dominant, outcome) while the outcome of the smaller one comes second. Let H be heads and T tails. If the coins land H, T, yang dominates and the outcome is young yang, unchanging. There is no need to throw the coins again for the same line. If the coins land T, H, then yin dominates and the outcome is young yin, unchanging. Again, there is no need to throw the coins again for the same line. If the coins land both on heads (H, H) then the outcome is for sure yang, but one must throw again to verify if the yang is changing (aka old) or unchanging (young). In case the second throw yields at least one H (either H, H, or H, T, or T, H), then the yang is changing. If both coins land on T (T, T) at second throw then the yang is unchanging. If the coins land both on tails (T, T) then the outcome is for sure yin, but one must throw again to verify if the yin is changing or unchanging. In case the second throw yields both tails (T, T), then the yin is changing. If any of the two coins lands on H (either H, T, or T, H, or H, H) at second throw then the yin is unchanging. The modified two-coin method yields old yang (changing) 3/16 of the times. Unchanging yang 5/16 times, and unchanging yin 7/16. The remaining 1/16 outcomes is old yin (changing). It is considered simplified as it reduces the number of throws and calculations needed to correctly identify the outcome of each hexagram line, compared to any other method. While this has its advantages, some purists consider the time required to build the hexagram as a fundamental aspect of I Ching divination, for its ceremonial as well as introspective purposes. This said, any other coin based method can be considered similarly lacking on this regard, when compared to the yarrow-stalk method. As is the case for the conventional two-coin method and the four coin method, the simplified two-coin method can be boiled down to binary numbers, simply interpreting any H as 1 and any T as 0. Then, old yin takes value of 0000 (0 in decimal numbers), unchanging yin values between 0001 and 0111 (1 to 7), unchanging yang those between 1000 and 1100 (8 to 12), and old yang from 1101 to 1111 (13 to 15). This also clearly showcases the relative probabilities of each outcome. ==== Four coins ==== With tails assigned the value 0 (zero) and heads the value 1, four coins tossed at once can be used to generate a four-bit binary number, the right-most coin indicating the first bit, the next coin (to the first's left) indicating the next bit, etc. The number 0000 is called old yin; the next three numbers—0001, 0010, and 0011 (the binary numbers whose decimal equivalents are 1, 2, and 3, respectively)—are called old yang, with a similar principle applied to the remaining twelve outcomes. This gives identical results to the yarrow-stalk method. Coins Binary Decimal Line T T T T 0000 0 ~~\---~~ x ~~\---~~ T T T H 0001 1| ~~\---o---~~ T T H T 0010 2| ~~\---o---~~ T T H H 0011 3| ~~\---o---~~ Coins Binary Decimal Line T H T T 0100 4 | ~~\-------~~ T H T H 0101 5 | ~~\-------~~ T H H T 0110 6 | ~~\-------~~ T H H H 0111 7 | ~~\-------~~ Coins Binary Decimal Line H T T T 1000 8 | ~~\-------~~ H T T H 1001 9 | ~~\---~~ ~~\---~~ H T H T 1010 10 | ~~\---~~ ~~\---~~ H T H H 1011 11 | ~~\---~~ ~~\---~~ Coins Binary Decimal Line H H T T 1100 12 | ~~\---~~ ~~\---~~ H H T H 1101 13 | ~~\---~~ ~~\---~~ H H H T 1110 14 | ~~\---~~ ~~\---~~ H H H H 1111 15 | ~~\---~~ ~~\---~~ The two-coin method described above can be performed with four coins, simply by having one pair of coins be alike—of the same size or denomination—while the other two are of a different size or denomination; the larger coins can then be counted as the first toss, while the two smaller coins constitute the second toss (or vice versa). ==== Six coins ==== Six coins—five identical coins and one different—can be thrown at once. The coin that lands closest to a line drawn on the table will make the first line of the hexagram, and so on: heads for yang, tails for yin. The distinct coin is a moving line. This method has the dual failings that (1) it forces every hexagram to be a changing hexagram, and (2) it only ever allows exactly one line to be changing. ==== Eight coins on Ba Qian ==== Eight coins, one marked, are tossed at once. They are picked up in order and placed onto a Bagua diagram; the marked coin rests on the lower trigram. The eight process is repeated for the upper trigram. After a third toss, the first six coins are placed on the hexagram to mark a moving line. This has the deficiency or allowing at most one moving line, whereas all six lines could be moving in traditional methods. === Dice === Any dice with an even number of faces can also be used in the same fashion as the coin tosses, with even die rolls for heads and odd for tails. An eight-sided die (d8) can be used to simulate the chances of a line being an old moving line equivalent to the yarrow-stalk method. For example, because the chances of any yin line or any yang line are equal in the yarrow-stalk method, there is a one-in-eight chance of getting any basic trigram, the same chance held under the ba qian method, so the ba qian method can be used to determine the basic hexagram. The d8 can then be used by rolling it once for each line to determine moving lines. A result of 1 on a yin line, or 3 or less on a yang line, will make that line a moving line, preserving the yarrow-stalk method's outcomes. Another dice method that produces the 1:7:3:5 ratio of the yarrow-stalk method is to add 1d4 + 1d8. All odd results are considered yin, with the result of 11 denoting an old yin. Any even results would be considered yang, with both 4 and 10 treated as old yang. Two dice methods that not only produce the yarrow-stalk probabilities but maintain the traditional even–odd associations of yin and yang are the 3d4 and 2d8 methods. In the 3d4 method, one rolls three four- sided dice and adds their outcomes, treating all odd totals as yang and all even totals as yin, with totals of 4, 7, and 12 indicating a moving line. The 2d8 method works analogously for two eight-sided dice, but here, any total over 10 (with the exception of 12) is considered moving. === Calendric cycles and astrology === There is a tradition of Taoist thought which explores numerology, esoteric cosmology, astrology and feng shui in connection with the I Ching. The eleventh-century Neo-Confucian philosopher Shao Yung contributed advanced methods of divination including the Plum Blossom Yi Numerology, a horary astrology that takes into account the number of calligraphic brush strokes of one's query. Following the associations Carl Jung drew between astrology and I Ching with the introduction of his theory of synchronicity, the authors of modern Yi studies are much informed by the astrological paradigm. Chu and Sherrill provide five astrological systems in An Anthology of I Ching and in The Astrology of I Ching develop a form of symbolic astrology that uses the eight trigrams in connection with the time of one's birth to generate an oracle from which further hexagrams and a daily line judgement are derived. Another modern development incorporates the planetary positions of one's natal horoscope against the backdrop of Shao Yung's circular Fu Xi arrangement and the Western zodiac to provide multiple hexagrams corresponding to each of the planets. === Wen Wang Gua method === This method goes back to Jing Fang (78–37 BC). While a hexagram is derived with one of the common methods like coin or yarrow stalks, here the divination is not interpreted on the basis of the classic I Ching text. Instead, this system connects each of the six hexagram lines to one of the Twelve Earthly Branches, and then the picture can be analyzed with the use of 5 Elements (Wu Xing).Wen Wang Gua , Joseph Yu By bringing in the Chinese calendar, this method not only tries to determine what will happen, but also when it will happen. As such, Wen Wang Gua makes a bridge between I Ching and the Four Pillars of Destiny. === Software methods === The preceding ("concrete"/physical) methods can be simulated in ("abstract"/conceptual) software. This has the theoretical advantage of improving randomness aspects of consulting the I Ching ("not-doing" in the personal sense, enhancing the "universal" principle). For all methods, one must pre-focus/prepare the mind. Here is a typical example for the "modified three-coin" method: #!/usr/bin/env python3 # # iChing_Modified_3_coins.py # # see https://github.com/kwccoin/I-Ching-Modified-3-Coin-Method # # Create (two) I Ching hexagrams: present > future (might be same). # # With both "3-coin method" and "modified 3-coin method" (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching_divination). # # 3-coins Probabilities: # old/changing/moving yin "6 : == x ==" = 1/8 # (young/stable/static) yang "7 : =======" = 3/8 # (young/stable/static) yin "8 : == ==" = 3/8 # old/changing/moving yang "9 : == o ==" = 1/8 # # 3-coins Probabilities: # old/changing/moving yin "6 : === x ===" = 1/8 # (young/stable/static) yang "7 : =========" = 3/8 # (young/stable/static) yin "8 : === ===" = 3/8 # old/changing/moving yang "9 : ====o====" = 1/8 # # Modified 3-coins Probabilities: # old/changing/moving yin "6 : === x ===" = 1/8 * 1/2 = 1/16 # (young/stable/static) yang "7 : =========" = 3/8 - 1/8*1/2 = 5/16 # (young/stable/static) yin "8 : === ===" = 3/8 - P[6] = 7/16 # old/changing/moving yang "9 : ====o====" = 1/8 - p[7] = 3/16 # see # https://aleadeum.com/2013/07/12/the-i-ching-random-numbers-and-why-you-are- doing-it-wrong/ # especially see the remark why 1st round are 1/4-3/4 whilst 2nd and 3rd round are 1/2-1/2 import random def toss(method: str = "yarrow") -> int: """Toss.""" rng = random.SystemRandom() # Auto-seeded, with os.urandom() special_coin = 0 val = 0 for flip in range(3): # Three simulated coin flips i.e. coin 0, 1, 2 val += rng.randint(2, 3) # tail=2, head=3 for each coin if flip == 0: special_coin = val # Coin 0 as the special coin if method == "coin": # Coin method note tth or 223 is 7 or young yang return val # Probability of 6/7/8/9 is 1/8 3/8 3/8 1/8 elif method == "modified 3 coins": # method similar to "yarrow-stick" need to have prob. # for 6/7/8/9 as 1/16 5/16 7/16 3/16 # now coin method is # for 6/7/8/9 as 2/16 6/16 6/16 2/16 # modified to change # -1/16 -1/16 +1/16 + 1/16 # 6 7 8 9 if (val == 6) and (special_coin == 2): special_coin = rng.randint(2, 3) if special_coin == 2: val = 6 else: val = 8 elif (val == 7) and (special_coin == 3): special_coin = rng.randint(2, 3) if (special_coin == 3): val = 7 else: val = 9 return val # probability of 6/7/8/9 is 1/16 5/16 7/16 3/16 else: # yarrow-stick method as effectively default # start_sticks, sky-left, sky-reminder, human, earth- right, earth-reminder, bin # value-> 49 0 0 0 0 0 0 # index-> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 # on table: # heaven # heaven-left human earth-right # earth # # sometimes use finger to hold above def printys(ys, remark): # String format example: f"Result: {value:{width}.{precision}}" width = 3 print(f'[{ys[0]}, 	{ys[1]}, 	{ys[2]}, 	{ys[3]}, 	{ys[4]}, 	{ys[5]}, 	{ys[6]}] 	{remark}') return def ys_round(ys, round, debug="no"): if debug == "yes": print("Round is", round) if debug == "yes": print("===============") if debug == "yes": print(f'[{"src"}, 	{"sky"}, 	{"left"}, 	{"human"}, 	{"earth"}, 	{"right"}, 	{"bin"}] 	{"remark"}') # Generate a number somewhere in between 1/3 to 2/3 as human do not trick if debug == "yes": printys(ys, "Starting") ys[1] = rng.randint(ys[0] // 3, ys[0] * 2 // 3) ys[4] = ys[0] - ys[1] ys[0] = ys[0] - ys[1] - ys[4] if debug == "yes": printys(ys, "Separate into two") ys[3] = 1 ys[1] = ys[1] - ys[3] if debug == "yes": printys(ys, "and with one as human") ys[2] = ys[1] % 4 if ys[2] == 0: ys[2] = 4 ys[1] = ys[1] - ys[2] if debug == "yes": printys(ys, "then 4 by 4 and sky behind ...") ys[5] = ys[4] % 4 if ys[5] == 0: ys[5] = 4 ys[4] = ys[4] - ys[5] if debug == "yes": printys(ys, "then 4 by 4 and earth behind ...") ys[6] += ys[2] + ys[3] + ys[5] ys[2] = 0 ys[3] = 0 ys[5] = 0 ys[0] = ys[1] + ys[4] ys[1] = 0 ys[4] = 0 if debug == "yes": printys(ys, "complete the cycle ...") return ys ys = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # May be better use dictionary ys[0] = 55 # printys(ys, "The number of heaven and earth is 55") ys[0] = 49 # printys(ys, "only 49 is used") # Round 1 need to ensure mod 4 cannot return 0 and cannot have 0 # wiki said cannot have 1 as well not sure about that ys = ys_round(ys, 1, "no") # "yes") ys = ys_round(ys, 2, "no") # "yes") ys = ys_round(ys, 3, "no") # "yes") return ys[0] // 4 # We build in bottom to top print("Method is yarrow by default ") toss_array = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] for line in range(0, 6, 1): toss_array[line] = toss() print("Line is ", line + 1, ";

(Also, the first number starts from the bottom like a hexagram.) A JavaScript version of the Yarrow Stalk method, which generates slightly different probabilities, is available in open source form at GitHub. == Probability analysis of I Ching divination == Most analyses of the probabilities of either the coin method or yarrow-stalk method agree on the probabilities for each method. The coin method varies significantly from the yarrow-stalk method, in that the former gives the same probability to both of the moving lines and to both of the static lines, which is not the case in the yarrow-stalk method. However, the calculation of the frequencies for the yarrow-stalk method—generally believed to be the same as those described in this article in the simplified method using sixteen objects—contains a further error, in the opinion of Andrew Kennedy,Kennedy, Andrew, Briefing Leaders, Gravity Publishing, UK, 2006, which is that of including the selection of zero as a quantity for either hand. The yarrow-stalk procedure expressly requires that the four numbers be produced without using zero; Kennedy shows that by not allowing the user to select zero for either hand, or a single stalk for the right hand (this stalk is moved to the left hand before counting by fours, and so also leaves a zero in the right hand), the hexagram frequencies change significantly for a daily user of the oracle. Kennedy has modified the simplified method of using sixteen coloured objects described in this article as follows: This arrangement produces Kennedy's calculated frequencies within 0.1%. ==In popular culture== * In Profiler Season 1, Episode 3: "Holy Alliance" (1996), a serial killer uses I Ching, and the hexagram determines what and how someone is chosen and killed. * In the Mad Men season 6 episode, "Crash", Frank Gleason's flower child daughter, Wendy, uses the three-coin method to tell fortunes at the offices of the newly merged firm. * In The Man In the High Castle by Philip K.

I Am America (And So Can You!) is a 2007 satirical book by American comedian Stephen Colbert and the writers of The Colbert Report. It was released on October 9, 2007, with the audiobook edition released several days earlier. The book is loosely structured around the fictional life story of Stephen Colbert as he appears on The Colbert Report. , the book had been on the New York Times Bestseller List in the Hardcover Nonfiction category for twenty-four weeks, ranking number one for fourteen of them. ==Description== I Am America (And So Can You!) is described as being a "pure extension" of The Colbert Report, delving into the views of Colbert's "well-intentioned, poorly informed high status idiot" character on what he considers to be the most pressing issues facing America. The book is influenced by the literary endeavors of the character's pundit models, such as Bill O'Reilly's book, The O'Reilly Factor (2000) and Sean Hannity's Deliver Us From Evil (2004), which Colbert says he forced himself to read as a reference.Colbert, Stephen (October 16, 2007). "Meet the Author" podcast. Retrieved on October 27, 2007. Red margin notes appear throughout the book, providing humorous reactions and counterpoints to Colbert's arguments in a style comparable to the Reports "The Wørd" segment. The cover features a sticker depicting a burning book, declaring I Am America to be a nominee for "The Stephen T. Colbert Award for the Literary Excellence". A sheet of twelve similar stickers are provided inside, with which readers are provided to nominate other books for the award. A second sheet of stickers containing positive expressions such as "Hell Yeah!", "Nailed It!" and "It's Morning In Colbert-ica" is included for readers as bookmarks to remind them "when you agreed with me most."Colbert, Stephen (2007). I Am America (And So Can You!). New York: Grand Central Publishing. Colbert, whose character frequently used his show to advertise his own satirical products, frequently promoted I Am America at the time of its release, including in a commercial which depicted the book emerging from an erupting volcano in a manner similar to commercials for Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. On October 9, 2007, the day of the book's release, Colbert interviewed himself as the show's featured guest.

11100016	I Am (poem)	"I Am" (or "Lines: I Am") is a poem written by English poet John Clare in late 1844 or 1845 and published in 1848. It was composed when Clare was in the Northampton General Lunatic Asylum Materials for the author's thesis. (commonly Northampton County Asylum, and later renamed St Andrew's Hospital), isolated by his mental illness from his family and friends. ==Background and structure== This poem, written in three stanzas of regular iambic pentameter and an "ababab" rhyme scheme in the first stanza and an "cdcdee" scheme for the second stanza and an"fgfghh" for the third stanza, details Clare's finding of a sanctuary from the travails of his life in the asylum by reasserting his individuality in life and love of the beauty of the natural world in which he will find peace in death. An irony of Clare writing a poem declaring "I am" is that at times during his years in asylums he believed he was Lord Byron and Shakespeare, even re-editing Byron's poems at one point. The second stanza examines the alienation he feels from his family and friends due to his mental condition "And e'en the dearest - that I loved the best - / Are strange - nay, rather stranger than the rest". The final stanza adopts religious imagery, calling on God, recalling the garden of Eden and longing for the "vaulted sky", a reference to a cathedral-like heaven. It appears to both hope for a spiritual afterlife and accept the physical reality of peaceful repose in his beloved earth. The house steward of the asylum, W. F. Knight, who worked there from April 1845 to the end of January 1850, transcribed the poem for Clare. The poem was first published on 1 January 1848 in the Bedford Times, or per other sources in the Annual Report of the Medical Superintendent of Saint Andrews for 1864, and later appeared with slightly altered text in Life of John Clare, the biography of the poet by Frederick Martin. The poem is known as Clare's "last lines" and is his most famous. The poem's title is used for a 2003 collection of Clare's poetry, I Am: The Selected Poetry of John Clare, edited by his biographer Jonathan Bate, and it had previously been included in the 1992 Columbia University Press anthology, The Top 500 Poems. The poem is not to be confused with a sonnet also written by Clare and also entitled "I Am" (or "I Only Know I Am", or "Sonnet: I Am"). The latter may, however, "be seen as a complementary piece". == References == == External links == * 1998 reading of poem by Robert Pinsky, then U.S. Poet Laureate - Slate.com * "John Clare - I Am, published 1848 (written c.1840)", BBC reading * Project Gutenberg version of Poems Chiefly from Manuscript by John Clare includes "I Am" Category:1848 poems Category:English poems
11173592	I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real	I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real. is an album released by YACHT on Marriage Records in 2007. To promote the album, frontman Jona Bechtolt performed a live show on a yacht. ==Background== While he recorded I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real., Jona Bechtolt was also working with Khaela Maricich in the band The Blow. I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real. is his third solo album. The album is the first by YACHT to feature appearances from musician Claire L. Evans, who would become a full member of the band following its release. The album was recorded between 2004 and 2006. ==Style== In general, the album is underscored with themes of positivity and magic. One exception to this trend is "It's Coming to Get You", which, according to Bechtolt, was inspired by a negative personal experience. That song explores karma; Bechtolt has stated that he "wanted to focus on it being okay for bad things to happen to people if those are things that are coming back and biting them in the ass". He sang the lyrics over upbeat "dance" instrumentation to make the track more accessible. ==Reception== I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real. received mixed reviews from critics. In a review for Allmusic, Jason Lymangrover discusses the distinction between the album and Jona Bechtolt's primary project at the time, The Blow. Lymangrover added that the unprofessional vocals gave the album an endearing whimsical nature, while sparse arrangements provided an experimental background. Lymangrover deemed the album an interesting side project, but not distinct enough from The Blow's work to be outstanding. Rob Mitchum, reviewing for Pitchfork Media, called the album a step forward from Bechtolt's previous solo albums. He praised the album's charisma and childishness. Mitchum concluded that "YACHT may not be the innovative and distinctive force that Max Tundra proved himself to be, but as a willing disciple, he's wise enough to harvest in Tundra's fertile territory". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;YACHT *Jona Bechtolt – songwriting, vocals, guitar, bass guitar, drums, percussion, synthesizers ;Additional musicians *Bobby Birdman – additional songwriting, vocals *Ivor Cutler – songwriting (track 12) *Eats Tapes – drum machine *Claire Evans – vocals *Adam Forkner – additional bass *Steve Schroeder – additional vocals *David Shrigley – additional songwriting ;Production *Jona Bechtolt – producer, art director ==References== ==External links== * Category:Yacht (band) albums Category:2007 albums Category:Marriage Records albums

1124950	I Can't Stand Still	I Can't Stand Still is the debut solo studio album by American musician Don Henley, drummer and co-lead vocalist for the Eagles. It was released in August 1982 by Asylum Records. Henley, Danny Kortchmar and Greg Ladanyi produced the album. I Can't Stand Still achieved gold status, and peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard 200 and at the same position on the UK Albums Chart. Three singles were released from the album, including the hit "Dirty Laundry", which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Henley's best-selling single. The title track "I Can't Stand Still" reached No. 48 and the track "Johnny Can't Read" reached No. 42 on the charts. The album showcased some of Henley's frustrations at the time. "Dirty Laundry" displays his disgust with the media and tabloid news coverage, and "Johnny Can't Read," shows his displeasure with the American educational system. ==Critical reception== Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times, was surprised by I Can't Stand Still and wrote that it "rings with the righteous indignation of a man who has taken a good look at what's going on around him and decided at least to speak his mind about it...The record doesn't offer any solutions, but how many pop records do? I Can't Stand Still scores points for its palpable anger; for its lean, stripped-down arrangements; for the lack of self-indulgence in the playing, the production and Mr. Henley's soaring vocals, and for its overall point of view, which links the disparate songs together and gives the album an admirable coherence. As far as this listener is concerned, it's better than anything Mr. Henley did with the Eagles." Reviewing retrospectively for AllMusic, critic Mike DeGagne has written of the album, "Henley's first solo album may still have had the ghost of the Eagles lingering in the corners, but for the most part it showcases his stalwart partnership with producer and songwriter Danny Kortchmar," and then added "Henley's adept combination of lyrical wit and thought-provoking staidness begins to materialize on I Can't Stand Still, paving the way for an extremely accomplished solo career." Cash Box said of the title track that "using the same organ that made “Laundry” so unique, Henley weaves the chords through a ballad about a guy’s bitterness over his lost love’s new find." Cash Box also said that it's "a slow, dramatic, organ-dominated tune that’s almost, but not quite, reggae" and that Henley's vocal tingles with a jealous edge as he sings of his lover’s 'undercover' relationship." Billboard called it "reggae California style, using heavy bass and syncopated organ for the rhythm track." AllMusic critic Mike DeGagne called it "a trouble-in-paradise love song, [that] has Henley pouring his heart out with sugary angst, but is helped along with some avid keyboard work." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Musicians * Don Henley – lead vocals, harmony vocals (1), drums (1, 2, 8, 10), backing vocals (3, 6), arrangements (11) * Danny Kortchmar – keyboards (1), guitars (1), electric guitar (2, 4, 5, 8, 10), baritone guitar (3, 7, 11), rhythm guitar (6), backing vocals (6), arrangements (11) * Benmont Tench – keyboards (3, 4, 5, 11), acoustic piano (5, 10) * Garth Hudson – synthesizers (5) * Steve Porcaro – synthesizers (5), keyboards (6), special keyboard effects (6) * Roger Linn – special effects (6) * Andrew Gold – keyboards (7) * Steve Lukather – electric guitar (2), acoustic guitar (5), 2nd guitar solo (6) * Waddy Wachtel – electric guitar (4, 11), slide guitar (10) * Joe Walsh – 1st guitar solo (6) * Bob Glaub – bass (1, 2, 7, 11) * Leland Sklar – bass (3, 10) * Kenny Edwards – bass (5, 8), electric guitar (7) * Jeff Porcaro – drums (2, 3, 5, 6), maracas (2) * Russ Kunkel – drums (4) * Mark Towner Williams – drums (7) * Ian Wallace – drums (11) * Steve Forman – percussion (3) * Ras Baboo – percussion (11), timbales (11) * Derek Bell – harp (9) * Paddy Moloney – tin whistle (9), original arrangements (9), Uilleann pipes (10) * Timothy B.

1132431	I Am Spock	I Am Spock is the second volume of actor and director Leonard Nimoy's autobiography. The book was published in 1995, four years after the release of the last Star Trek motion picture starring the entire original cast, and covers the majority of Nimoy's time with Star Trek in general and Mr. Spock in particular. The book's title was a reference to the first volume of his autobiography, I Am Not Spock, which had been published in 1975. At that time, Nimoy had sought to distance his own personality from that of the character of Spock, although he nonetheless remained proud of his time on the show. Negative fan reaction to the title gave Nimoy the idea for the title of the second volume. ==Synopsis== In his second autobiography, Nimoy explains that the title of the first book had been his idea, over the objections of his publishers. He had not anticipated the problem of people reading the title without reading the book. In reality, his feelings toward Spock had not changed at all in the intervening years. On the contrary, Nimoy explains in this book that Spock has always been a part of him. This duality is explored and taken to extremes throughout the book. Indeed, the book's foreword is written by Mr. Spock himself, in the form of a letter the Vulcan writes to Leonard Nimoy, to express confusion over the highly illogical title. Throughout the book, Nimoy frequently has conversations with his other half, as he explores the choices and decisions he has made throughout his life, and how those choices have been affected by a certain calm logical voice in the back of his mind. While the focus of the book is on Nimoy's Star Trek career, he also takes time to explore his other works, including directing and theatre acting. Memorable stories include his being forced to tell an actress she needed to redo a highly emotional scene because of a crew member's mistake, and how directing Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home led to Hollywood giving him a shot at directing Three Men and a Baby (1987), which went on to be the highest-grossing film in the United States of that year.Box Office Mojo: 1987 Yearly Box Office Results He also mentions his work producing and directing the UPN television series Deadly Games. On the topic of Spock's future, Nimoy notes that the Star Trek franchise shows no sign of dying, and that as far as he is concerned, Spock is still alive and well working on Romulus. ==Reception== Anita Gates of The New York Times praised his "pleasant, conversational writing style" and said "his affection for the Spock experience rings very true". Publishers Weekly wrote: "Nimoy's admirers may find this fairly impersonal memoir disappointing; it touches only tangentially on the author's private life. But this is an intelligent and entertaining look at an actor's engagement with a character who "seemed to take on an existence of his own."" ==References== ==External links== Category:1995 books Category:Show business memoirs Category:Books by Leonard Nimoy Category:Books about Star Trek Category:Hyperion Books books

11419475	I Am a Photograph	I Am a Photograph is the debut studio album by French singer Amanda Lear, released in 1977 by West German label Ariola Records. The album was a success on the European market and spawned Lear's first disco hit singles "Blood and Honey", "Tomorrow" and "Queen of Chinatown", the latter available only on the album's re-issue. I Am a Photograph was officially re-released on CD in 2012. ==Background== Amanda Lear's first album, called I Am a Photograph in reference to her former modelling career, was recorded in Munich with a German producer Anthony Monn, and consisted of mainstream disco material, with majority of lyrics written by Amanda Lear herself. In addition to original songs composed by Anthony Monn and Rainer Pietsch, the album included a number of covers: Nancy Sinatra's "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'", "Blue Tango", paired with Lear's self-penned lyrics and a French-language version of Elvis Presley's "Trouble". In addition, "Alphabet" largely incorporated excerpts from Johann Sebastian Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier. The artwork is credited to Ariola-Eurodisc Studios. The front cover of the first pressing pictures a photograph of Amanda Lear taken from the Bravo magazine and stuck on a wooden garage door, between various photographs of motorcycles, a mirror, a crucifix as well as the American, Swedish and Dutch flags. The second pressing featured a cropped nude picture of Amanda Lear, taken by Christa Peters for the Playboy magazine. German editions came with the full-size poster of the topless cover picture. French and Italian pressings of the album used an alternative photograph from the Playboy shoot on the cover. The cover of Presley's "Trouble" was released as Lear's debut single in 1975. The French-language version of the song, "La Bagarre", met with a modest success in Germany in 1976, followed by "Blood and Honey" later the same year, which met with a major commercial success and was an international breakthrough for Lear in 1977. "Tomorrow" subsequently became a number 1 single in Italy and a trademark hit. "Blue Tango" and "Alphabet" were released in certain territories, but did not chart. Later in 1977, "Queen of Chinatown" was released as a single from the second edition of the album, becoming a hit in Europe and Lear's greatest chart success up to that point. The album's promotional campaign was based on Amanda's "scandalous sex-symbol personality", surrounded by gossips regarding her alleged transsexualism, place of birth, which at the time was believed to be Transylvania, and her relationships with Salvador Dalí and David Bowie. A small concert tour was also arranged in Italy. It became a commercial success in Europe, especially in Italy, where it reached top 10. I Am a Photograph was re-issued with alternative track listings and covers. The second West German pressing replaced "La Bagarre" with "She's Got the Devil in Her Eyes", which was an instrumental version of "Blood and Honey". On the following edition, "La Bagarre" was omitted in favour of the new recording, "Queen of Chinatown". American edition included an extended version of "Blood and Honey" while the 1978 East German release featured "Mother, Look What They've Done to Me", a Sweet Revenge album track. The album was released as Tomorrow in Brazil, yet again with re-arranged track listing, and as Pretty Boys in Zimbabwe and South Africa. In Argentina, the album was distributed as Soy una fotografía in 1979. The official CD re-release did not take place until 2012, when Gold Legion released the album in three different versions of the front cover, including the original topless poster in chosen editions. All three editions retained the track listing of the original LP release, adding four bonus tracks, including "Queen of Chinatown". The material has been remastered from original master tapes. In August 2014, the album was officially released on digital music platforms. The 1978 Billboard review praised the album's "catchy" melodies and lyrics, and described Amanda's vocal delivery as "unique" and "intriguing". Contemporary music critic Michael Freedberg gave I Am a Photograph a four-star rating on AllMusic, praising its arrangements and calling it "an album not to be missed". However, John C. Hughes of Popdose.com referred to the album as "nearly unlistenable", critically reflecting on Amanda's vocal performance. ==Commercial performance== In 1978 Amanda Lear received a gold disc for cumulatives sales of one million units in Italy of singles "Tomorrow" and "Queen of China Town" and the album "I am a Photograph". ==Track listing== ===Original release=== ;Side A # "Blood and Honey" (Anthony Monn, Amanda Lear) – 4:50 # "Alphabet (Prelude in C by J.

11469434	I Can't Sleep (film)	I Can't Sleep () is a 1994 French drama film written and directed by Claire Denis. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. The film was loosely inspired by the murders committed by Thierry Paulin. ==Plot== Daiga (Yekaterina Golubeva), a woman from Lithuania, immigrates to Paris with little money but hopes to secure herself a job as an actor. When her plans fall through, she begins work as a maid in the hotel of a friend of her great-aunt. At the same time Theo (Alex Descas) is embroiled in a fight with his wife, as he wants to leave for Martinique with their young son while she wants to remain in Paris. He is infrequently visited by his brother, Camille. Meanwhile, the city is on edge because of a series of violent murders that have targeted elderly women living alone. The murders are being committed by Camille and his lover. The two live in the hotel run by Daiga's employer. Eventually Daiga begins to follow Camille around. She figures out that he is the murderer after spotting a police sketch of his face. After breaking into his room, she finds a bag of cash and steals it, leaving abruptly to go back to Lithuania. Camille is spotted by police after one of his victims recovers enough to give a description of him. Theo is brought to the police station for questioning but insists that, far from having anything to do with the murders, he remained unaware of what his brother was doing the entire time. ==Cast== * Yekaterina Golubeva as Daiga * Richard Courcet as Camille * Vincent Dupont as Raphael * Laurent Grévill as le docteur * Alex Descas as Theo * Irina Grjebina as Mina * Tolsty as Vasily * Line Renaud as Ninon * Béatrice Dalle as Mona * Sophie Simon as Alice * Patrick Grandperret as Abel * Didier Flamand as The Detective == Reception == The film received generally positive reviews from critics, garnering a 75% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1994 films Category:1994 drama films Category:1990s French-language films Category:Films directed by Claire Denis Category:Transgender-related films Category:Films set in Paris Category:French drama films Category:1990s French films
11722257	I Can Has Cheezburger	thumb|upright|An example of an image that was posted on ICHC I Can Has Cheezburger? (abbreviated as ICHC) is a blog-format website featuring videos (usually involving animals) and image macros. It was created in 2007 by Eric Nakagawa (Cheezburger), from Hawaii, and his friend Kari Unebasami (Tofuburger). The website was one of the most popular Internet sites of its kind receiving as many as 1,500,000 hits per day at its peak in May 2007. ICHC was instrumental in bringing animal-based image macros and lolspeak into mainstream usage and making Internet memes profitable. ICHC was created on January 11, 2007, when Nakagawa posted an image from comedy website Something Awful of a smiling British Shorthair cat, known as Happycat, with a caption of the animal asking, "I can has cheezburger?" in a style popularised by 4chan. It is from this image that the site derives its name. After posting similar images, Nakagawa then converted the site to a monetized blog. A group of investors acquired the website in September 2007 for US$2 million. The blog became the flagship site of the Cheezburger Network, led by Ben Huh. The network also includes FAIL Blog and Know Your Meme. In 2016 the network was acquired by Literally Media. == Content == ICHC's content is submitted by the site's readers, and the site hosts "the LOL Builder", an image macro creation tool. The number of submissions has risen dramatically with the growth of the site. In July 2007, ICHC received as many as 500 submissions per day. By January 2008, the average was 8000. Only about a dozen or so submissions per day are posted to the website, while updates are timed to coincide with when readers are most likely to be visiting the site – morning, lunchtime and evenings. , ICHC gets about 2 million page views per day. The site attempts to maintain a community feel, encouraging interactivity with readers via a voting system where users can rate an image from one to five "cheezburgers", and through themes as one image will attract responses to form a continuous narrative. According to Nakagawa, "It's like you're creating a story supplied by people in the community, and then the people in the community supply the next part of the story." Until 2013, ICHC also ran a wiki at SpeakLolSpeak.com designed to be a collection of important lolspeak phrases. Popular trends on the ICHC website for captioning have included "ceiling cat" (usually a white cat); "basement cat" (a black cat); the "itteh bitteh kitteh committeh"; invisible [something]; the Lolrus and his "bukkit"; fail (now moved to FAIL Blog); "om nom nom" (as in eating sounds); references to "cheezburgers"; "happy caturday"; "monorail kitteh"; "oh hai"; and "kthxbai" ("OK, thanks, goodbye"). ICHC has popularized snowclones such as "I'm in your (noun), (verb ending in ing) your (noun)"; " [some activity or emotion], ur doin it right/wrong"; and "I gave/brought you [something] but I eated it/uzed it all up". ==Fonts== The typeface Impact is used in almost every picture on all the I Can Has Cheezburger websites (though not as much on its subsidiary websites, such as Memebase), and has even gone as far as to be attempted to be replicated in an oil painting representation of the original "Happy cat" (the original lolcat to say "I Can Has Cheezburger?") on the ICHC website. This use of the font stems from it being the font of choice in Something Awful image macros for manyWhatport80.com, History and design of image macros hence it is the default font in the site's Lolcat Builder. Many people creating lolcats in other software have used the same font to retain the classic I Can Has Cheezburger look. Other standard fonts are available on the builder. ==Spin- off projects and publications== A network of related sister sites has developed alongside ICHC, called the Cheezburger Network. 25 of these are linked to each other via a navigation bar at the top of each site. LOLwork on Bravo chronicled employees lives at the ICHC office. ICHC produced a book, I Can Has Cheezburger?: A LOLcat Colleckshun, in 2008. A second ICHC book, How To Take Over The Wurld: An LOLcat Guide 2 Winning, was published in 2009. Also, FAIL Blog released its first book, Fail Nation: A Visual Romp Through the World of Epic Fails, on October 6, 2009. Cheezburger was the subject of the LOLwork reality television series on the Bravo television network. The series followed Ben Huh and his staff as they created new content for the site. #ICanHazPDF, derived from I Can Has Cheezburger?, is a hashtag used on Twitter by researchers seeking academic papers for free to get around academic journals' paywalls. ==See also== * Pet Holdings – the company that originally owned the Cheezburger Network * Fail Blog * Failbook * Know Your Meme * List of Internet phenomena * Texts From Last Night ==References== ==External links== * Category:American comedy websites Category:Internet humor Category:Internet properties established in 2007 Category:Internet memes Category:Companies based in Seattle Category:Animal websites
1184662	I Am Charlotte Simmons	{{Infobox book | name = I am Charlotte Simmons | image = Iamcharlottesimmons.jpg | border = yes | caption = First edition cover | alt = | author = Tom Wolfe | country = United States | language = English | subject = | genre = Fiction | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | pub_date = | media_type = Print (Hardback & Paperback) | pages = 752 | awards = | isbn = 0-312-42444-2 | oclc = | dewey = | congress = }} I Am Charlotte Simmons is a 2004 novel by Tom Wolfe, concerning sexual and status relationships at the fictional Dupont University. Wolfe researched the novel by talking to students at North Carolina, Florida, Penn, Duke, Stanford, and Michigan. Wolfe suggested it depicts the American university today at a fictional college that is "Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Duke, and a few other places all rolled into one." ==Plot== I Am Charlotte Simmons is the story of college student Charlotte Simmons's first semester-and-a-half at the prestigious Dupont University. A high school graduate from a poverty-stricken rural town, her intelligence and hard work at school have been rewarded with a full scholarship to Dupont. As Charlotte prepares to say goodbye to her family and leave for college, an event happens at Dupont that will play an important role in her future. Hoyt Thorpe, member of the exclusive and powerful fraternity Saint Ray, and fellow frat brother Vance, stumble upon an unnamed California Republican governor (who was at the college to speak at the school's commencement ceremony) receiving oral sex from a female college student. When the governor's bodyguard spots the two fraternity members, a fight ensues with Hoyt and Vance beating up the bodyguard and fleeing. The story of the night soon spreads across campus, increasing Hoyt's popularity. Charlotte arrives at Dupont in the fall. Her roommate is wealthy Beverly, the daughter of the CEO of a huge multinational insurance company. She is obsessed with sex, in particular with members of the school's lacrosse team. Jojo Johanssen is a white athlete on the college's predominantly black basketball team. He is struggling to keep his position because the school recently recruited an up- and-coming black freshman player, and the coach wants to bench Jojo in his senior year. This would severely hurt Jojo's chances of playing in "the league" (the NBA). Jojo enjoys the spoils of being a college athlete, such as using a tutor program to force other students to complete his school assignments. Jojo's "tutor" Adam Gellin is, like Charlotte, from a working- class background. Adam writes for the college's independent newspaper and is a member of the "Millennial Mutants," a group of like-minded intellectuals who oppose the anti-intellectualism and class snobbery they see in their fellow students. Charlotte and Adam first meet at the university's computer lab, where Adam is to write a paper for Jojo. Charlotte does not back down when Adam insists that he needs the computer more than she does. Adam is instantly smitten. Charlotte finds herself dealing with the sexual temptations of college life, culminating in her hooking up with Hoyt, who tells Charlotte of catching California's governor receiving oral sex from a college student. He also tells Charlotte he knows that Adam Gellin has begun investigating the incident and how, at the behest of the governor a large Wall Street firm has offered Hoyt a high-paying entry-level job in exchange for his silence. (The firm, Pierce & Pierce, is the name of the one that Sherman McCoy works for in Wolfe's earlier novel, The Bonfire of the Vanities.) Hoyt and Charlotte attend an important fraternity formal together, after which Hoyt takes full advantage of a drunken Charlotte, seducing her into giving up her virginity to him. The following morning, Charlotte is dumped by Hoyt. She is further humiliated when she returns to campus and discovers that Hoyt's seduction and rejection has been made public via two girls Charlotte had previously befriended. The two cruelly mock Charlotte, both over her poverty-stricken background, and for how she drunkenly lost her virginity. This drives Charlotte into a depression and eventually into the arms of Adam, who has wanted Charlotte for her beauty, innocence, and intellect since they first met. Charlotte finally emerges from her depression but finds that she has received terrible grades (B, B−, C−, D) for her first semester at Dupont. As Adam prepares to publish his article, his world collides with Jojo Johanssen's when a paper that Adam wrote for the athlete is accused of being plagiarized. Jojo, who treats Adam as beneath him socially, denies the plagiarism charge and protects the athletic department's perversion of the athlete/tutor program from being exposed. Jojo has begun to transform himself academically from a stereotypical "dumb jock" into a student who takes his academics seriously and even develops an interest in philosophy (partly as a result of Charlotte's influence). Jerome Quat, Jojo's professor, confronts Adam about the plagiarized paper and shows sympathy toward him in a college dominated by students obsessed with sports and sex. However, when Adam confesses to having written the paper for Jojo, the professor double-crosses him. He will sacrifice Adam in order to bring down the basketball program, which has circled the wagons to protect Jojo. This devastates Adam, who breaks down and needs Charlotte to take care of him as he waits to be formally charged with cheating. In the meantime, Adam's article on "The Night of the Skullfuck" is published. The sordid details of sex, violence, bribery, and a high-profile political figure cause it to be picked up by the national media. The governor's Presidential ambitions are potentially ruined, and the job offer/bribe made to Hoyt is revoked, effectively shattering Hoyt's life. Hoyt now faces a post-graduation judgment day, with his family's life savings exhausted in order to pay for his college education, and a college transcript with such bad grades that will effectively keep him from getting a job as an investment banker. Jojo's and Adam's necks are saved, as the liberal college professor decides to drop the entire plagiarism complaint so as to avoid undercutting Adam's credibility in destroying the conservative governor's political career. Adam's self-esteem restored, he begins to bask in the glow as the student who brought down a governor. Adam and Charlotte drift apart and she begins to date Jojo, who keeps his position as a starter on the team, in fact becoming a far better player due to Charlotte's influence and his decision to cultivate his mind. Charlotte ascends to the envied position of girlfriend of a star athlete. One scene at the end has Charlotte in Jojo's large SUV when 2 of the sorority girls that previously mocked her pull up to say hi to Jojo and see Charlotte in the car and say hi like they are old friends. Later one of them invites Charlotte to join their sorority—when Charlotte says she doesn't have money for that, she hints that something can be worked out. Charlotte now reflects upon her first semester with a different view, looking down at her former friends, who gleefully gossiped about her humiliation, and at Hoyt, who casually threw her away. She no longer feels intellectualism is what is most important to her—rather it is being a person recognized as special, regardless of the reason. ==Major themes== The book develops themes Wolfe introduces in the title essay from his book Hooking Up. The novel centers on Charlotte, a naive new student at Dupont University, a school boasting a top-ranked basketball program and an Ivy League academic reputation. Despite Dupont's elite status, in the minds of its students, sex, alcohol, and social status rule the day. The student culture is focused upon gaining material wealth, physical pleasure, and a well-placed social status; academics are only important insofar as they help achieve these goals. ==Research== Wolfe took the name "Dupont University" from Dupont Hall, one of the halls where classes are held at his alma mater, Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. The school discussed in the book appears to be an amalgamation of several elite universities. Wolfe denies that the book is fully based on Duke, from which his daughter Alexandra graduated in 2002. The fictional "St. Ray's" fraternity is most certainly based upon University of Pennsylvania's St. Anthony Hall, or "St. A's," where Wolfe attended several events researching for the book, "St. A's" being on Penn's Locust Walk, with fictional "St. Ray's" residing on Wolfe's "Ladding Walk." Daily Pennsylvanian The basketball star, Jojo Johanssen, is a jock/celebrity character, derived from colleges like the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Kentucky, Duke, Stanford, Indiana University and the University of Florida, where, in Wolfe's perception, student athletes are treated as superior. At the time of publication, JJ Redick was a prominent white basketball player at Duke University. There is also a reference in the book to a freshman dormitory "Giles", which is an actual freshman dorm at Duke University. Besides college life, athletics, and youth sex culture, another major theme that also began in Hooking Up is Tom Wolfe's interest in neuroscience, specifically the relationship between brain chemistry and free will. Simmons is exposed to questions about inevitability and genetics by her professor Dr. Victor Ransome Starling. (At Washington & Lee James Holt Starling, Ph.D. was a faculty member from 1942 to 1983, a biology professor from 1951 to 1983 and a former head of the Biology Department.) In the context of the book, questions of free will are posed by the characters' various dramas as Charlotte decides whether or not she will adopt the sexual norms of campus life and Johanssen attempts to become a better student and more disciplined person generally. Despite the main characters seemingly confirming the science of inevitability, two side characters (Adam Gellin and Hoyt) are both altered considerably by a chance encounter with a presidential candidate. ==Reception== Reviewer Jacob Weisberg of The New York Times wrote "Wolfe is always showing us something we haven't quite noticed. But after three thick novels and a novella (surely he will never write a short story), the issue remains: Why does a writer whose ambitions are so fundamentally journalistic insist on processing his reportage into fiction? You may never put down a Tom Wolfe novel. But you never reread one, either." London-based Literary Review gave Wolfe its 2004 Bad Sex in Fiction Award, an "honor" established "to draw attention to the crude, tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel", for his writing in I Am Charlotte Simmons. Wolfe's 2018 obituary in The New York Times referenced mixed reviews for the book.Deirdre Carmody and William Grimes, Tom Wolfe, Pyrotechnic 'New Journalist' and Novelist, Dies at 88, The New York Times, May 15, 2018, accessed May 15, 2018. ==Proposed adaptation== In 2005, the film rights to I Am Charlotte Simmons were purchased by Trilogy Entertainment, with co-founder John Watson producing and writing the screenplay. Three years later, Liz Friedlander was attached as director, while HBO began looking at developing the book for television. In 2021, Veritas Entertainment acquired the television rights for I Am Charlotte Simmons. The series is being developed at Paramount Television Studios, with Brian Yorkey as showrunner. ==References== ==External links== * Slate Book Club review * The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: 'Moral Suicide,' à la Wolfe, The New York Times, November 16, 2004 Category:2004 American novels Category:American satirical novels Category:Campus novels Category:English-language novels Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books Category:Novels by Tom Wolfe Category:Novels set in Pennsylvania

11921202	I Can't Do That Anymore	"I Can't Do That Anymore" is a song written by Alan Jackson, and recorded by American country music artist Faith Hill. It was released in October 1996 as the fifth and final single from Hill's It Matters to Me album. The song peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Country charts in 1997. ==Content== The song focuses on the female narrator, who sacrifices her individuality by giving up a job, cutting her hair, and tending to household chores in an attempt to satisfy her husband. Finally, she demands acknowledgment for her deeds, saying that she can no longer do what she has been doing, because "a woman needs a little something of her own". In their 2003 book The Women of Country Music, authors Charles K. Wolfe and James Edward Akenson describe the song as "continuing on the topic of self-reflexive exploration" which Hill had built on by previous singles such as "But I Will". While on tour with Jackson in 1994, Hill asked him to write a song for her second album. She rejected the first song that he presented to her, but accepted "I Can't Do That Anymore" after he presented it to her. When Jackson's wife read the song's lyrics, she asked if the song was about her. ==Music video== The video, directed by Jon Small, was filmed on location in Los Angeles. It depicts Hill as a young newlywed whose husband has just moved the couple out west in hopes of striking oil. The footage was edited into two separate videos. The storyline is virtually the same in both versions, but with two completely different outcomes. In one version, Hill grows frustrated with her husband's neglect, and the video ends with no clear resolution (though it is assumed that she leaves him). The alternate version progresses in much the same way, until the very end. Just as Hill is ready to leave her marriage behind, the oil well finally erupts. Hill and her husband instantly forget their frustrations with each other and dance in a shower of the falling oil, a symbol of the better times that await the couple. ==Chart positions== "I Can't Do That Anymore" debuted at number 66 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of October 19, 1996.

11967557	I Can Take You to the Sun	"I Can Take You To The Sun" is a song that was composed and recorded by The Misunderstood at Philips Studio in London in 1966. The song is considered a psychedelic music classic. The single was released to critical acclaim but the band was forced to break up shortly thereafter when lead vocalist/harmonica player Rick Brown was drafted into the Vietnam War. In a release of early BBC Top Gear shows, host John Peel introduced the song with the comment, "This is to my mind the best popular record that's ever been recorded". Peel would later rank the song as his number 3 song for 1966 in his "Peelennium" (Greatest Songs of the 20th Century) list. Record Collector magazine, in a July 1999 article wrote, "The Misunderstood were a band of immense talent (...) Without apologies, the Misunderstood single stands (...) as one of the most powerful and best psychedelic singles ever released." "I Can Take You to the Sun" is mentioned in Record Collector's book "100 Greatest Psychedelic Records". ==References== ==External links== *themisunderstood.com *[ AllMusic article] by Richie Unterberger Category:1966 singles Category:Psychedelic songs Category:Fontana Records singles Category:1966 songs
11991630	I Can Make It Better	"I Can Make It Better" is a song by American recording artist Luther Vandross. It was released in 1996 as the second single from his tenth and platinum album, Your Secret Love (1996). The song reached number 15 on the US Billboard Hot R&B; Singles chart and peaked in the top fifty on the UK Singles Chart. A music video was also produced to promote the single. ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard declared the song as "an old-school soul ballad that reminds everyone why he is a truly untouchable stylist." He added, "In lesser hands, this song would reek of unprogrammable nostalgia. But Vandross cruises through the song with enticing and romantic flair, deftly swerving around an arrangement of strings and horns. A fine way to maintain the interest of R&B; radio program- mers while possibly tweaking popsters who could certainly use a little more pure soul in their lives." A reviewer from Music Week rated the song three out of five, describing it as "a smooth ballad with uptempo touches from the king of lurve". ==Track list== * US, UK CD singleUS CD Single - "I Can Make It Better" (Single) Discogs #"I Can Make It Better" (Single Edit) - 4:29 #"I Can Make It Better" (Charles Roane Remix Edit) - 4:28 #"I Can Make It Better" (Soulshock & Karlin Remix Edit) - 4:28 #"A Kiss For Christmas" - 4:12 Note: "A Kiss for Christmas" is from the Vandross album This Is Christmas (1995) ==Charts== Chart (1996) Peak position Scotland (OCC) 85 ==References== ==External links== * www.luthervandross.com Category:1996 singles Category:1996 songs Category:Luther Vandross songs Category:Epic Records singles Category:Songs written by Luther Vandross Category:Songs written by Marcus Miller
12045541	I Can't Make It	"I Can't Make It" is a song that was released in March 1967 by English band Small Faces. The single peaked at number 26 on the UK Singles Chart. ==Song profile== When "I Can't Make It" was released in 1967, Small Faces had acrimoniously left the management of Don Arden and were signed to Andrew Loog Oldham's Immediate label. However, due to contractual obligations, Decca released the song, and Immediate agreed to produce and license the song back to them until the issue was resolved. The band refused to promote the single and as a direct result, the song only managed to climb to No. 26 in the charts. The BBC also initially banned the song for the dubious sounding lyrics which they thought were of a sexual nature; the lyrics are actually ambiguous and it is left to the listener to decide their true meaning. The B-side, "Just Passing", is a short whimsical song only a minute long and is in the style of The Beach Boys song, "You Still Believe in Me". In April 1967, Small Faces performed a live version of "I Can't Make It" on the well-known British television show, Morecambe and Wise, as well as their UK number-one single, "All or Nothing". The recording is notable for the particularly strong live vocal performance by Marriott. The episode was transmitted six months later. The song can be found on side two of the group's 1969 posthumous double-album The Autumn Stone. "I Can't Make It" and "Just Passing" were also released as bonus tracks on the deluxe editions of From the Beginning in 2012. Furthermore, stereo mixes of both tracks are included on the deluxe editions of the band's 1967 eponymous album. ==See also== *Small Faces discography ==Notes== ==External links== *The Official Small Faces Site *Steve Marriott – The Official Site Category:Small Faces songs Category:1967 singles Category:Songs written by Ronnie Lane Category:Songs written by Steve Marriott Category:1967 songs Category:Decca Records singles Category:Songs banned by the BBC

12077469	I Am a Woman	I Am a Woman is a lesbian pulp fiction novel written in 1959 by Ann Bannon (pseudonym of Ann Weldy). It is the second in a series of pulp fiction novels that eventually came to be known as The Beebo Brinker Chronicles. It was originally published in 1959 by Gold Medal Books, again in 1983 by Naiad Press, and again in 2002 by Cleis Press. Its original title with Gold Medal Books was I Am a Woman In Love With A Woman Must Society Reject Me? Bannon wanted the title to be Strangers in this WorldAnn Bannon(from a conversation the main character has with a stranger who tells her that everyone is a stranger until she finds someone to love), but as Bannon explained in the 2001 edition forward of Odd Girl Out, Gold Medal publishers had control over the cover art and the title. Bannon's editor titled the book. Lesbian pulp fiction books usually showed suggestive art with obscure titles that hinted at what the subject matter was inside.Ann Bannon For the 1983 and 2002 editions, the title was shorted to I Am A Woman. It is followed in the series by Women In The Shadows, also published in 1959. Bannon was inspired to write after reading The Well of Loneliness and Spring Fire. However, it was in this book that Bannon wrote one of the first endings in a work of lesbian fiction where none of the characters commit suicide, goes insane, is killed, or is left completely alone. In an interview in 2003, she reluctantly admitted this was her favorite of the series.Dean, William. "Out of the Shadows: An Interview with Ann Bannon" . January 8, 2003. == Plot summary == One year after leaving college, Laura Landon is exhausted by living with her harsh, judgmental father, who perceives that she failed out of school. Laura leaves home in the middle of the night and goes to New York City. She gets a job as a secretary in a medical office and lands an apartment with a roommate — Marcie. Marcie is young and very impulsive, but vivacious and puts Laura at ease. Laura moves into the apartment in Greenwich Village with a vague gnawing excitement in her. Laura and Marcie develop a routine and Laura learns her new job. Marcie is constantly fighting with her ex-husband Burr, who comes around frequently to date Marcie, and in between fights, they sleep together. Finding that Laura tempers Marcie a bit, she insists that she will only date Burr if Laura is with her — which confounds Laura as she recognizes that she is attracted to Marcie and intensely dislikes Burr. Burr brings along a friend, Jack Mann, and they double date one evening. As a joke, he explains, Jack takes them to a gay bar in Greenwich Village and watches their reactions. Jack is an alcoholic, but is good-natured and has a self-deprecating sense of humor. Laura is intrigued by him, and his friends laugh at him. Jack returns the intrigue when he hears Laura argue with Burr's statement that he can make any of the women in the bar straight if he wanted to. Jack asks her out again and shocks her when he tells Laura he knows she's in love with Marcie. Jack admits he's also gay and helps Laura deal with the realization about herself. She also confides to him that her father hates her because her mother and brother drowned and her father could not save them. After going out a couple times, Jack introduces Laura to a mutual friend, Beebo Brinker (born as Betty Jean), a tall, swaggering, dark-haired butch. They meet later in the gay bar after Laura runs away from Marcie, unable to contain her attraction. After a few drinks, Laura is afraid to return home, so Beebo allows her to sleep on the sofa. From a desperate longing and loneliness, Laura sobers up enough to seduce Beebo and they begin a torrid affair. Laura tells Beebo about Marcie, and Beebo warns Laura that Marcie knows Laura is in love with her and is playing with her. Laura refuses to believe it. Laura attempts to contact her father when he travels to town for a journalists' convention, only to be rebuked. Marcie finally stops speaking to Burr and Burr, frustrated, calls Laura at work and accuses her of being in love with Marcie and keeping her from seeing him. Laura begins to spy on her father and unravel under the strain of her relationship with Marcie. She depends on Jack, who is in a new relationship with a young man, but who expresses his sincere doubt that it will last. After getting drunk and humiliating Beebo in a bar, she's left alone. Exhausted, Laura finally tells Marcie she's in love with her. Marcie, deeply moved by Laura's sincerity and intensity, admits that it was a game for her after all, but will try to return Laura's love. Heartbroken and ashamed, Laura leaves the apartment to confront her father at his hotel. They have a violent fight and Laura hits him over the head with an ashtray and runs. After wandering the night in the rain, Laura shows up at Jack's house fearing she killed her father. Jack and his new boyfriend take care of her. Laura shows up to apologize to Beebo and tells her she loves her. In an ending that was completely different from any previous work of lesbian fiction, they walk together to Beebo's apartment arm in arm. == Reception == Although pulp novels were not reviewed by serious literary journals, The Ladder in 1959 gave it a very favorable review, claiming, "the book is very realistic, the writing is excellent for a paperback, and the ending is so very happy that it sets the book almost in a class by itself. The author is sympathetic herself, but she pulls no punches. She definitely realizes the drawbacks as well as the advantages.". In 1959, ONE, Inc. reviewed I Am A Woman, giving it mixed reviews for the descriptions of the sex scenes and Marcie's "unbelievable" personality, but being especially impressed with Jack and Terry, the happy ending, and the fact that the book was written for homosexuals, as opposed to entertainment for heterosexuals which was much more common. The review read, "It is indeed heartening to read a happy ending in this era of suicidal finishes; and this is a complete happy ending...and works out quite logically. I Am A Woman is a book that basically all homosexual readers, both men and women, will enjoy reading.". A 1969 retrospective of lesbian paperback fiction called I Am A Woman a "blockbuster" that heaps praise on the character of Beebo Brinker, "who carries off a barroom seduction scene that is surely a classic".. Chapter 8 of I Am A Woman was included in a compilation of excerpts from what author-editor Katherine V. Forrest considered the best examples of lesbian pulp fiction books, aptly named Lesbian Pulp Fiction in 2005. In the 1983 Joy Parks, author of the article "Pulps of Passion," read an array of pulp fictions novels by Ann Bannon and wrote review of them for the July/August issue of Body Politic. In this review she stated that I Am A Woman, along with Bannon's other novels, "proved that while love between women was difficult, it was a possibility." She also hailed Bannon's work as "lesbian classic." == References == == External links == * Ann Bannon's website Category:1959 American novels Category:Novels by Ann Bannon Category:Novels with lesbian themes Category:Novels set in New York City Category:1950s LGBT novels Category:American LGBT novels Category:Gold Medal Books books

12243573	I Am the Blues	I Am the Blues is the sixth studio Chicago blues album released in 1970 by the well-known bluesman Willie Dixon. It is also the title of Dixon's autobiography, edited by Don Snowden. The album features songs written by Dixon and originally performed by other artists for Chess Records. == Original performances == Four of the nine songs on I Am the Blues – "Back Door Man", "Spoonful", "I Ain't Superstitious", "The Little Red Rooster" – were originally performed by Howlin' Wolf. "Back Door Man" and "Spoonful" were recorded by Howlin' Wolf in June 1960 featuring bass work by Willie Dixon, piano work by Otis Spann, drum work by Fred Below, and guitar work by Hubert Sumlin. "The Little Red Rooster" was recorded in June 1961 with guitar work by Howlin' Wolf and Hubert Sumlin, piano work by Johnny Jones, bass work by Dixon, and drum work by Sam Lay. "I Ain't Superstitious" was recorded in December 1961 with Howlin' Wolf, Hubert Sumlin, and Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Henry Gray on piano, Willie Dixon on bass, and Sam Lay on drums.

Robert Christgau feels that Dixon's singing ability on the album is not as good as it could be, because he doesn't need to be a good singer since he's a good composer and producer. == Accolades == The album was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1986.Past Hall of Fame Inductees .

12501397	I Advance Masked	I Advance Masked is a 1982 album by English guitarists Andy Summers and Robert Fripp. It is the pair's first of two album collaborations and it consists of 13 instrumental tracks. ==Background== Summers and Fripp had met in Bournemouth in the early 1960s. Summers grew up in the town and was at the time the guitarist of the Zoot Money Big Roll Band. Fripp was attending the Bournemouth and Poole College, where he had enrolled to study economics, economic history and political history. When Fripp and his band the Majestic Dance Orchestra secured their first regular gig at the Bournemouth Majestic Hotel, they replaced Zoot Money and Andy Summers who had just moved to London. Fripp and Summers remained friends over the years, and as soon as they had a break in the touring and recording schedules of their respective bands, King Crimson and The Police, they met for some jams that eventually led to an album. Fripp and Summers recorded at the Arny's Shack studio in Parkstone, Dorset. According to Summers, the album was "a synthesis of two guys who grew up playing guitar, heard the Beatles, listened to jazz, have been influenced by Oriental music and Steve Reich, but still happen to be playing in a rock context. Every track started the same way, just two guitars. On some of them I played a little bass or put on a bit of percussion or string synthesizer. There are no drums but you don't miss them. Some of it is very accessible and some is very avant-garde".Ray Nikart, Sting and The Police, Ballantine Books, New York, 1984. The cover painting is by American pop artist James Rizzi. The title track was released as a single with "Hardy Country" on the flip side. ==Bewitched== Fripp and Summers would go on to record a second album, Bewitched, in 1984. In contrast with I Advance Masked, Bewitched resulted in more of a pop-sounding record. According to Summers, this time the album was about two highly skilled and educated guitarists “meeting on a different mountain and learning how to work together. So much of guitar playing in this sort of situation is human psychology. How do I get the very best out of Robert Fripp in the studio? And we did it. It’s a balanced record.” The only single from the album, "Parade", was supported by a music video but it failed to chart. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Robert Fripp – electric guitars, Moog and Roland synthesizers, Roland guitar synthesizer, Fender bass, percussion * Andy Summers – electric guitars, Moog and Roland synthesizers, piano, Roland guitar synthesizer, Fender bass, percussion Technical personnel *Tim Summerhayes, Tony Arnold – engineer *Andy Summers, Michael Ross – design *James Rizzi – cover *Jill Furmanovsky – photography ==References== Category:1982 albums Category:A&M; Records albums Category:Robert Fripp albums Category:Albums produced by Robert Fripp Category:Andy Summers albums Category:Instrumental duet albums Category:Collaborative albums

12576651	I Can Help	"I Can Help" is a song written"The Billboard Book of Number One Hits" by Fred Bronson, 4th ed. and performed by Billy Swan. Released in July 1974, the song was a big crossover smash, reaching No. 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Singles charts late that fall. Although Swan had other charting singles on both the Hot 100 and country charts, the song is generally recognized as being Swan's only major hit single release. However, Swan had continued success as a songwriter for other artists and as a session musician. ==Production== Billy Swan secured his own recording deal with Monument Records, after his return to Nashville in August 1973. From the time he secured the deal, Swan began the composition of "I Can Help" in a music room which his wife, Marlu, had converted from a closet inside the small duplex that they shared close to Centennial Park.Buskin, Richard. Classic Tracks: Billy Swan "I Can Help". Sound on Sound. November 2007. Accessed from December 21, 2012. Swan has revealed that he used a "Rock" preset, from his Rhythm Master drum machine, when writing the song; "It played 16ths and sounded like a sock cymbal, so I just started playing these chords along with it, and the song came in about 20 minutes. I didn't always write that quickly, but from my experience the ones that come quickly are the good ones. "Lover Please" was like that, and so was "Everything's the Same". With "I Can Help" I actually wrote the three verses first, and since I needed something to put between the second and third verse I then came up with the bridge. The whole thing just came out of the air, including the words." "I Can Help" was written during March 1974, and also during that time Swan recorded it with producer and engineer Chip Young at the Young'un Sound studio in Murfreesboro. The distinctive keyboards were played by Swan on a portable Farfisa belonging to Memphis session musician Bobby Emmons while Young's German Shepherd puppy, Bowser, tugged on his pants leg. The vocals were recorded with a Neumann U 47, while Swan's Farfisa, Mike Leech's bass and Reggie Young's guitar, were all recorded direct. Dennis Linde and Johnny Christopher, who performed for the song on acoustic guitars, were each miked with Sony ECM lapel mics, while the setup for Hayword Bishop's drums comprised another pair of ECMs overhead on the cymbals, an Electrovoice RE15 on the toms, an RE20 on the kick and a Shure SM58 on the snare. Keyboardist Bobby Wood was also booked for the session, but after hearing the track and realising he wasn't needed he joined Emmons and Young in the control room. Emmons and Young suggested overdubbing handclaps at the end to convey an in-studio party atmosphere, as well as adding some bridge-section backing vocals by Lea Jane Berinati and the Holliday Sisters. Swan recalls, "Chip was excited after he recorded that part, but I went out there and listened to it, and I said, 'Boy, I don't know.' I listened to it over and over, until finally I said, 'Hey, man, nothing else will work.' It was actually a great solo, so that just shows you where my head is at. That part was so perfect, and today a lot of people remember the song because of that solo." The album version contains a false ending with the clapping followed by a reasonably extended cadenza on the organ, which then is followed by an instrumental repeat of the ending, followed by another brief organ cadenza, which afterwards is then followed by another instrumental repeat of the ending before the song's fade. ==Release== Swan's version of "I Can Help" was released toward the end of July 1974. To make more money from the song's commercial success, the co-producers returned to Young'un Sound to record more material for an I Can Help album. This included covers of "Don't Be Cruel", "Shake, Rattle and Roll" and Swan's own "Lover Please". However, the success of the song led the record company to argue about which would be the first single on the album. "Everyone at the record company had actually wanted 'The Ways of a Woman in Love' to be the first single," Young recalls. "I said, 'No, wait a minute. That's not the hit. The hit is "I Can Help".' However, [Monument Records president] Fred Foster then hired a guy who was supposed to know the ins and outs of the business, and he said, 'There aren't any hits here. We've gotta re-cut a bunch of stuff.' I said, 'No, we don't have to re- cut a bunch of stuff.' It was a battle from then on." ==Chart performance== In addition to being a No. 1 country and pop hit, "I Can Help" reached No. 6 on Billboard's Hot Adult Contemporary Singles chart and No. 6 on the United Kingdom's Record Retailer chart. In addition, the song was a hit throughout most of Europe and also reached No. 1 in Australia.

12682920	I Always Get What I Want	"I Always Get What I Want" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne for her second studio album Under My Skin (2004). The song was written by Lavigne and Clif Magness, while Magness solely handled production. The song was released digitally as a promotional single in the United States on May 24, 2004 by Arista Records. The song is included as a bonus track on European and Japanese versions of the album, then later included as an iTunes bonus track globally. "I Always Get What I Want" is featured as a B-side on the "Nobody's Home" CD single, which is the third single release from Under My Skin. The song was also featured in the film The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, in addition to appearing on the film's official soundtrack release. ==Background and composition== "I Always Get What I Want" was written by Avril Lavigne and Clif Magness, with Magness also having produced the song. Lavigne had previously worked with Magness on her debut effort, Let Go, having produced the following five songs: "Losing Grip", "Mobile", "Unwanted", "My World", and "Too Much to Ask". Following the release of her debut record, Lavigne sought out new collaborators, including guitarist Evan Taubenfeld and singer Chantal Kreviazuk. Lavigne continued to work with Magness, although only "I Always Get What I Want" would appear on Under My Skin in the form of a bonus track. On May 24, 2004, the song was released digitally as a promotional single on iTunes. "Take Me Away" and "He Wasn't", both of which are present on the parent album, were also released as promotional singles on the same day. "I Always Get What I Want" was later re-released in November 2004 as a B-side to Nobody's Home, the third single from Under My Skin. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, the song is written in the key of C major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 182 beats per minute. Lavigne's vocal range spans two octaves, from B3 to C5. The lyrics of "I Always Get What I Want" carry a message of entitlement, with Lavigne dedicating the song to "any young girl out there who always gets what she wants". ==Reception== "I Always Get What I Want" received generally mixed reviews by music critics. Annabel Leathes of BBC Music compared the song to English alternative rock band Transvision Vamp, declaring that "'I Always Get What I Want' delivers a healthy slap in the face of authority ... and suggests that Avril isn't quite ready to grow up. Caroline Bansal of musicOMH gave the song a positive review, stating that the song "will have alternative music dance floors packed with its high octane guitar and vocals". The song was also praised for its placement on The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement soundtrack, with Michael Paoletta of Billboard designating the track as a highlight from the album. ==Live performances== Lavigne first performed "I Always Get What I Want" at North American concert dates on her second worldwide concert tour, the Bonez Tour (2004–05). The performance of "I Always Get What I Want" during the tour at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, Japan is included on Lavigne's second full-length DVD Bonez Tour 2005: Live at Budokan (2005). The DVD was released exclusively in Japan and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). Lavigne also performed the song on her third worldwide concert tour, The Best Damn World Tour (2008), with the performance of the song at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Canada being included on her third full-length DVD The Best Damn Tour: Live in Toronto (2008). The song has since appeared as a staple at Lavigne's concerts, being included on The Black Star Tour (2011–12), and The Avril Lavigne Tour (2013–14). ==Credits and personnel== Credits and personnel are adapted from the Under My Skin album liner notes. * Avril Lavigne – vocals, writer * Clif Magness – producer, writer, acoustic guitar, bass guitar, electric guitar, keyboards, mixing engineer, piano, programmer, recording engineer * Mark Kiczula – assistant engineer * Beau Fletcher - assistant engineer * Josh Freese – drums ==References== Category:2004 songs Category:Songs written by Clif Magness Category:Songs written by Avril Lavigne Category:Avril Lavigne songs Category:Canadian punk rock songs

12754505	I Am the Mob	"I Am the Mob" is a song by Welsh rock band Catatonia from their album International Velvet. It became the band's second top 40 hit, peaking at No.40. The song's lyrics refer to the gangster movie The Godfather, with lines "I put horses' heads in people's beds, cause I am the Mob", and "That Luca Brasi: ah, he sleeps with the fishes". The song received very little airplay, due to the lyrics being considered unfriendly for radio stations. The recording begins with a short sample "from a discussion on bullying lifted from Jenny Jones – an American talk show." The B-side "My Selfish Gene" later appeared on the International Velvet album. ==Music video== The accompanying music video was directed by Kevin Allen in the highlands of Scotland, showing the band playing with toy boats and fishing. According to Catatonia's guitarist Owen Powell, the video took two days to shoot. He stated that the band did not want the song to look like a pop video, "We wanted it to be slightly different." Catatonia drummer Aled Richards can be seen playing a drum kit model that The Who's Keith Moon used to own, with goldfish inside. Owen Powell claimed that "[Moon] used to put goldfish in it. That's what Aled wanted – a sort of homage to Keith Moon." ==Formats and track listings== * UK CD single # "I Am the Mob" # "Jump or Be Sane" # "Selfish Gene" # "I Am the Mob" (Luca Brasi Mix) ==Charts== Chart (1997) Peak position ==References== ===Sources=== * Category:Catatonia (band) songs Category:1998 singles Category:1998 songs Category:Blanco y Negro Records singles Category:Songs written by Cerys Matthews Category:Songs written by Mark Roberts (singer)
12771894	I Corps (Grande Armée)	The I Corps of the Grande Armée was a French military unit that existed during the Napoleonic Wars. Though disbanded in 1814, following the Treaty of Fontainebleau, it was reformed in April 1815 following the return of Napoléon during the Hundred Days. During the Hundred Days, the corps formed part of the quickly re-formed Army of the North. ==Campaigns== During the mobilisation by Napoléon in 1803, and the subsequent ordnance reforming the army, the new "Army of Hanover or Armée de Hanovre" was formed in French occupied Hanover. This new army was the size of a corps, but under this reorganisation this meant the corps was to be deemed an army (for psychological reasons). On 17 June 1805 Jean Baptiste Bernadotte was made Governor of Hanover, and on 29 August 1805 took control of the new I Corps, and remained in this role for another seven years. ===War of the Third Coalition=== When the War of the Third Coalition was declared, the Army of Hanover was separate from the new Army of Hanover (responsible for the defence of Hanover) and the I Corps. This new corps was formed as part of what later became the famed Grande Armée. On 29 August 1805 the I Corps arrived in Würzburg, and tasked with providing support to the Bavarian Army (now a French ally). During the famed Ulm campaign, the I Corps formed part of the far left flank, preventing the possible retreat of the Austrians under General Karl Mack von Leiberich. As Russian General Mikhail Kutuzov arrived in Eastern Austria/Bavaria, the reality of the situation caused a general retreat towards Moravia, and the I Corps was tasked with ensuring they wouldn't escape. This plan however failed, and it was because of this move that the Battle of Austerlitz in-fact went ahead, because of Kutuzov's successful retreat. Below is the order of battle of the corps on the eve of the Grande Armée's crossing of the Rhine into (what is now) Germany. Order of Battle on 26 October 1805Smith 1998; p. 216.

At the crossing of the Niemen River in 1812, the size of I Corps was around 79,000 men, but six weeks later, about 60,000 men remained. By the end of the Russian campaign, only 2,235 men remained. Under Davout, the I Army Corps left Minsk on 12 July 1812 to cut off Pyotr Bagration from Barclay de Tolly. It fought at Battle of Smolensk (1812), Borodino, Vyazma, and Krasnoi before dissolving as an effective unit during the retreat from Moscow. ===War of the Sixth Coalition=== In 1813, the I Corps was reconstituted and placed under the command of General Dominique Vandamme. The corps was destroyed at Kulm, with the remnants surrendering together with XIV Corps following the siege of Dresden in November 1813. ====Order of battle, 1813==== Order of battle in September 1813

12802504	I Am a Child of God	"I Am a Child of God" is a hymn of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) for all the members, but more often sung by children. The lyrics were written in 1957 by Naomi W. Randall and set to music by Mildred Tanner Pettit. The song has been translated into over 90 languages. The phrase "I Am a Child of God" is also used in the LDS Church as a declaration of a basic teaching of the church. ==Composition== Randall composed the first three verses of "I Am a Child of God" at the request of the general board of the Primary Association, of which she was a member. The board wanted a song that could teach children about LDS Church teachings on the nature of a child's relationship with God. Randall described how she composed the song: > I got down on my knees and prayed aloud, pleading that our Heavenly Father > would let me know the right words. Around 2:00 a.m., I awakened and began to > think again about the song. Words came to my mind. … I immediately got up > and began to write the words down as they had come to me. Three verses and a > chorus were soon formed. I gratefully surveyed the work, drank of the > message of the words, and returned to my bedroom where I knelt before my > Father in Heaven to say "Thank you!"Karen Lynn Davidson (1998). Our Latter- > day Hymns: The Stories and the Messages. The song is still sung in almost > every LDS church at least once per Sunday. (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret > Book) pp. 303–04. Randall mailed the lyrics to her friend Mildred T. Pettit in California, who wrote the accompanying music. ==Word change== The song was first performed at a stake Primary conference in 1957. Several years later, apostle Spencer W. Kimball asked the Primary general board if the phrase "Teach me all that I must know / To live with him someday" could be changed to "Teach me all that I must do / To live with him someday". As Kimball later explained, "To know isn't enough. The devils know and tremble; the devils know everything. We have to do something.""New Verse Is Written for Popular Song," Church News, 1978-04-01, p. 16.See also Pat Graham, "Sharing Time: Fun with Favorites," Friend, October 1984, p. 14. Randall accepted the change. ==Publication and additional verse== The song was first published in the LDS Church's 1969 Sing with Me, a songbook for children. In 1978, Randall composed a fourth verse to the song. However, when the song was added to the LDS Church's 1985 hymnal, the decision was made to not include the fourth verse because it was considered by the Church Correlation Committee to be "not officially part of the song".Abbey Olsen, "Beloved Song Turns 50," Ensign, February 2007, pp. 76–77. When a new church songbook for children was produced in 1989, the fourth verse was included. "I Am a Child of God" is hymn number 301 in the church's 1985 hymnal and on page 2 in the Children's Songbook. ==Use and popularity== "I Am a Child of God" is one of the 45 hymns that the church publishes in its basic curriculum sources“Index of First Lines and Titles,”] Gospel Fundamentals (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2002) p. 276. that are used in areas of the world where the church is new or underdeveloped. Thus, it is often one of the first hymns that new Latter-day Saints receive and learn. The song has been translated into over 90 languages and has been the subject of numerous musical adaptations by choirs and other musicians. "I Am a Child of God" is a common phrase used in curriculum,See, e.g., "Lesson 1: I Am a Child of God," Primary 1: I Am a Child of God (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2000) p. 1; "Lesson 3: I Am a Child of God," Primary 2: Choose the Right A (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 1995) p. 11; "Lesson Five: I Am a Child of God," Family Home Evening Resource Book (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 1997) p. 20. magazines,See, e.g., Vicki F. Matsumori, "Sharing Time: I Am a Child of God," Friend, March 2003, p. 18; Sheila E. Wilson, "Sharing Time: I Am a Child of God," Friend, January 2004, p. 15. sermons,See, e.g., Gordon B. Hinckley, "You Are a Child of God," Liahona, May 2003, p. 117; Russell M. Nelson, "We Are Children of God," Ensign, November 1998, p. 85. and children's clothing,See, e.g., I Am a Child of God baby onesie; I Am a Child of God baby bibs. jewelrySee, e.g., I Am a Child of God necklace. and noveltiesSee, e.g., I Am a Child of God bookmarks; I Am a Child of God lip- balm; I Am a Child of God stickers. as a means of teaching a basic LDS doctrine in simple language. In February 2007, the LDS Church celebrated the 50th anniversary of the writing of "I Am a Child of God". ==Copyright== The copyright to "I Am a Child of God" is owned by Intellectual Reserve, Inc., a corporation established by the LDS Church to hold its intellectual property.

I popped up on his bus to say hi ... we got to talkin' about songs and we passed the guitar back and forth a couple of times and played some new stuff we'd written. We sat there and wrote a brand new song. It's moments like that which are the most exciting ... a song just pops out because you love music."Van Wyk, Anika Jam!

13018810	I Am Sam (TV series)	I am Sam () is a 2007 South Korean television series starring Yang Dong-geun, Park Min-young, Park Jun-gyu, Son Tae-young, and Choi Seung-hyun in his acting debut. It aired on KBS2 from August 6 to October 2, 2007, on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 (KST) time slot for 16 episodes. Based on the Japanese comic series Kyōkasho ni Nai! (in English, Not in a Textbook! or Very Private Lesson), Yang plays a geeky, straight-arrowed, under-qualified high school teacher who becomes a live-in tutor for the troublemaking daughter of a notorious gangster, in exchange for one million won. The title is a word play since sam in Korean roughly translates to "teacher" in slang, thus the international title, I am Your Teacher. ==Synopsis== Yoo Jae-gon (Park Jun- gyu), head of an infamous gangster organization, becomes troubled by the future prospects of his only daughter, Eun-byul (Park Min-young), who refuses to study. Then coincidence or fate brings together Eun-byul and goofy-looking high school teacher Jang Yi-san (Yang Dong-geun) in a somewhat sticky situation. After finding out that Yi-san can actually inspire his troublesome daughter to focus on her studies, Jae-gon offers a deal to Yi-san: become his daughter's private tutor in exchange for one million won. The catch is Yi-san has to move in with her. And the money? It's given as security for his own life. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Yang Dong-geun as Jang Yi-san * Park Min-young as Yoo Eun-byul * Son Tae-young as Shin So-yi * Park Jun-gyu as Yoo Jae-gon (Eun- byul's father) * Choi Seung-hyun as Chae Moo-shin ===Supporting=== * Park Chae-kyung as Min Sa-kang (Eun-byul's friend) * Park Jae-jung as Kim Woo-jin (Mr. Yoo's right-hand man) * Jo Hyang-ki as Hong Dae-ri (Mr. Yoo's assistant) * Kwak Ji-min as Da-bin * Dan Ji as Ye-bin * Ban So-young as Hyo-bin * Lee Min-ho as Heo Mo-se (Principal's son) * Choi Jae-hwan as Han Tae-sung (Moo- shin's friend) * Park Chul-ho as Kim In-seol * Kim Yoo-bin as Kim Hee-chul * Joo Jong-hyuk as Ji Seon-hoo * Kim Hong-shik as Park Nam-kyu * Yoo Tae-woong as Go Dong-sool * Choi Joo-bong as Heo Deok-bae (Principal) * Park Sang-hyun as Park Han-suk * Shin Pyo as Kang Ha ==Reception== I Am Sam received average viewership ratings of around 6.5%. ==Awards== * 2007 KBS Drama Awards: Best New Actress - Park Min-young ==Source material== * Title: () * Original story: Kazuto Okada (岡田和人) * Genre: Comedy, Romance * Age rating: 10+ Oraku is a lucky man...

13196219	I Belong to Glasgow	"I Belong to Glasgow" is a song written and recorded by the music hall entertainer Will Fyffe in 1920. It has been performed by Danny Kaye, Eartha Kitt, Gracie Fields and Kirk Douglas. According to Albert Mackie's The Scotch Comedians (1973), Fyffe got the inspiration for the song from a drunk he met at Glasgow Central Station. The drunk was "genial and demonstrative" and "laying off about Karl Marx and John Barleycorn with equal enthusiasm". Fyffe asked him "Do you belong to Glasgow?", and the man replied "At the moment, at the moment, Glasgow belongs to me."Mackie, Albert David. The Scotch Comedians: from the music hall to television. (Edinburgh: Ramsay Head, 1973) :If your money, you spend, :You’ve nothing to lend, :Isn’t that all the better for you. The song speaks of drink in a period where temperance campaigns were prevalent, and it shows a typical music hall attitude to the supposedly tyrannical wife. The monologue accompanying the song is the origin of several popular humorous catch phrases, including "under the affluence of incohol". The entertainer Harry Lauder was offered the song, but declined because it praised strong drink. As a result of this song, Will Fyffe became forever associated with Glasgow, but he was born away in the east coast city of Dundee. The song was used in the 1955 film The Colditz Story, but the lyric was modified to "I Belong to Colditz". ==References== ==External links== *Song Lyrics *I Belong To Glasgow - Animated Footage on Vimeo Category:Scottish songs Category:Music hall songs Category:1927 songs
13276829	I Can't Live with You	"I Can't Live with You" is a song by the British rock band Queen, which was released in 1991 as the fourth single from their fourteenth studio album Innuendo. The song was written by Brian May but credited to all four members of Queen. It was produced by Queen and David Richards. "I Can't Live with You" was released as a promotional single in the United States only, where it reached No. 28 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart in June 1991. == Writing == "I Can't Live with You" was originally intended for May's debut solo album, Back to the Light. It was recorded by Queen after the other three members of the band expressed their fondness for the track. In a 1991 interview with Guitar World, May said of the song, "As time goes by I find I'm more concerned with the lyrics than ever. A lot of people say you can only create when you're in pain. But when I was really in pain, I couldn't create anything. When you're climbing out and beginning to get things in the right boxes again, that's when you can put it into music. There's quite a bit of that sort of thing on this album. There's some in 'I Can't Live with You'; it's very personal, but I tried not to make it autobiographical because that narrows things too much. I tried to express it in a form that everyone can relate to." == Recording == In his interview with Guitar World, May spoke about the difficulty of mixing the song, "For some reason, 'I Can't Live with You' was almost impossible to mix. It was one of those things where you put all the faders up and it sounds pretty good, and you think, 'We'll work on this for a couple of hours.' Then it gets worse and worse and worse. We kept going back to the rough mix. It's got an atmosphere to it. I think it sounds so special because we kept a lot of the demo stuff on it. Usually it all gets replaced." == Release == For its release as a promotional single in the United States, American producer Brian Malouf remixed the original album track, which was dubbed the 'Malouf Mix'. The mix uses slightly different lead vocal tracks by Freddie Mercury, louder and tighter harmony tracks, and reprogrammed synth drums, resulting in a much more punchy and "over the top" poppy version than included on the album. An alternative version of the song appeared on the 1997 compilation album Queen Rocks, billed as the "'97 Rocks Retake". It is said to be more along the lines of how May and Taylor originally wanted the track to sound, with a harder, guitar-driven rock edge and real drums instead of synth reprogrammed. The original version's vocal was used in this retake. == Critical reception == On its release, Billboard praised the song as a "rhythmic tune, etched with Queen's signature layers of harmonies and Mercury's dramatic delivery". In a retrospective review of Innuendo, Greg Prato of AllMusic felt the song "shows the band's pop sensibilities in full force". == Track listing == CD Promo Single #"I Can't Live with You" (Malouf Mix Edit) – 3:59 #"I Can't Live with You" (Malouf Mix) – 4:33 == Personnel == *Freddie Mercury – lead and backing vocals *Brian May – guitar, keyboard, backing vocals, drum programming *Roger Taylor – backing vocals *John Deacon – bass guitar *David Richards – keyboards == Charts == Chart (1991) Peak position US Billboard Album Rock Tracks 28 ==References== ==External links== * Lyrics at Queen official website (from Queen Rocks) Category:1990 songs Category:1991 singles Category:Queen (band) songs Category:Songs written by Brian May Category:Hollywood Records singles
1344673	I Am the Night—Color Me Black	"I Am the Night—Color Me Black" is episode 146 of the American television anthology series The Twilight Zone. It originally aired on March 27, 1964 on CBS. ==Opening narration== ==Plot== Sheriff Koch cannot sleep the night before the execution of a man, as he feels conflicted about the situation. His wife Ella (Eve McVeagh) is no comfort as she snarls, "What time do they string him up; you know what I mean...what time does he get hung?" Her attitude represents the hateful sentiment of the town that looks forward to the fate of Jagger, a man who is to be hanged after being wrongfully convicted of killing a bigot; he claims self defense, and is unrepentant about the killing. On the day of his execution, the sun does not rise in the morning, and it seems that this is the only place in the world where this is true. There is still some dispute as to whether Jagger is guilty. The sheriff is conflicted, while the deputy is convinced Jagger is guilty; the latter is accused of perjury by the town news reporter. That morning the Deputy becomes loud and obnoxious, and the sheriff tells him: "You better unravel it Pierce, or I'll spread you all over this yard". At 9:00 AM, just before the hanging, it is still dark; the radio now reporting the darkness confined to this one small village. The sheriff admits he feels guilty because he didn't question the lack of autopsy of the victim, and didn't care that there were powder burns on the victim despite the deputy testifying that Jagger shot the victim from across a room. The sheriff wanted to be reelected, and as such went along with the status quo. However, Jagger is hanged anyway at 9:30, much to the delight of the town. The town clergyman, although a different faith and race than Jagger, steps in and says that he is thankful to him for having stood up for him and his kind. The clergyman asks if Jagger had felt hate and enjoyment when he killed the man. Jagger confirmed he did. After this, the clergyman also reluctantly agrees to the execution, proclaiming that Jagger was in fact guilty. Jagger is disheartened, saying “It’s important to get with the majority isn’t it? That’s a big thing nowadays isn’t it, Reverend?” The Reverend replies: "The majority is all there is". After the hanging, the deputy says that for having gone along with the execution, that the clergyman has "seen the light". The clergyman replies that the sky is black because of all the hatred in the world, namely the hatred surrounding Jagger's execution. The sky becomes even darker after the execution. The deputy is convinced that the darkness is nothing more than fog, which will eventually lift, but neither the sheriff or reporter are convinced. Later, a radio broadcast reveals that the town is not the only place where this disturbance is happening. The sky has turned dark over North Vietnam, a section of the Berlin Wall, a political prison in Budapest, a section of Dallas (Dallas, where President Kennedy was fatally shot), and other places around the world where hatred runs rampant. ==Closing narration== ==Cast== *Michael Constantine as Sheriff Charlie Koch *Paul Fix as Colbey *George Lindsey as Deputy Pierce *Ivan Dixon as the Reverend Anderson *Terry Becker as Jagger *Eve McVeagh as Ella *Douglas Bank as Man *Russell Custer as Townsman *Elizabeth Harrower as Woman *Michael Jeffers as Deputy *Robert McCord as Townsman *Ward Wood as Man ==Production notes== Serling wrote this script primarily as his personal reaction to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Indeed, mention is made in the story of "a street in Dallas, Texas" (where Kennedy was murdered as his motorcade traveled down Elm Street in Dallas' Dealey Plaza) as being enveloped by the strange darkness. The episode is similar to "Many, Many Monkeys", a script written for Twilight Zone by its producer, William Froug, but never shot. In that script an epidemic breaks out in which afflicted persons' eyes seal shut as folds of flesh grow over them. Though a nuclear explosion is initially blamed, one character proposes that it is a physical manifestation of hate that is blinding them. The network bought the script but then shelved it, finding its subject matter too disturbing, but it was eventually produced in 1989, during the first revival of Twilight Zone. Years earlier, Serling had written a teleplay for Playhouse 90 called "A Town Has Turned to Dust", about the 1870 lynching of an innocent Mexican man in a Southwestern town. This story was based on the Emmett Till case, and Serling had to deal with executive interference and network censors before the episode could air.Gould, Jack.

13709869	I Am Because We Are	I Am Because We Are is a 2008 British-American-Malawian documentary film about AIDS orphans in Malawi. It was directed by Nathan Rissman and written, narrated, and produced by Madonna through her production company Semtex Films. The film premiered at the 7th annual Tribeca Film Festival in New York City, on April 24, 2008, and at the 61st annual Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France, on May 21, 2008. The film also headlined the 2008 Traverse City Film Festival. On December 1, 2008, it premiered in the U.S. on the Sundance Channel for World AIDS Day. On March 26, 2009, the film was uploaded by Madonna's team onto YouTube and Hulu for free viewing. The film won the VH1 Do Something Docu Style Award in 2010. ==Film== The film documents the lives of orphans in Malawi, where an estimated 500,000 children have lost parents to HIV and AIDS. Many of these children live on the streets. The film also shows the efforts with Madonna's charitable organisation Raising Malawi in helping with improving their lives and conditions. Madonna said about the film: "To say that this film is a labor of love is trivial. It's also the journey of a lifetime. I hope you all are as inspired watching it as I was making it." The film, released in 2008, was described by long-time friend Rosie O'Donnell as "devastating and amazing". Both Madonna and O'Donnell attended a private screening on October 11, 2007. ==Book== A companion book containing 180 pages with 106 duotone and 44 four-color photographs taken during the visit, as well as stills from the video was released in January 2009. Author proceeds from the sale of the book were to be donated to the charitable organization Raising Malawi for their extensive work with orphans throughout Malawi. *Released: January 2009 *Photographer: Kristen Ashburn, with foreword by Madonna *Publisher: PowerHouse ==Title== The title is derived from former archbishop of Cape Town and anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu's speech regarding the African philosophy of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is an idea present in African spirituality that says "I am because we are", or we are all connected, we cannot be ourselves without community, health and faith are always lived out among others, an individual's well-being is caught up in the well-being of others. In Malawi, this African philosophy is known as "uMunthu". In Chichewa, it is kali kokha nkanyama, tili awiri ntiwanthu (when you are on your own you are as good as an animal of the wild; when there are two of you, you form a community).” ==Reception== thumb|left|Nathan Rissman and Madonna at the film's premiere The film received positive reviews in the media. The Times, giving it 4 out of 5 stars, wrote: "This rich material makes for a completely absorbing film. Certain scenes, such as women and children literally dying of AIDS in front of the camera, drew gasps from the shocked audience in the screening room at Cannes. It's impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. Not that the film portrays Malawian people as innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control. Rissman doesn't shy away from the culture of drinking, crime and violence that is prevalent in the country. Together, he and Madonna have made a shocking and incredibly moving film that is much more than an extended Comic Relief appeal." A news article in The Guardian said, "Madonna the documentary-maker came, saw and conquered the world's biggest film festival yesterday with a powerful polemic on the effects of disease and poverty on Malawi...The queen of reinvention presented her film, I Am Because We Are, which she wrote and produced, to general acclaim. Alongside her was her former gardener Nathan Rissman, who directed." The film was shown at the 2008 Traverse City Film Festival, held from July 29 to August 3. Michael Moore, who founded the festival, said in May 2008 about the film: "I saw her film a month ago and was so deeply moved in a way that rarely happens with movies these days. I asked her immediately if she would come to our festival and she said, "yes." I have known her for years and she is truly one of the most caring and generous people I have met. Her presence here in Traverse City will have a profound impact on people." In the fall of 2008, Madonna released a video message announcing plans to build a school in Malawi, the Raising Malawi Academy for Girls. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2008 documentary films Category:2008 films Category:British documentary films Category:Works by Madonna Category:Documentary films about HIV/AIDS Category:Documentary films about poverty Category:American documentary films Category:Malawian documentary films Category:2000s English- language films Category:HIV/AIDS in American films Category:HIV/AIDS in British films Category:2000s American films Category:2000s British films
13936547	I Can't Get Started	"I Can't Get Started", also known as "I Can't Get Started with You" or "I Can't Get Started (with You)", is a popular song. It was written in 1936 by Vernon Duke (music) and Ira Gershwin (lyrics) and introduced that year in the revue Ziegfeld Follies of 1936, where it was performed by Bob Hope and Eve Arden. Hal Kemp and his Orchestra recorded it and it had a bit of popularity, rising briefly to 14th place on the recording charts. Bunny Berigan's 1937 version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. ==Recordings== Ira Gershwin noted in 1959 that "The sheet-music sale of the song never amounted to much... but an early recording by Bunny Berigan—considered by jazz devotees a sort of classic in its field—may have been a challenge (or incentive) for the great number of recordings that have followed. Not a year has gone by, in the past fifteen or so, that up to a dozen or more new recordings haven't been issued." ===Bunny Berigan=== Bunny Berigan, a trumpeter with Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey, started a band in 1937 and chose "I Can't Get Started" as his theme song.Simon, George T., The Big Bands, 4th Edition, Introduction by Frank Sinatra, Schirmer Books, New York, 1981 p. 88 He had been performing the song during the previous year at a club in New York City. He made a recording for Vocalion on April 13, 1936 but gradually he made subtle changes in the arrangement. After forming his band, he recorded "I Can't Get Started" again, this time for Victor. Jazz trumpeter Dick Sudhalter noted the changes that had been made since the Vocalion recording. "An introduction—an extended cadenza over four different sustained chords in the key of C—had been added by this time, but otherwise Berigan's routine had not changed since the Vocalion recording. But whereas the Vocalion comes across as a virtuoso performance of a great song, the Victor version presents itself as a kind of concerto, a tour de force for a trumpeter of imagination and daring having impeccable command of his instrument." The Berigan band's recordings of "I Can't Get Started" and "The Prisoner's Song" were issued together on the twelve-inch Victor record 36208, and were a part of an album of four such records entitled A Symposium of Swing. An edited version was created by Victor on December 4, 1937, and issued as 25728A. The recording was a hit and reached number 10 on the chart. In 1975, Berigan's 1937 recording of "I Can't Get Started" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Billie Holiday recorded it on September 15, 1938. ===Other recordings=== * Duke Ellington – Piano in the Foreground (1961) * Paul Bley Trio – (Paul Bley/Charles Mingus/Art Blakey) – Introducing Paul Bley (1953) * Hamiet Bluiett with Ted Dunbar – Ballads and Blues (1994) * Roy Eldridge – Happy Time (1975) * Maynard Ferguson - Chameleon (1974) * Ella Fitzgerald – Newport Jazz Festival: Live at Carnegie Hall (1973) * Stan Getz with Kenny Barron – Anniversary!

14262911	I Can Love You	"I Can Love You" is a song by American recording artist Mary J. Blige. It was written by Blige along with her sister LaTonya Blige-DaCosta, Rodney Jerkins, and Lil' Kim for her third album, Share My World (1997), with Jerkins producing the song and Lil Kim having featured vocals. In addition, the song also features a sample of the song "Queen Bitch," a track from Kim's debut album Hard Core (1996), co-written by Carlos Broady and Nashiem Myrick. "I Can Love You" was released as the second single from Share My World in the US, where it reached number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Release and reception== "I Can Love You" was issued as a commercial single in America, unlike the first single "Love Is All We Need". Ultimately, it peaked at number two on the R&B; singles chart and number twenty-eight on the American pop chart. In the UK, the song was released as the b-side to "Missing You". ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, "R&B; radio has already deemed this second single from the gorgeous Share My World as a deserved smash—now it's time for pop programmers to do the same. Like its predecessor, "Love Can Turn Around", this jam cruises at an uplifting jeep-funk pace, with Miss Blige getting sultry over layers of soothing love chants tightly arranged by producer-of-the-moment Rodney Jerkins. The result is a wickedly catchy jam that will sooth a brow fevered by the ongoing spree of factory-like funk that crowds the airwaves. Top 40 will probably focus on the snug rap-free edit, though the more airy and expansive album version has a guest rhyme by Lil' Kim that's quite cute and well worth a listen." ==Music video== The accompanying music video for "I Can Love You" was shot in May 1997 and directed by Kevin Bray. Shot at a house and forest, It features Mary, Kim, and other people that are partying and having fun. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from the Share My World liner notes. * Mary J.

14267167	I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle	I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle is a 1990 British comedy horror film about a motorcycle possessed by an evil spirit, which rides by itself and kills people, particularly members of a particular motorcycle gang. It stars Neil Morrissey as the bike's owner, Michael Elphick as a police inspector and Anthony Daniels as a priest who attempts to exorcise the bike's evil spirit. ==Plot== A motorbike gang kills an occultist with a crossbow during a satanic ritual. One of the motorcycles is damaged during the ritual and an evil spirit inhabits it. Noddy is then seen purchasing the bike from a dealer, but lies to his girlfriend, Kim, about the price. He proceeds to take it home and fix the damage caused by the crossbow alongside his friend, named Buzzer, and Kim. They replace the fuel tank, but when Buzzer steals the petrol cap, the bike kills him via decapitation. When Noddy goes to the scene of his friend's death, he meets an inspector who smells like garlic. That night, he has multiple nightmares about Buzzer. The next day, Noddy and Kim go to a pub. Ten members of the motorbike gang from the beginning of the film enter the bar, and one of the bikers shoots the building with the crossbow. Kim is attacked by one of the bikers after declining his advances, which starts a bar-wide brawl between the motorbike gang, Kim, and Noddy. During the brawl, Noddy is shot by a crossbow bolt. Noddy and Kim get Chinese food. When Kim orders garlic prawns, the bike drives off with her. It takes her under a bridge, throws her off, and makes advances at her. When it notices a crucifix around her neck, the bike drives back to the pub, where the a member of the motorcycle gang attempts to steal it. The bike stabs the leader through the leg with a large metal spike, then launches him at some graffiti artists. The bike then proceeds to decapitate the majority of the biker gang, leaving only one member, named Roach, alive. Noddy discovers Kim has been taken to hospital. When he arrives, she has a hollow look in her eyes and is describing the bike's advances to the inspector. Noddy goes to a priest, who also owns a motorcycle. The two travel to the garage where Noddy's bike is kept, and at first the priest does not believe Noddy. The bike, not wanting to be taken into the sunlight, uses its brake lever to sever the priest's fingers. Determining the bike is a vampire, the priest decides to hold an exorcism. He gives Kim a crucifix and garlic, as he believes the bike will return for her. The priest throws a shuriken at a fly on the wall before exclaiming "Right, let's go kick some bottom!" The vampire bike telepathically disables the bike Noddy and the priest are riding, so they decide to call a taxi but instead wait for a bus. It is a race against the sun to find the vampire bike before nightfall, when it will be free to roam again. During the exorcism, supernatural events occur around Noddy and the priest. Believing to have successfully vanquished the demon, the priest sprinkles the bike with holy water, which makes the bike angry. It grows spikes and turns a glowing red color. Noddy steals a police motorcycle, dragging the policeman, who is almost run over by the vampire bike, behind him. The bike is chased by a police car, while the priest attempts to explain the situation to the authorities. Meanwhile, Kim is washed and her garlic is removed. The bike evades the police by driving vertically down a wall and goes to the hospital to kill Kim, but not before cleaving a hospital employee in two. Kim uses her crucifix to scare the vampire bike away, so it goes after Roach, passing the priest and inspector in the corridor of the hospital. Roach crashes while fleeing and lands in a coffin. The bike then tries to kill Noddy, but it gets its front wheel stuck in a bridge. This gives Noddy the chance to throw it in a river and spit at the bike. Thinking he is safe, Noddy has a victory cigarette, but behind him, the bike glows red underwater. Noddy then sees it and screams, running to hide in a gym. The bike finds him and starts attacking the patrons with its spikes. Noddy then bashes the bike, which feigns death, making everyone feel safe until it starts throwing people's limbs in the air. The inspector scares the bike with his smell. It manages to trap Noddy against a wall, but is stopped when Noddy turns on a sun bed. Everyone works together to force the bike into the light and it melts. Kim asks how much Noddy really spent on the bike and the priest says they are usually reliable. Back in Noddy's workshop, he accidentally cuts his hand. His blood drips onto the bike's old fuel tank, which springs open. ==Cast== *Neil Morrissey - Noddy *Amanda Noar - Kim *Michael Elphick - Inspector Cleaver *Anthony Daniels - Priest *Andrew Powell - Roach *George Rossi - Chopper *Daniel Peacock - Buzzer *Midge Taylor - First Road Toad *David Daker - Desk Sergeant *Burt Kwouk - Fu King Owner *Brendan Donnison - Satanist High Priest *Graham Padden - Dorm *Paula Ann Bland - Hospital Nurse *Terence Budd - Bikes *Ann Casson - Mrs. Bancroft *Douglas Campbell - Mr. Bancroft *Ed Devereaux - Pub Landlord *Colin Campbell - Moped *John Wolskel - Clyde *Solly Assa - Victor *Esta Charkham - Mrs. P.C. Harold ==Production== I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle was written and produced by two former Central Television film editors who developed the idea for the film following a screening of Sam Raimi's film The Evil Dead. Director Dirk Campbell stated that he "wanted the film to have the look of a serious horror movie, a dark gritty realistic look that used the decaying back streets of Birmingham, so there's nothing that jumps out at you to tell you it's a comedy". Coincidentally, three of the major cast members - Neil Morrissey, Michael Elphick and David Daker were from Central's comedy-drama series Boon, whose major premise also revolved around motorcycles. ==Release== The film's portrayal of women resulted in it being refused a screening at the Avoriaz International Fantasy Film Festival. Nigel Floyd commented on these scenes in the film in the Monthly Film Bulletin as being "questionable" with "leering breasts, bum and crotch shots of Kim, seen from the Bike's point of view, might be overlooked as consistent with the film's adolescent tone." while stating that "there is no justification for including the scene in which the bike pursues a high heeled prostitute down a dark alley. ==References== ==External links== * Category:British comedy horror films Category:1990 horror films Category:1990 films Category:Films set in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Motorcycling films Category:Outlaw biker films Category:1990s English-language films Category:1990s British films
14281607	I Am an Impure Thinker	I Am an Impure Thinker is a book by Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy (1888-1973), German social philosopher and is an English-language introduction to Rosenstock-Huessy’s German-language book, Soziologie. It is a collection of essays, which represents an accessible introduction to Rosenstock-Huessy’s thought. The "impure thinker" title reflects the author’s escape from the bounds set by academic tradition, his belief that thought must be accompanied by passionate convictions and engagement, and that sterile intellect is a disease. While apparently unrelated, the essays nevertheless have an underlying unity, which runs through his discussion of the concepts of William James, the Gospels, the Egyptian symbol of Ka, and other uncommon sources. Together the essays contribute to the discovery of a post-theological language. They answer Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s question: “How can we speak of God to modern man who ‘has come of age?’” It has been recognized as a summary of Rosenstock-Huessy's insights into Western culture by such thinkers as W. H. Auden, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin E. Marty, and Harold J. Berman. ==Overview== Rosenstock-Huessy's collection of essays summarize themes and major methodological concerns from his work and provide autobiographical material. In the opening chapter, Farewell to Descartes, he writes: The emphasis upon his impurity is, in large part, one further missive directed at the claims of philosophers who wish, through reason, to achieve truth in its purity. We are, for Rosenstock-Huessy, always caught up in the stresses and strains and impurities of the world and we have a much better chance of improving our condition if we accept this reality and get on with it. In the foreword of the book, W. H. Auden writes: That summarizes of Rosenstock- Huessy's procedure, which combines the personal and the socio-historical. ==Assessment of Speech and Reality== In the foreword of the book, W. H. Auden writes: Eberhardt Bethge wrote of the author: In his book, By Way of Response, Martin E. Marty writes: In his book, Law and Revolution: The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition, Harold J. Berman cites I am an Impure Thinker as contributing to the insights on the discussion of law and revolution. == References == == External links == * The official web site of the Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy Fund and Argo Books includes a biography, accessed 20 March 2007 * The Norwich Center, Norwich, Vermont, maintains an internet site devoted to an introductory biography and appreciation of Eugen Rosenstock- Huessy, signed by Clinton C.

14290580	I Am an Animal	I Am an Animal: The Story of Ingrid Newkirk and PETA was a 2007 documentary about Ingrid Newkirk, co-founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and her crusade for animal rights. It premiered on November 19, 2007 on HBO. Production credits include Matthew Galkin (director and producer), Sheila Nevins (executive producer), Steven Cantor (producer), and Mikaela Beardsley (producer). In the film, Newkirk expresses her goal of "total animal liberation," her solidarity with Animal Liberation Front, and states that footage PETA obtains surreptitiously "has the potential to save the world". The film includes a personal perspective on the life of Ingrid Newkirk and her daily routine of balancing her own life and protecting the life of animals. It exposes her willingness to go to the extreme in her fight for animal rights. Due to her commitment and dedication to the fight for ethical treatment of animals, Ingrid Newkirk illustrates why PETA is one of the most successful animal rights organizations. Matthew Galkin was asked in an interview why he chose to film this documentary, and he claimed that it was a classic David and Goliath story of advocating on the behalf of animals. He wanted to raise awareness and encourage animal rights activism. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2007 films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about animal rights Category:HBO documentary films Category:2007 documentary films Category:People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s American films
143172	I Am the Walrus	"I Am the Walrus" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1967 television film Magical Mystery Tour. Written by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney, it was released as the B-side to the single "Hello, Goodbye" and on the Magical Mystery Tour EP and album. In the film, the song underscores a segment in which the band mime to the recording at a deserted airfield. Lennon wrote the song to confound listeners who had been affording serious scholarly interpretations of the Beatles' lyrics. He was partly inspired by two LSD trips and Lewis Carroll's 1871 poem "The Walrus and the Carpenter". Producer George Martin arranged and added orchestral accompaniment that included violins, cellos, horns, and clarinet. The Mike Sammes Singers, a 16-voice choir of professional studio vocalists, also joined the recording, variously singing nonsense lines and shrill whooping noises. Since the "Hello, Goodbye" single and the Magical Mystery Tour EP both reached the top two slots on the British singles chart in December, "I Am the Walrus" holds the distinction of reaching numbers one and two simultaneously. Shortly after release, the song was banned by the BBC for the line "Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down". ==Composition== According to author Ian MacDonald, the "model" for "I Am the Walrus" was most likely Procol Harum's "A Whiter Shade of Pale", which was a hit single during the summer of 1967 and Lennon's favourite song of the period. The lyric came from three song ideas that Lennon had been working on, the first of which was inspired by hearing a police siren at his home in Weybridge; Lennon wrote the lines "Mis- ter cit-y police-man" to the rhythm and melody of the siren. The second idea was a short rhyme about Lennon sitting amidst his garden, while the third was a nonsense phrase about sitting on a corn flake. Unable to finish the three different songs, he combined them into one. The lyric also included the phrase "Lucy in the sky", a reference to the Beatles' earlier song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds". The walrus refers to Lewis Carroll's poem "The Walrus and the Carpenter" (from the book Through the Looking-Glass). Lennon later expressed dismay upon belatedly realising that the walrus was a villain in the poem. The final piece of the song came together during a visit from Pete Shotton, Lennon's friend and former fellow member of the Quarrymen, when Lennon asked him about a playground nursery rhyme they sang as children. Shotton recalled the rhyme as follows: Lennon borrowed a couple of images from the first two lines. Shotton was also responsible for suggesting that Lennon change the phrase "waiting for the man to come" to "waiting for the van to come". The Beatles' official biographer, Hunter Davies, was present while the song was being written and wrote an account in his 1968 book The Beatles. According to this biography, Lennon remarked to Shotton, "Let the fuckers work that one out." While the band were studying Transcendental Meditation in India in early 1968, George Harrison told journalist Lewis Lapham that one of the lines in "I Am the Walrus" incorporated the personal mantra he had received from their meditation teacher, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. According to Pattie Boyd, Harrison's wife at the time, the words "semolina pilchard" refer to Sergeant Pilcher of the London Drug Squad, who waged a campaign against British rock stars and underground figures during the late 1960s. Lennon claimed he wrote the first two lines on separate acid trips; he explained much of the song to Playboy in 1980: ==Musical structure== The song is in the key of A, and the instrumental introduction starts in the Lydian mode of B major. Verse 1 begins with a I–III–IV–I rock pattern: "I am he" (A chord)..."you are me" (C chord) "and we are all toge..." (D chord) "...ther" (A chord). Verse 2, however, involves a VI–VII–I Aeolian ascent: "waiting" (F chord) "for the van" (G chord) "to come" (A chord). The chorus uses a III–IV–V pattern: "I am the eggman (C chord) "they are the eggmen (D chord). "I am the walrus (E chord), "coo-coo-ca-choo" hanging as an imperfect cadence until resolved with the I (A chord) on "Mr. City Policeman". At the line "Sitting in an English garden" the D melody note (as in the instrumental introduction) establishes a Lydian mode (sharp 4th note in the scale), and this mode is emphasised more strongly with the addition of a D note to the B chord on "If the sun don't come". The song ends using a Shepard tone, with a chord progression built on ascending and descending lines in the bass and strings, repeated as the song fades. Musicologist Alan W. Pollack analyses: "The chord progression of the outro itself is a harmonic Moebius strip with scales in bassline and top voice that move in contrary motion." The bassline descends stepwise A, G, F, E, D, C, and B, while the strings part rises A, B, C, D, E, F, G: this sequence repeats as the song fades, with the strings rising higher on each iteration. Pollack also notes that the repeated cell is seven bars long, which means that a different chord begins each four-bar phrase. The fade is described by Walter Everett as a "false ending", in the form of an "unrelated coda" consisting of the orchestral chord progression, chorus, and sampling of the radio play.Walter Everett. The Foundations of Rock: From "Blue Suede Shoes" to "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes". p. 154 ==Recording== "I Am the Walrus" was the first studio recording made by the Beatles after the death of Brian Epstein, in August 1967. The basic backing track featuring the Beatles was released in 1996 on Anthology 2. George Martin arranged and added orchestral accompaniment that included violins, cellos, horns, and clarinet. Paul McCartney said that Lennon gave instructions to Martin as to how he wished the orchestration to be scored, including singing most of the parts as a guide. The Mike Sammes Singers, a 16-voice choir of professional studio vocalists, also took part in the recording, variously singing "Ho-ho-ho, hee-hee-hee, ha-ha-ha", "oompah, oompah, stick it up your jumper!", "everybody's got one" and making a series of shrill whooping noises. In 2015, founding Moody Blues member Ray Thomas said in an interview that he and fellow band member Mike Pinder contributed backing vocals to the song, as well as harmonicas to "The Fool on the Hill". ===Incorporation of text from King Lear=== The dramatic reading in the mix is Shakespeare's King Lear (Act IV, Scene 6), lines 219–222 and 249–262.Robert Fontenot, "I Am the Walrus", on Oldies Music page from about.com . Retrieved 2 May 2014 It was added to the song on 29 September 1967,Dave Rybaczewski, "I Am The Walrus", on Beatles Music History . Retrieved 2 May 2014. recorded directly from an AM radio Lennon was fiddling with. Lennon tuned around the dial and settled on the 7:30 pm to 11 pm broadcast of the play on the BBC Third Programme. The first excerpt (ll. 219–222) moves in and out of the text, containing fragments of lines only. It begins where the disguised Edgar talks to his estranged and maliciously blinded father the Earl of Gloucester (timings given): In the play Edgar then kills Oswald, Goneril's steward. During the fade of the song the second main extract (ll. 249–262), this time of continuous text, is heard (timings given):Walter Everett. The Beatles as Musicians. Revolver Through the Anthology. Oxford University Press. NY. 1999. . . pp. 134–35. On the radio broadcast the roles were read by Mark Dignam (Gloucester), Philip Guard (Edgar), and John Bryning (Oswald). ==Mono vs. stereo versions== In the original (1967) stereo release, at around two minutes through the song, the mix changes from true stereo to "fake stereo". This came about because the radio broadcast had been added "live" into the mono mix-down and so was unavailable for inclusion in the stereo mix; hence, fake stereo from the mono mix was created for this portion of the song. The mono version opens with a four-beat chord, while the stereo mix features six beats on the initial chord. The four-beat-only intro is also included on a different stereo mix (overseen by George Martin) for the previous MPI Home Video version of Magical Mystery Tour, especially the US Magical Mystery Tour album. The US mono single mix includes an extra bar of music before the words "yellow matter custard". This is actually the original uncut version of the mono mix called RM23. An early, overdub-free mix of the song released on Anthology 2 reveals John singing the lyrics "Yellow mat-" too early over this 'extra' bar of music which was later edited out. A hybrid version prepared for the 1980 US Rarities LP combines the six-beat opening with the extra bar of music that precedes the words "yellow matter custard" (from the aforementioned US mono single mix). An entirely new full stereo remix was done in 2012 for Apple's DVD and Blu-ray release of the restored version of Magical Mystery Tour. A 5.1 surround sound full stereo remix of the song appeared on the DVD release of Anthology in 2003, on disc 4. A full stereo digital remix was also done for the Cirque du Soleil show Love and album of the same name, released in 2006. Producers George and Giles Martin were allowed access to early generations of the original master tapes. Musical parts that had previously been mixed were now available as separate elements. Additionally, a copy of the BBC broadcast of King Lear was acquired. Now, with all the sound sources used in the original mono mix present, a proper stereo remix could be accomplished. These tracks were transferred digitally and lined up to create a new multi-track master, from which a new mix would be made. In addition to the stereo remixes prepared for the Love show and the 2012 Apple reissue referenced above, the DVDs that were released for those same projects contain a 5.1 surround sound mix of the song, making three distinct 5.1 remixes of the same song. == Cover versions == *Danny Elfman's Oingo Boingo performed a cover of the song on Boingo, the band's last album. The rough detour from their previous genres, the experimenting of samples for conceptual tracks (such as "Change", the album's last track), the circus-like aesthetic, and the addition of the "I Am the Walrus" cover suggest a significant influence of the late-Beatles era on the band. *Oasis performed the song many times throughout their history, and a live recording of them performing the song at the Gleneagles Hotel was included as a B-side to "Cigarettes & Alcohol" and was subsequently added to the 25th anniversary edition of Definitely Maybe. *Jim Carrey performed the song on George Martin's 1998 Beatles tribute album In My Life. ==Personnel== *John Lennon – lead vocals, electric piano and Mellotron *Paul McCartney – bass guitar, tambourine *George Harrison – electric guitar *Ringo Starr – drums *Orchestrated, directed and produced by George Martin *Session musicians – strings, brass, and woodwinds *Mike Sammes singers – backing vocals *Ray Thomas – backing vocals *Mike Pinder – backing vocals *Engineered by Geoff Emerick and Ken Scott ==Reception== right|thumb|Advertisement for the "I Am the Walrus" single. Critical reception at the time of the track's release was largely positive. Writer Derek Johnson stated: "John growls the nonsense (and sometimes suggestive) lyric, backed by a complex scoring incorporating violins and cellos. You need to hear it a few times before you can absorb it." Nick Logan wrote: "Into the world of Alice in Wonderland now and you can almost visualise John crouching on a deserted shore singing 'I am the walrus' to some beautiful strings from far away on the horizon and a whole bagful of Beatle sounds, like a ringing doorbell and someone sawing a plank of wood. A fantastic track which you will need to live with for a while to fully appreciate." In a review for Melody Maker, Nick Jones considered the song "not such a complex sound as a lot of previous Beatles stuff but it builds nicely to a chattering, spinning cacophony of electricity and hissing gongs behind a barely audible "conversation"". Richard Goldstein of The New York Times wrote that the song was "their most realized work since 'A Day In The Life'" and described it as "a fierce collage" with a "musical structure [that] mirrors this fragmentation". He said it "suggests a world much like that of 'A Day In The Life,' where the news is bad and John Lennon (now a Walrus, with a drooping moustache) would like to turn us on. Because he is an artist, he does." In a highly unfavourable review of Magical Mystery Tour, Rex Reed of HiFi/Stereo Review said that "I Am the Walrus" "defies any kind of description known to civilized man. Not only is it ugly to hear, lacking any cohesion of style or technique, but it is utterly silly and pointless." He stated that the song "begins with an intro sounding suspiciously like one of John Barry's James Bond film scores", then quoted some of the lyrics before saying that "the whole thing fades out to what sounds like people being fried on electric fences and pigs rooting in a bucket of swill." The song was banned by the BBC for the use of the word "knickers" in the line "You’ve been a naughty girl, you’ve let your knickers down".www.telegraph.co.uk .beatlesebooks.com . ===Chart history=== Chart (1967–68) Peak position New Zealand (Listener) 17 US Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–1990 - 56 US Cash Box Top 100 46 The single achieved sales of over 50,000 copies in Australia, being eligible for the award of a Gold Disc. ==Interpretation== After receiving a letter from a student at his former school, Quarry Bank High School for Boys, about how literature classes there were analysing the Beatles' songs, Lennon wrote "I Am the Walrus" to confuse those who tried to interpret it. There have nevertheless been many attempts to understand the meaning of the lyrics. Lennon returned to the subject in the lyrics of three of his subsequent songs: in the 1968 Beatles song "Glass Onion" he sings, "I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man / You know that we're as close as can be, man / Well here's another clue for you all / The walrus was Paul". Eric Burdon, lead singer of the Animals, claimed to be the "Eggman" mentioned in the song's lyric. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * Category:The Beatles songs Category:Song recordings produced by George Martin Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Music based on Alice in Wonderland Category:Oasis (band) songs Category:Parlophone singles Category:Songs published by Northern Songs Category:Songs written by Lennon–McCartney Category:Styx (band) songs Category:1967 singles Category:1967 songs Category:Songs based on speech samples Category:Works based on King Lear Category:Censorship of music Category:Obscenity controversies in music Category:Songs banned by the BBC
14320639	I Come for to Sing	I Come for to Sing was a folk music revue performed by Chicago musicians and singers Win Stracke, Big Bill Broonzy and Lawrence Lane. The program was narrated by Studs Terkel. I Come for to Sing ran successfully for more than ten years, touring colleges and clubs throughout the United States, with the bulk of the activity taking place in the Midwest. Most notably, the show ran for more than a year at the now defunct Chicago jazz club, The Blue Note. In a 2007 article in the Chicago Tribune, Terkel remembered his years with I Come for to Sing, Cast members rotated in and out over the years and included banjo player Fleming Brown, pianist Chet Roble and other performers who happened to be available, but the format of the show remained constant. The narrator set the tone for the evening by reading some prose or poetry or adding commentary, and the musicians reflected on that theme by performing folk songs from different musical traditions. It is notable as the meeting place for the founders of the Old Town School of Folk Music. The Old Town School also published a folk magazine with the same name from 1975 to 1987. == References == == External links == *Chicago Tribune - Studs Terkel talks about the program on the 50th anniversary of the Old Town School of Folk Music.

14389113	I Can't Stand It (Eric Clapton song)	"I Can't Stand It" was the first single from Eric Clapton's 1981 album Another Ticket. On the record label for the vinyl 45, its credited as Eric Clapton and His Band. It was also used for interludes on Bill O'Reilly's radio show, The Radio Factor. ==Reception== Record World called it a "dark, driving rocker with Clapton's vocal lurking ominously around drum spanks & keyboard textures." AllMusic critic Matthew Greenwald recalls the song as "one of Eric Clapton's biggest hits from the early '80s" and found "this song found him continuing, in his words, to be as much a musicologist as a musician." Greenwald goes on to saying that the song's "lyrics have a venomous jealousy, and they are some of Clapton's most literate of the period". He rounded his review up by saying that "musically, some classic, almost Booker T. & the M.G.'s-styled chord changes highlight the driving tempo, providing Clapton with a huge hit". William Ruhlman of AllMusic recalls that I Can't Stand It "held up well". Besides becoming a pop hit in its own right, reaching No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, it was also the first No. 1 song on Billboard's Top Tracks chart for rock songs, which debuted in March 1981. It stayed at the summit for two weeks. The song reached No. 15 in Canada. By 1981, Broadcast Music, Inc. measured more than one million broadcasts of the song, earning Clapton a special recognition certificate. ==Chart positions== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1981) Peak position Canada (CHUM) 7 Canada (RPM) 15 France (IFOP) 62 Israel (IBA) 1 Italy (AFI) 99 Japan (Oricon) 84 US Billboard Hot 100 10 US Top Rock Tracks (Billboard) 1 Year-end chart (1981) Rank US Top Pop Singles (Billboard) 67 ==See also== *List of Billboard Mainstream Rock number-one songs of the 1980s ==References== Category:1980 songs Category:1981 singles Category:Eric Clapton songs Category:Number-one singles in Israel Category:RSO Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Tom Dowd Category:Songs written by Eric Clapton

At the time Mbeki was the Deputy President of South Africa under the presidency of Nelson Mandela. The speech defined the political mood of the moment in post-Apartheid South Africa and enhanced Mbeki's reputation as a political orator, in which respect he has been likened to Martin Luther King Jr.David Beresford, "The flawed visionary of New Africa" (a profile of Thabo Mbeki), The Guardian Jan. 9, 1999. ==References== ==External links== *Full text of the speech on waybackmachine *Thabo Mbeki at wikisource Category:1996 speeches Category:History of the African National Congress Category:1996 in South Africa Category:May 1996 events in Africa
14677235	I Breathe In, I Breathe Out	"I Breathe In, I Breathe Out" is a song recorded and co-written by American country music artist Chris Cagle. It was first recorded by David Kersh on his 1998 album If I Never Stop Loving You; Kersh's version was not released as a single. Cagle himself later recorded the song for a re-issue of his debut album Play It Loud. Released in September 2001, his version reached Number One on the U.S. Billboard country music charts in early 2002, giving Cagle the only Number One hit of his career. It also reached number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100, his only Top 40 hit to date on that chart. ==Content== "I Breathe In, I Breathe Out" is a ballad that discusses the end of a relationship, and coping with it. The narrator discusses what he is doing after the breakup, and when asked by various people what he is doing without his significant other, he replies that he takes each day as it comes and subsequently hopes and waits for his ex to realize that they need each other. ==Music video== The music video was directed by Eric Welch and was released in late 2001. ==Peak positions== "I Breathe In, I Breathe Out" debuted at number 58 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of September 22, 2001.

14742899	I Believe You	"I Believe You" is a love ballad composed by Don and Dick Addrisi which was a 1977 single for Dorothy Moore; taken from her self-titled Dorothy Moore album. "I Believe You" reached #5 R&B; and crossed over to the US Pop Top 30 at number 27.Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–1990 - The track also reached number 20 in the UK. ==Carpenters cover== The song was recorded by the Carpenters and released as a single in June 1978. While it reached number 9 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, it peaked at a disappointing #68 on the Billboard Hot 100, owing significantly to the fact that its accompanying album was delayed indefinitely (it would be three more years until their next album was released), reportedly due to Karen's health issues, although Richard at the time was also dealing with his own addiction to quaaludes. In June 1981 the album Made in America—which included "I Believe You"—was finally released. The potential success "I Believe You" might have had it been issued in conjunction with an LP was underscored when the album's eventual lead single, "Touch Me When We're Dancing", became the first Carpenters hit to reach the Hot 100's Top 20 as well as number 1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart since "There's a Kind of Hush" did the same in early 1976. ==Personnel== *Karen Carpenter – lead and backing vocals *Richard Carpenter – backing vocals, piano, Fender Rhodes electric piano, celesta, vocal arrangements *Joe Osborn – bass *Larrie Londin – drums *Tim May – acoustic and electric guitars *Jerry Steinholtz – congas *Uncredited - bell tree, flute, oboe, shaker, triangle *Paul Riser - orchestration ==Chart history== ;Dorothy Moore Chart (1977) Peak position Canada RPM Top Singles 29 Canada RPM Adult Contemporary 13 UK (OCC) 20 US Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–1990 - 27 US Billboard R&B; 5 US Billboard Adult Contemporary 24 US Cash Box Top 100 Cash Box Top 100 Singles, October 22, 1977 28 ;The Carpenters Chart (1978) Peak position Canadian RPM Top Singles 81 Canada RPM Adult Contemporary 22 US Billboard Hot 100 68 US Billboard Adult Contemporary 9 ==Other cover versions== *"I Believe You" was also featured on the 1978 album Moods by Barbara Mandrell. ==References== Category:1977 songs Category:1977 singles Category:1978 singles Category:Dorothy Moore songs Category:The Carpenters songs Category:Malaco Records singles Category:A&M; Records singles

14986772	I Against I (band)	I Against I is a punk rock band from the Netherlands formerly signed to Epitaph Records. ==History== I Against I was formed by two childhood friends, Ronald van Maren and Jasper Blazer, in the mid-1990s in the Netherlands. Their name comes from the Bad Brains record, I Against I. They signed to Epitaph Records in 1996, the first European group to do so. An EP followed in 1997 and an album in 1998 called Headcleaner, which was recorded in "the Blastingroom" in Fort Collins, Colorado, the studio of Bill Stevenson of All. The group toured Europe and played South by Southwest in 1998. Their sophomore LP titled I'm a Fucked Up Dancer but My Moods Are Swinging followed on Epitaph in 1999, but was released only in Europe. During this time the group toured with, Down by Law, All, and played with several bands like Bad Religion, Pennywise, No Fun At All, Blink 182, Dog Eat Dog, Shelter and the Bouncing Souls. In 2002, the group left Epitaph and released five songs on a split with MadBones on Ammonia Records which was intended as a demo only, but the label liked the five songs enough to officially release them and send the band on tour in Italy, Germany and Belgium. Finally they released a self-titled LP in 2005 on Moondown Records, mixed once again by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore. In November 2008, the band announced that they are calling it quits because "time has come to pursue other things". They reformed in 2017. ==Members== *Ronald van Maren - vocals, guitar *Jasper Blazer - drums *Bob Hoorweg - bass, vocals ==Discography== *Top of the World EP (Epitaph Europe, 1997) *Headcleaner (Epitaph Records, 1998) *I'm a Fucked Up Dancer but My Moods Are Swinging (Epitaph Records, 1999) *Split Competition Vol. 2 (Ammonia Records, 2002) *I Against I (Moondown Records, 2005) *Small Waves (White Russian Records, 2018) ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Dutch punk rock groups

153767	I = PAT	thumb|Studying the impact of mining on environment and village community thumb|Pollution from a factory I = (PAT) is the mathematical notation of a formula put forward to describe the impact of human activity on the environment. :I = P × A × T The expression equates human impact on the environment to a function of three factors: population (P), affluence (A) and technology (T). It is similar in form to the Kaya identity which applies specifically to emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. The validity of expressing environmental impact as a simple product of independent factors, and the factors that should be included and their comparative importance, have been the subject of debate among environmentalists. In particular, some have drawn attention to potential inter-relationships among the three factors; and others have wished to stress other factors not included in the formula, such as political and social structures, and the scope for beneficial, as well as harmful, environmental actions. ==History== The equation was developed in 1970 during the course of a debate between Barry Commoner, Paul R. Ehrlich and John Holdren. Commoner argued that environmental impacts in the United States were caused primarily by changes in its production technology following World War II and focused on present-day deteriorating environmental conditions in the United States. Ehrlich and Holdren argued that all three factors were important but emphasized the role of human population growth, focusing on a broader scale, being less specific in space and time. —— The equation can aid in understanding some of the factors affecting human impacts on the environment, but it has also been cited as a basis for many of the dire environmental predictions of the 1970s by Paul Ehrlich, George Wald, Denis Hayes, Lester Brown, René Dubos, and Sidney Ripley that did not come to pass.R Bailey (2000) Earth day then and now, Reason 32(1), 18-28 Neal Koblitz classified equations of this type as "mathematical propaganda" and criticized Ehrlich's use of them in the media (e.g. on The Tonight Show) to sway the general public.N Koblitz (1981) "Mathematics as Propaganda", in Mathematics Tomorrow, ed. Lynn Steen, pp 111-120. ==The dependent variable: Impact== The variable "I" in the "I=PAT" equation represents environmental impact. The environment may be viewed as a self-regenerating system that can endure a certain level of impact. The maximum endurable impact is called the carrying capacity. As long as "I" is less than the carrying capacity the associated population, affluence, and technology that make up "I" can be perpetually endured. If "I" exceeds the carrying capacity, then the system is said to be in overshoot, which may only be a temporary state. Overshoot may degrade the ability of the environment to endure impact, therefore reducing the carrying capacity. Impact may be measured using ecological footprint analysis in units of global hectares (gha). Ecological footprint per capita is a measure of the quantity of Earth's biologically productive surface that is needed to regenerate the resources consumed per capita. Impact is modeled as the product of three terms, giving gha as a result. Population is expressed in human numbers; therefore affluence is measured in units of gha per capita. Technology is a unitless efficiency factor. ==The three factors== ===Population=== thumb|right|upright=1.5|Population (est.) 10,000 BC – 2000 AD In the I=PAT equation, the variable P represents the population of an area, such as the world. Since the rise of industrial societies, human population has been increasing exponentially. This has caused Thomas Malthus, Paul Ehrlich and many others to postulate that this growth would continue until checked by widespread hunger and famine (see Malthusian growth model). The United Nations project that world population will increase from 7.7 billion today (2019) to 9.8 billion in 2050 and about 11.2 billion in 2100. These projections take into consideration that population growth has slowed in recent years as women are having fewer children. This phenomenon is the result of demographic transition all over the world. Although the UN projects that human population may stabilize at around 11.2 billion in 2100, the I=PAT equation will continue to be relevant for the increasing human impact on the environment in the short to mid-term future. ====Environmental impacts of population==== Increased population increases humans' environmental impact in many ways, which include but are not limited to: * Increased land use - Results in habitat loss for other species * Increased resource use - Results in changes in land cover * Increased pollution - Can cause sickness and damages ecosystems *Increased climate change *Increased biodiversity loss ===Affluence=== The variable A in the I=PAT equation stands for affluence. It represents the average consumption of each person in the population. As the consumption of each person increases, the total environmental impact increases as well. A common proxy for measuring consumption is through GDP per capita. While GDP per capita measures production, it is often assumed that consumption increases when production increases. GDP per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the I=PAT equation. ====Environmental impacts of affluence==== Increased consumption significantly increases human environmental impact. This is because each product consumed has wide-ranging effects on the environment. For example, the construction of a car has the following environmental impacts: * 605,664 gallons of water for parts and tires; * 682 lbs. of pollution at a mine for the lead battery; * 2178 lbs. of discharge into water supply for the 22 lbs. of copper contained in the car. The more cars per capita, the greater the impact. Ecological impacts of each product are far-reaching; increases in consumption quickly result in large impacts on the environment through direct and indirect sources. ===Technology=== The T variable in the I=PAT equation represents how resource intensive the production of affluence is; how much environmental impact is involved in creating, transporting and disposing of the goods, services and amenities used. Improvements in efficiency can reduce resource intensiveness, reducing the T multiplier. Since technology can affect environmental impact in many different ways, the unit for T is often tailored for the situation to which I=PAT is being applied. For example, for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured, an appropriate unit for T might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP. ====Environmental impacts of technology==== Increases in efficiency from technologies can reduce specific environmental impacts, but due to increasing prosperity these technologies yield for the people and businesses that adopt them, technologies actually end up generating greater overall growth into the resources that sustain us. ==Criticism== thumb|Native American fishing practices (low technology) have a vastly smaller impact than industrialized fishing. Criticisms of the I=PAT formula: * Too simplistic for complex problem * Interdependencies between variables * General sweeping assumptions of variables’ effect toward environmental impact * Cultural differences cause wide variation in impact * Technology cannot properly be expressed in a unit. Varying the unit will prove to be inaccurate, as the result of the calculation depends on one’s view of the situation. ===Interdependencies=== The I=PAT equation has been criticized for being too simplistic by assuming that P, A, and T are independent of each other. In reality, at least seven interdependencies between P, A, and T could exist, indicating that it is more correct to rewrite the equation as I = f(P,A,T). For example, a doubling of technological efficiency, or equivalently a reduction of the T-factor by 50%, does not necessarily reduce the environmental impact (I) by 50% if efficiency induced price reductions stimulate additional consumption of the resource that was supposed to be conserved, a phenomenon called the rebound effect (conservation) or Jevons Paradox. As was shown by Alcott, despite significant improvements in the carbon intensity of GDP (i.e., the efficiency in carbon use) since 1980, world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of energy and material use were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment, Chapter 5, "In Search of Solutions II: Efficiency Improvements", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, , 464 pp.≥ ===Neglect of beneficial human impacts=== There have also been comments that this model depicts people as being purely detrimental to the environment, ignoring any conservation or restoration efforts that societies have made. ===Neglect of political and social contexts=== Another major criticism of the I=PAT model is that it ignores the political context and decision-making structures of countries and groups. This means the equation does not account for varying degrees of power, influence, and responsibility of individuals over environmental impact. Also, the P factor does not account for the complexity of social structures or behaviors, resulting in blame being placed on the global poor. I=PAT does not account for sustainable resource use among some poor and indigenous populations, unfairly characterizing these populations whose cultures support low-impact practices. However, it has been argued that the latter criticism not only assumes low impacts for indigenous populations, but also misunderstands the I=PAT equation itself. Environmental impact is a function of human numbers, affluence (i.e., resources consumed per capita) and technology. It is assumed that small-scale societies have low environmental impacts due to their practices and orientations alone but there is little evidence to support this. In fact, the generally low impact of small-scale societies compared to state societies is due to a combination of their small numbers and low-level technology. Thus, the environmental sustainability of these societies is largely an epiphenomenon due their inability to significantly affect their environment. That all types of societies are subject to I=PAT was actually made clear in Ehrlich and Holdren's 1972 dialogue with Commoner in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, where they examine the pre-industrial (and indeed prehistoric) impact of human beings on the environment. Their position is further clarified by Holdren's 1993 paper, A Brief History of "IPAT". ===Policy implications=== As a result of the interdependencies between P, A, and T and potential rebound effects, policies aimed at decreasing environmental impacts through reductions in P, A, and T may not only be very difficult to implement (e.g., population control and material sufficiency and degrowth movements have been controversial) but also are likely to be rather ineffective compared to rationing (i.e., quotas) or Pigouvian taxation of resource use or pollution. ==See also== * Affluence * Carbon footprint * Eco-economic decoupling * Ecological footprint * Ecological indicator * Embodied energy * Kaya identity * Life cycle assessment * Population growth * Sustainability measurement * Sustainability metrics and indices * Technology * Water footprint ==References== Category:Human impact on the environment Category:Environmental social science concepts Category:Equations Category:Human geography Category:Technology assessment Category:Population ecology
15418318	I Could Fall in Love	"I Could Fall in Love" is a song recorded by American Tejano singer Selena for her fifth studio album, Dreaming of You (1995), released posthumously by EMI Latin on 15 June 1995. "I Could Fall in Love" and "Tú Sólo Tú" were the album's lead promotional recordings and her first English language songs to be featured as singles, showcasing her musical transition from Spanish-language to English-language songs. The lyrics explore feelings of heartbreak and despair and express the singer's fear of rejection by a man she finds herself falling in love with. Composed by Keith Thomas, "I Could Fall in Love" is a pop ballad with R&B;, soul and soft rock influences. Critics praised Selena's emotive enunciation and compared it to work by Celine Dion, Brandy Norwood and TLC. It received the Tejano Music Award for the Tejano Crossover Song of the Year, and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized it at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards as one of the most performed songs of 1995. Because of the recording's composition structure and the singer's vocalization, OC Weekly, BuzzFeed, Neon Tommy, and Latina magazine, believed "I Could Fall in Love" was one of the best songs recorded by Selena in her musical career. The track was not released as a commercial single in the United States, where it was feared that it might sell more copies than the album itself. "I Could Fall in Love" peaked at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart, and at number one on the Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary chart. It reached the top ten on the singles charts of Canada and New Zealand. It became the most played song in Kansas City, Miami, and Boston and the second most played in Los Angeles. The accompanying music video, directed by Hector Galan, featured a montage of pictures and videos of live performances of Selena, which had been collected by her family. It, too, was released posthumously, and it received a Music Video of the Year nomination at the 1996 Tejano Music Awards. "I Could Fall in Love" became one of Selena's most famous and recognizable recordings, and in the 1990s it became a popular wedding song. Cover versions include recordings by Adrienne Bailon, Jennifer Lopez, Gloria Estefan, Lisa Leuschner, Solange Knowles and Papushi. == Background and release == Before Selena signed a recording contract in 1989 with EMI Latin, she had hinted that she wanted to start recording in English. She was asked to make three demonstration recordings for Charles Koppelman, chairman of EMI Records. After reviewing them, Koppelman declined a crossover attempt, believing that Selena should first strengthen her fan base. Later, after releasing five Spanish-language albums that all achieved unprecedented milestones in the Latin music industry, Koppelman considered that Selena had reached her peak in the Spanish market, and he began preparations for a crossover album. Selena and her record-producer brother A.B. Quintanilla III arrived in Nashville, Tennessee, intending to collaborate with producer- songwriter Keith Thomas. Thomas had prepared the instrumental parts for "I Could Fall in Love" but had not had time to complete the vocal parts, so he sang it for them. Selena and A.B. immediately liked it, and A.B. said that he wanted Selena to include it in her album. She recorded it in December 1994 at The Bennett House in Franklin, Tennessee, and Bill Whittington mixed it with assistance from Mike Corbett and Todd Moore. Although Selena had to return later when Thomas was able to provide additional vocals, Selena's husband Chris Perez, who had overseen the recording sessions, said that the recording was completed on 25 March 1995. On 31 March 1995, Selena was murdered in Corpus Christi, Texas, by her friend and former employee Yolanda Saldívar. Thomas later announced that he had been working on another track for Selena to record, telling Biography that the track remained unfinished. "I Could Fall in Love" was released as the lead promotional recording for the 1995 album Dreaming of You on 26 June 1995, at the same time as "Tú Sólo Tú", to demonstrate Selena's transition from Spanish- to English-language recordings. "I Could Fall in Love" debuted on US radios on 15 June 1995 to contemporary hit radios, Top 40, urban AC and rhythmic contemporary airplay, while "Tú Sólo Tú" targeted Latin music radios such as Tejano, Latin pop, and regional Mexican airplay. An editor from the Arizona Daily Star believed "I Could Fall in Love" was targeted more towards adult contemporary radios than R&B; and top 40 radio formats that were successful for Gloria Estefan. "I Could Fall in Love" was released as a maxi single on 26 June 1995 in Australia and Mexico and on 10 August 1995 in Germany. A maxi single featuring "Dreaming of You" and "Sukiyaki" was released in Japan. "Tú Sólo Tú" was released primarily to Spanish-speaking countries. Fred Bronson of Billboard commented that if EMI Latin had released "I Could Fall in Love" as a single and it had debuted in the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, then it would have been the first posthumous debut single to do so since "Pledging My Love" by Johnny Ace in 1955. == Composition and lyrics == "I Could Fall in Love" is a mid-tempo pop ballad and R&B; song with soul and soft rock influences. Mario Tarradell, an editorial writer for The Dallas Morning News, called the song a "mundane ballad". It is set in common time and employs an electronic piano, drum machine, a violin, and a flute in the background. The instrumentation includes bass drum, keyboard, flamenco guitar, Spanish guitar, and synthesizers. "I Could Fall in Love" is written in the key of E major, to be played in a moderate groove at 78 half notes per minute. The vocal range of the melody extends from the note F3 to A4. Sandy Masuo of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote, "These songs ["I Could Fall in Love", "I'm Getting Used to You" and "Captive Heart"] were to be her armaments in the crossover war and, sure enough, they're catchy, state-of-the-art pop/R&B; – but, despite the sublime melody of "I Could Fall in Love", strikingly anonymous." An editor from the Contra Costa Times called the song a "jazzy ballad". Donny Brusca's book BPM List 2006: Main Edition classified it as "light-adult contemporary". Andrew Griffin of The Town Talk called it a "Tex-Mex (Texas-Mexico) pop" song. "I Could Fall in Love" is similar to "Dreaming of You" in its lyrics. Many media outlets, including the Milwaukee Journal and Billboard magazine, called them "confessional ballads",Citations: * * * with an emotionally vulnerable narrator who wants true love but finds it unattainable. Tarradell believed "I Could Fall in Love" was an indirect response to Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., who forced her and Perez to end their relationship just because Perez was a rocker. Tarradell asserted that the words "I know it's not right but I guess I should try to do what I should do" were directed at Abraham and reflected Selena's realization of her independence. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News believed that Selena's 1992 song "Missing My Baby" shared similarities with "I Could Fall in Love" in expressing uncontrollable "adrenalin-fueled love". Burr later wrote that the difference in "I Could Fall in Love" is that the lyrics are recorded with "powerful agony" which forces the narrator to "fall into a phase of deep loneliness" because her lover may or may not reciprocate her feelings. The first verse of "I Could Fall in Love" implores the object of the singer's desire to walk away, because her emotions are too overpowering and she feels love of unprecedented intensity. She fears that by allowing him to stay attached, she may "lose control". Selena believes that her infatuation can lead to romantic love. She then sings "I could fall in love (in love) with you" before wondering how she would feel if she were to touch him for the first time. The fear of being rejected and unloved leads her to keep her feelings to herself, and she begins to believe that her love is "not right". She continues, "and I guess I should try / to do what I should do / but I could fall in love / fall in love with you". During the midpoint break, Selena sings in Spanish that she is always dreaming about him, imagining that he loves her. She sings the chorus twice before the song comes to an end without her ever having come to terms with her loved one. == Critical reception == "I Could Fall in Love" received a generally positive response from music critics, who commented on its similarities to songs recorded by other artists. Ed Morales of Vibe magazine felt that, because of its syncopated drums, "I Could Fall in Love" had a "Jon Secada-like feel", and it reminded Tarradell of songs recorded by American singer Brandy Norwood and by the trio TLC. An editor from the Star- News thought the song had "a whiff of" Celine Dion. James Hunter, also from Vibe, praised Selena's astute interpretation, calling it a "masterpiece" and commenting that Selena's death made the track more difficult to listen to. Larry Flick of Billboard described "I Could Fall in Love" as an "optimistic love song" that left "melancholy thoughts of what might have been" in the mind of the listener. John Lannert, also from Billboard, conceived "I Could Fall in Love" as a "sensuous narrative" recording and a "seductive romantic confessional". Tarradell, writing in The Beaver County Times, called it a "crossover staple". Mary Talbot of the New York Daily News, praised Selena's "soft, velvety voice". A San Jose Mercury News reporter wrote that "I Could Fall in Love" and "Dreaming of You" helped Selena to become "the new Gloria Estefan". Richard Torres of Newsday considered both these songs to be romantic anthems. Enrique Fernandez of the Sun Sentinel described "I Could Fall in Love" as "beautiful", while an editor from The Sacramento Bee called the song a "Latin-influenced R&B; lite". Because of its "overly simplistic and repetitive lyrics", Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News assessed "I Could Fall in Love" as the "weakest track" of Dreaming of You. Elizabeth Rodriguez Kessler and Anne Perrin wrote in their 2007 book Chican@s in the Conversations that "I Could Fall in Love" was a "clean pop offering". Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle commented in 2008 that it had "made the Tejano goddess a posthumous crossover star". On 31 March 2010, Teresa Jusino of Popmatters expressed the view that English-speaking music fans no longer remember Selena's name, saying that on playing "Dreaming of You" or "I Could Fall in Love", many would say "I remember that song!" or "I love that one!". Randi Bergman of Fashion magazine, called the number an "epic ballad". == Recognition and accolades == "I Could Fall in Love" was nominated for "Song of the Year" at the 1996 Tejano Music Awards, and won the Tejano Crossover Songs of the Year. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 1995 at the 4th ASCAP Pop Music Awards. Marco Torres of OC Weekly, called the song "so sweet, so loving, so absolutely, amazingly, and astonishingly adorable!" and placed it at number seven on his "Top 10 Selena songs of All time" list. Brian Galindo of BuzzFeed believed the "melancholy ballad is another great example of Selena's ability bring an emotional vulnerability to her songs." and placed "I Could Fall in Love" at number five on his list of "The 15 Greatest Selena Songs of All Time". Latina magazine placed "I Could Fall in Love" at number three on their "Remembering Selena: Her Top Ten Songs" list. Ashley Velez of Neon Tommy commented that "Selena lends her vulnerability to this slow ballad" and that it "displays Selena's talented vocals and helped introduce the singer to the American mainstream." Velez then ranked the recording number two on her list of the "Top 5 Selena Songs". == Chart performance == Davitt Sigerson, the president and CEO of EMI records, feared that "I Could Fall in Love" might sell more copies than the album itself, so he did not issue the single as a commercial release. Therefore, it was not eligible for the Billboard Hot 100 chart. "I Could Fall in Love" debuted at number four on the Hot Latin Tracks chart on 1 July 1995 and peaked at number two the following week, becoming the highest-ever English-language song on that chart. "Tú Sólo Tú" and "I Could Fall in Love" occupied the first and second positions respectively on Hot Latin Tracks for five consecutive weeks. Selena thus became the first artist to place both a Spanish- and an English-language song in the top ten of the Hot Latin Tracks chart. "I Could Fall in Love" became the fifth best-charting song from that chart in 1995 and remained the highest-charting English- language song for two years, until Celine Dion's 1998 single "My Heart Will Go On" surpassed it when it peaked at number one. It also reached number-one on the Billboard Latin Pop Airplay chart. "I Could Fall in Love" debuted at number 46 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart issue dated 8 July 1995 and peaked eight weeks later at number 8 on 2 September 1995. By entering the Adult Contemporary Tracks chart at number 37 on 29 July 1995, the recording received a "Hot Shot Debut" as the highest debut of the week. It ran at number 14 for three consecutive weeks starting on 21 October 1995. "I Could Fall in Love" peaked at number 17 on the Adult Top 40 chart and number three on the Hot 100 Recurrent Airplay chart on 23 December 1995. The performance entered the Hot Adult Contemporary Recurrent chart on 27 January 1996 at number six and achieved the same on the Rhythmic Top 40. Number 15 was its highest position on the Mainstream Top 40 chart. In New Zealand, "I Could Fall in Love" debuted at number 36 on the New Zealand Singles Chart on 10 October 1995 and peaked at number ten in the week ending 19 November 1995, its fifth week on the chart. In Canada, "I Could Fall in Love" debuted at number 55 on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart of 24 July 1995. By 30 October it had reached number one. On 21 August 1995 it entered at number 94 on the RPM Top Singles chart, and in October, after eleven weeks, it reached number ten for two consecutive weeks. == Music video == Directed by Hector Galan, the song's accompanying music video featured a montage of pictures and videos of live performances by Selena that had been collected by her family. It was released posthumously and received a Music Video of the Year nomination at the 1995 Tejano Music Awards. This promotional video reached number 11 on the Billboard Video Monitor VH1 Top Music Videos list, number 6 on The BOX Video List, number 10 on the MOR Music list, and number 3 on the California Music Channel (CMC) list of most popular music videos. == Cultural impact == "I Could Fall in Love" dominated the Top 40 radio stations, a fact that was well received by critics. The song was given heavy rotation in the southern United States, becoming the most played song in Kansas City, Miami, and Boston and the second most played in Los Angeles. In Tucson, Arizona, it was played every 2½ hours, and in San Antonio every hour. The song was played 25 times its first day of availability on US radios on the Harlingen, Texas radio station KBTQ. It helped increase Selena's catalogue sales and simultaneously boosted media attention. The song's release sparked a two-day "on-air blitz" on radios in South Texas. In Riverside, California, program directors reported that "I Could Fall in Love" was one of the three hits they were playing most often on their radio stations. A San Antonio disc jockey told The Victoria Advocate about the overwhelming response received from the English-speaking audience, who were constantly calling her radio station asking for "I Could Fall in Love". "Dreaming of You" and "I Could Fall in Love" were EMI Records' top selling digital downloads from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005. "I Could Fall in Love" became one of Selena's most widely recognized recordings. It rapidly became popular as a wedding song, causing it to become one of Selena's most famous songs. Her English-speaking audience increased substantially as a result of its widespread popularity. Amanda Edwards of Voxxi.com called it "one of the most popular Latin love songs of all time", adding that, "from her sweet voice to the genuine sentiment of the song (with a hint of sexiness if you're listening carefully), we're sold on this track being a solid standby any time of year but especially for someone hoping for romance on Valentine's Day". === Covers === A number of singers have adapted the song in a variety of genres. Puerto Rican-American singer and actress Jennifer Lopez lip-synced the track for her portrayal of the title role in the 1997 biographical film Selena, which was praised by critics. Reviewing the film's opening, a Wichita Eagle writer described the song as "hauntingly lovely" and said that it expressed the feelings of Selena's fans. Lopez included "I Could Fall in Love" in the set list for her Lets Get Loud Tour in 2001 at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and on 11 February 2003 she included the song in her live video album Jennifer Lopez: Let's Get Loud. Cuban singer Gloria Estefan performed a cover version during the Selena ¡VIVE! concert in 2005; Tarradell commented in The Dallas Morning News that it had been a "lovely rendition". Puerto Rican singer Ana recorded the song for her album Amor Latino. The Korean singer Im Tae Kyung performed a slower pop ballad version that incorporates a guitar as its musical foundation. A reggae-inspired version of the song appeared on Fiona's Best of Sweet Love. Season three American Idol contestant Lisa Leuschner included the song in her album Reality. In Kumbia Kings' third compilation album Duetos (2005), Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla III recorded "I Could Fall in Love" as a Spanglish duet with Selena. For the album Familia RMM Recordando a Selena, recorded by various artists in 1996, Los Jovenes Del Barrio performed a cover of the song. Season 10 American Idol contestant Karen Rodriguez performed "I Could Fall in Love" during the "top 13" episode, receiving unfavorable reviews from critics who considered the song too powerful for her. However, The Washington Post contributor Derrik Lang called Rodriguez' cover a "breathy redemption". American Idol alumna Katie Stevens wrote to The Hollywood Reporter, claiming that the judges on the show had judged Rodriguez too harshly and calling Rodriguez the "new Selena". Rodriguez recorded a studio version of "I Could Fall in Love" in 2011 for her debut album, which was produced by Jim Jonsin. Solange Knowles included the song in the set list for her 2013 world tour, which has received praise from music critics. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle wrote that Knowles had "put a lovely, downtempo twist on 'I Could Fall in Love". Michael O'Connell of The Hollywood Reporter called Knowles' rendition a "fangirl cover". Writing in the San Francisco Weekly, Erin Browner considered Knowles' cover the "highlight of the night" when she performed it at the start of her US tour. Browner commented that the "combination of sexy Solange and Selena's epic love song was almost too much for the audience to handle" and that "people immediately whipped out their phones to record (yep, it's already on YouTube) and/or just plain cried the lyrics along with her". On 29 March 2015, Filipino singers Angeline Quinto, Yeng Constantino, and Juris Fernandez performed "I Could Fall in Love" for the variety show ASAP. American singer Adrienne Bailon performed "I Could Fall in Love" after a six- year departure from the music business, during 31 March 2015 episode of The Real; a talk show she co-hosted from 2013 to 2022. == Formats and track listings == * Worldwide Promotional Recording # "I Could Fall in Love (Album version)" – 4:40 # "I Could Fall in Love (Softer version)" – 4:41 * Japan maxi single # "I Could Fall in Love" – 4:41 # "Dreaming of You" – 5:15 # "Sukiyaki" – 3:01 * Mexican CD single # "I Could Fall in Love (Album version)" – 4:40 # "I Could Fall in Love (Softer version)" – 4:41 # "Tú Sólo Tú" – 3:12 * Australian maxi single # "I Could Fall in Love (Album version)" – 4:40 # "I Could Fall in Love (Softer version)" – 4:41 # "Tú Sólo Tú" – 3:45 # "Amor Prohibido" – 2:50 == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from Dreaming of You album liner notes. * Keith Thomas — producer, arranger, synthesizer, bass programming * Selena — lead vocals, backing vocals * Bill Whittington — vocals recorder, mixer * Mike Corbett — assistant engineer * Todd Moore — production coordinator * Mark Hammond — drums * Tommy Sims — bass guitar * Dann Huff — acoustic guitars * Trey Lorenz — backing vocals == Charts == === Weekly charts === Weekly chart performance for "I Could Fall in Love" Chart (1995) Peak position Australia (ARIA) 60 El Salvador (UPI) 3 Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40) 11 Panama (UPI) 5 US Rhythmic Top 40 (Billboard) 5 US Top 40 Mainstream (Billboard) 15 === Year-end charts === Year-end chart performance for "I Could Fall in Love" Chart (1995) Position Canada Top Singles (RPM) 93 Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) 9 US Adult Contemporary (Billboard) 39 US Hot Latin Tracks (Billboard) 5 US Radio Songs (Billboard) 41 ==Certifications== == Release and radio history == Release dates and formats for "I Could Fall in Love" Country Date Format Label Ref.

15489362	I Can Do Without You	"I Can Do Without You" is a popular song, with music by Sammy Fain and lyrics by Paul Francis Webster. The song was included in the 1953 film, Calamity Jane. It was performed by Doris Day and Howard Keel. Doris Day played the lead in the film as Calamity Jane, while Howard Keel played her nemesis and eventual love interest, Bill Hickok. The song proceeds from a scene in which Calamity is thrown off-kilter by apparent praise from Hickok after she promises to bring the actress Adelaid Adams from Chicago to Deadwood City. It turns out that Hickok was being sarcastic and that he trusts her "about as much as I do a blind rattlesnake with a new button on its tail." The song is a comical male-female quarrel, with Calamity and Hickok exchanging comic insults, somewhat reminiscent of "Anything You Can Do" from Annie Get Your Gun. ==External links== * * IMDB Category:1953 songs Category:Doris Day songs Category:Songs with music by Sammy Fain Category:Songs with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster Category:Songs written for films

According to the inside cover, the stories concern The Cat in the Hat's son, daughter, and great-great-grandfather (as identified in the book's endpapers). The title story concerns The Cat in the Hat's son, who brags that he can fight 30 tigers and win. He makes excuse after excuse, finally disqualifying all the tigers until he must fight no tigers at all. The illustrations are notable for their use of gouache and brush strokes rather than the usual pen and ink. Others stories include "King Looie Katz", another warning against hierarchical society advocating self- reliance, and "The Glunk That Got Thunk" about the power of run-away imagination. Illustrations for "The Glunk That Got Thunk" make great use of wavy line crosshatching. For example, I Can Lick 30 Tigers Today! and Other Stories is read by American actor Tom Hanks. == I Can Lick 30 Tigers Today == The Cat in the Hat's son goes outside bragging to himself that he can fight thirty tigers and win. Upon hearing this, thirty tigers step forward to call his bluff, but seeing that he's outnumbered and outsized, the Cat's son begins making up excuses to reduce the number of tigers for various reasons (one having curly hair, nine having dirty fingernails, five being underweight, five looking sleepy, and two looking hot) with the exception of seven being dismissed without any reason. With the number now reduced to just one tiger, the Cat's son instead decides to back out of the would be fight with the excuse that lunchtime has come up. == King Looie Katz == In the year 139, the Cat in the Hat's great-great grandfather Looie is the King of Katzen-stein. King Looie is very proud of his tail and prefers that it never drag behind him, so he has it cleaned in the morning and arranges for Fooie Katz to be his helper and hold up his tail to prevent it from dragging. However, when Fooie sees that his own tail is dragging, he decides that what's good enough for the king is good enough for him too, so he hires Kooie Katz to hold up his tail. The process, however, ends up repeating itself until all the cats in Katzen- stein are holding up each other's tails except for Zooie Katzen-bein, who is now the only cat without anybody to hold up his own tail. Finally fed up with being the only cat to have his tail dragging, Zooie slams down Prooie Katz's tail in frustration, which makes the other cats do the same thing until Fooie slams down King Looie's tail. From that day on, King Looie and all the other cats act "demo-catic" by holding up their own tails themselves. == The Glunk That Got Thunk == The Cat in the Hat's daughter engages in an after-dinner hobby of sitting in her room to use her "Thinker-Upper" to think up friendly little furry things and use her "UN-Thinker" to "un-think" them away when she's done. One evening, while thinking up friendly little furry things as usual, the Cat's daughter decides that she can think up bigger things, but in increasing her Thinker-Upper's power, it ends up creating a Glunk, a big green furry creature, that breaks out of her dream cloud. Seeing what she's done, the Cat's daughter tries to Un-Think the Glunk away, but the Glunk doesn't go away, to which he explains that Glunks can't be "Un-Thunked" once they've been "thunked" up. To the Cat's daughter's dismay, the Glunk then proceeds to the living room to use the telephone to make a 9,000 mile long distance call to his mother (something he does every night, not even caring how expensive the phone bill gets). Despite the Cat's daughter's warning that the telephone company charges an expensive fee for long distance calls, the Glunk calls up his mother and talks nonstop about "Glunker" Stew, a recipe he just cooked up that day. The Cat's daughter's attempts to get the Glunk off the phone are only met with scoffing and a kick in the shin, leaving her to become more and more desperate to get rid of him when the Glunk has talked up to $300 for two whole hours. Hearing the racket, the Cat's son comes into the living room to find the Glunk still blabbering into the phone and his little sister trying again at trying to Un-Think the Glunk, so far without success. Seeing that she needs help, the Cat's son turns on his UN-Thinker as well and, together, both of them successfully Un-Think the Glunk away (revealing that the Glunk's earlier explanation to the Cat's daughter never revealed that Glunks can only be Un-Thunked away if more than one person is doing it). After that, the Cat's son gives his little sister a very stern lecture about proper use of her Thinker-Upper and from that night on, the Cat's daughter sticks to using her Thinker-Upper to only thinking up friendly little furry things. ==See also== * The Cat in the Hat, original 1957 book ==References== Category:1969 short story collections Category:1969 children's books Category:American picture books Category:Books by Dr. Seuss Category:Children's books about cats Category:Children's books about tigers Category:The Cat in the Hat Category:Random House books
1581631	I Am Shelby Lynne	I Am Shelby Lynne is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter Shelby Lynne, released on April 10, 1999, in the United Kingdom and on January 25, 2000, in the United States. After several years of lackluster results from recording various styles of country music in and around Nashville, Lynne co- wrote and recorded this album in Palm Springs, California, incorporating confessional lyrics with musical elements from blues and rock and roll. Lynne collaborated on this album with producer Bill Bottrell, who had previously worked with Sheryl Crow on her debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club. The album is considered to be Lynne's breakout work, and the catalyst toward her receiving her first career Grammy award as Best New Artist of 2000. The award came more than a decade after Lynne's debut album, 1989's Sunrise. ==Reception== Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the album as a sign of Lynne's reinvention of herself as a "tough and sexy singer", comparing her to Bonnie Raitt and Sheryl Crow. He praised Bill Bottrell's production of the album and said that Lynne "finally sounds comfortable in her writing and voice", and that with this album, she has "finally [found] her groove". Rolling Stone's Parke Puterbaugh said that the album had more jazz and soul about it than country, but that it had "a genuine evocation of country". He said that the tracks "[seduce] you ... rather than bowling you over". He praised Lynne's harmonies, calling them "nothing less than righteous." ==Track listing== #"Your Lies" (Bill Bottrell, Shelby Lynne) — 2:54 #"Leavin'" (Lynne) — 3:11 #"Life Is Bad" (Bottrell, Roger Fritz, Lynne) — 3:18 #"Thought It Would Be Easier" (Bottrell, Lynne) — 3:55 #"Gotta Get Back" (Bottrell, Lynne, Dorothy Overstreet) — 3:37 #"Why Can't You Be?"

1593267	I Am One	"I Am One" is the debut single by American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins. It was the band's first ever release and remains the only single issued by the band with co-writing credits to both Billy Corgan and James Iha. It charted on the UK Singles Chart at a peak position of number 73. Two recordings of the song were released. One was recorded in 1990 and was the Pumpkins' first release and first on Limited Potential. This recording was financed with the money from Corgan's college tuition fund left by his grandmother.Fricke, David. "Smashing Pumpkins Look Back in Wonder ". Rolling Stone Magazine. December 20, 2000. "I Am One" was re-recorded for Gish and a new single was released on Caroline Records and Hut Recordings. Corgan later stated his regret with not re-working the song for Gish, as the two versions are nearly identical. A video for the song was also filmed, but never released (until 2001) due to the band being unhappy with the result. Footage from the video was instead used on the long form video, Vieuphoria, the long version of the music video was released on the Greatest Hits Video Collection. With only 1500 copies pressed, the release is highly sought after by collectors. There are apparently three test pressings also in existence, two owned by Billy Corgan and one was formally owned by Limited Potential owner, Mike Potential. "I Am One" features a doubled guitar solo – a technique later used on Pumpkins songs like "Ava Adore", "Tarantula", and "Bring the Light". The music video features a live performance by the band. == Performance == In live performance (starting around the release of Siamese Dream) Corgan would often improvise a speech during the extended bass break; as a result the song could extend to 8–10 minutes in length. The speech section is known among fans as "the I Am One rant". These rants were criticized, sometimes even by the other band members, due to their abrasive nature. Jimmy Chamberlin considered these rants to be "art-breakdown". The rants were apparently based around the erosion of the belief structure in America's youth, and Corgan has stated they were the gestation for many ideas he later explored on Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Some of the rants contained lyrics for future songs, most notably "Zero". The recording of "I Am One" on Vieuphoria / Earphoria features one such rant. When the band released their greatest hits compilation, Rotten Apples, in 2001, "I Am One" was one of the few singles that did not make the cut (the others were "Tristessa", "Rocket", "Thirty-Three", "The End Is the Beginning Is the End", and on American copies of the album, "Try, Try, Try"). == Track listing == == Single personnel == === The Smashing Pumpkins === * Billy Corgan – vocals, guitar, production * James Iha (as "James" on Limited Potential) – guitar, photography (Gish version) * D'arcy Wretzky – bass guitar * Jimmy Chamberlin – drums === Technical personnel === * Kerry Brown – production, CD single b-sides * Butch Vig – production, Gish version * Lynne Fischer – design, photography (Limited Potential) == References == == External links == * * Music video Category:1990 debut singles Category:The Smashing Pumpkins songs Category:1992 singles Category:Songs written by James Iha Category:Songs written by Billy Corgan Category:Song recordings produced by Billy Corgan Category:Song recordings produced by Butch Vig Category:Virgin Records singles Category:Music videos directed by Kevin Kerslake Category:1990 songs
16236794	I Ain't Never	"I Ain't Never" is a song co-written by American country music artists Webb Pierce and Mel Tillis. Each co-writer recorded the song separately, with both Pierce's (1959), and years later Tillis's (1972), versions resulting in major hits. ==Background== According to Tillis, he wrote the song himself, and agreed to credit Pierce as a co-writer in exchange for a pair of boots Pierce was wearing when Tillis pitched him the song. In Tillis's words, "Them old boots cost me over eight hundred thousand dollars" in royalties.Ralph Emery's Country Legends Volume 2 DVD It Is Rumored, this song was originally written by Jerry Leen Richards, and Webb stole the song for himself. ==Chart performance== Pierce's version was released in 1959, eventually spending nine weeks at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot C&W; Sides chart that year (held out by "The Three Bells (Les Trois Cloches)" by The Browns). The pop market accepted the Webb Pierce version, crossing it into the Billboard Top 40 and peaking at #24. ===Webb Pierce=== Chart (1959) Peak position ===Mel Tillis=== Tillis's 1972 recording of the song was his first No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles (now Hot Country Songs) charts.

1627533	I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)	"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)" is a 1965 hit song recorded by the Four Tops for the Motown label. Written and produced by Motown's main production team Holland–Dozier–Holland, "I Can't Help Myself" is one of the most well-known Motown recordings of the 1960s and among the decade's biggest hits. The single topped the Billboard's R&B; chart for nine weeks (being named the biggest R&B; single of the year by Billboard) and also peaked at number one on the Hot 100 for two non-consecutive weeks, from June 12 to June 19 and from June 26 to July 3 in 1965. It replaced "Back in My Arms Again" by labelmates The Supremes. It was first unseated at number one by "Mr. Tambourine Man" by The Byrds, then regained the top spot before being replaced by the Rolling Stones blockbuster "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". Billboard ranked the record as the second biggest single of 1965. "I Can't Help Myself" was the Four Tops' first Top 40 single in the UK, peaking at 23 in the summer of 1965, then reaching 10 on its spring 1970 re-release. The song finds lead singer Levi Stubbs, assisted by the other three Tops and The Andantes, pleadingly professing his love to a woman: "Sugar pie, honey bunch/I'm weaker than a man should be!/Can't help myself/I'm a fool in love, you see." The melodic and chordal progressions are very similar to the Supremes' 1964 hit "Where Did Our Love Go," also written by Holland-Dozier-Holland. According to Allmusic critic Ed Hogan, the title "I Can't Help Myself" is an oblique acknowledgment by Dozier that he could not resist recycling his previous hit. The bracketed title 'Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch' appears only on certain oldie reissues of the single. Billboard described the song as a "spirited, fast- paced wailer performed in [the Four Tops'] unique style." Cash Box described it as "a rollicking hand-clappin' thumper about a fella who is delighted 'cause he's head-over-heels with the gal of his dreams." Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song #483 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It has been covered extensively since 1965, including versions done for several television commercials. In 2019, Applebee's used the song for one of their advertisements. ==Personnel== * Lead vocals by Levi Stubbs * Background Vocals by Abdul "Duke" Fakir, Renaldo "Obie" Benson, Lawrence Payton, and The Andantes: Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow, and Louvain Demps * Instrumentation by The Funk Brothers and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra (strings) **Bass by James JamersonLiner notes.

Their backing band, The Funk Brothers, was also the Four Tops' backing band at the time and comprising most, if not all, of the same musicians as on the original number- one single. In 1967, the Four Tops themselves recorded a special Italian language version, entitled Piangono gli uomini (The men cry). In the winter of 1969, Johnny Rivers covered the song. His rendition became a number-two hit in South Africa. Donnie Elbert hit number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1972 with his cover of this song, which was a follow-up to his cover of the Supremes' "Where Did Our Love Go." In Canada, it reached number 37. In 1980, Bonnie Pointer had a disco crossover hit, with the song peaking at number 40 on the pop singles chart, number 42 on the soul singles chart, and number four on the dance chart. In Canada, it reached number 43 on the Top 100 Singles chart. The song also peaked at number 52 in Australia. A cover by American country music group Billy Hill peaked at number 58 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1989. In 1992, Australian girl group Teen Queens released a version that peaked at number 28 on the Australian Singles Chart. The "Motorcity All-Stars" released a rerecorded version of song in 1989 on Ian Levine's Motown revival label Motorcity. The ensemble group was put together from as many former Motown singers as producer Levine could assemble. Levi Stubbs's brother Joe called Levi over to record the song, and both brothers feature on the track, along with singers Sammy Ward, Cal Gill of The Velvelettes, and Carolyn Crawford and C.P. Spencer of The Originals, all of whom had previously recorded at Motown. Many other former Motown associates can be seen in the background of the accompanying video, including Berry Gordy's ex-wife Raynoma Gordy Singleton and former head of artist development Maxine Powell. American musician Kid Rock has performed the song in concert on his 2013 tour. He later included a cover of the song on his 2017 album Sweet Southern Sugar. On the album it was titled "Sugar Pie Honey Bunch". == La Toya Jackson version == "I Can't Help Myself" is a 1995 single by American singer La Toya Jackson, taken from her album Stop in the Name of Love, released by KOCH International. The single's B-side, a cover of the Supremes' "Baby Love", is also taken from the album. === Track list === ==References== Category:1965 singles Category:1980 singles Category:Four Tops songs Category:Bonnie Pointer songs Category:Billy Hill (band) songs Category:Irma Thomas songs Category:Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles Category:Cashbox number-one singles Category:Songs written by Holland–Dozier–Holland Category:Dance-pop songs Category:Motown singles Category:Song recordings produced by Brian Holland Category:Song recordings produced by Lamont Dozier Category:1965 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Jeffrey Bowen Category:Johnny Rivers songs

16296750	I Can Love You Like That	"I Can Love You Like That" is a song written by Steve Diamond, Jennifer Kimball and Maribeth Derry, and recorded by American country music singer John Michael Montgomery. It was released in February 1995 as the first single from his self-titled CD. The song reached the top of the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. ==Music video== The accompanying music video was directed by Marc Ball and premiered in early 1995. The video features a wedding, with John Michael Montgomery singing. ==Chart performance== The song debuted at number 59 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart dated March 4, 1995. It charted for twenty weeks and went to Number One on the chart dated April 22, 1995, and stayed there for one week before being replaced by Brooks & Dunn's "Little Miss Honky Tonk" the next week. However, it did go back to Number One on the chart dated May 6, 1995, where it stayed for two more weeks. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1995) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1995) Position Canada Country Tracks (RPM) 79 US Country Songs (Billboard) 5 ==All-4-One version== Two months after Montgomery's version reached number one, American male R&B; and pop group All-4-One released their version, and it reached a peak of number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1995. It was produced by David Foster, selling 600,000 copies domestically and being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Despite a live performance on the BBC's long- running music programme Top of the Pops, it only peaked at number 33 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's last top-40 entry there. ===Critical reception=== Steve Baltin from Cash Box wrote, "All-4-One had one of the biggest hits of last year with the chart-topping "I Swear". The first single from their forthcoming And The Music Speaks album continues the remarkably middle-of-the-road sound they put forth last year. As a result, similar chart success is likely. Though appeal of the same magnitude might be harder to achieve. Simple and Wonder Bread white, “I Can Love You Like That” is a huge ballad." ===Track listing=== * CD single – Europe (1995) # "I Can Love You Like That" (edit) – 3:51 # "All-4-1" – 5:24 # "I Can Love You Like That" (LP version) – 4:23 ===Charts=== ====Weekly charts==== Chart (1995–1996) Peak position Europe (European Dance Radio) 14 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 Tipparade) 16 Zimbabwe (ZIMA)* Zimbabwe.

1645600	I Care 4 U	I Care 4 U is a posthumous compilation album by American singer Aaliyah. It was released on December 10, 2002, by Blackground Records and Universal Records. Following Aaliyah's death on August 25, 2001, Blackground decided to release a posthumous record in collaboration with Universal Music Group. The album included some of Aaliyah's singles and previously unreleased recordings discarded from sessions for her eponymous third and final studio album (2001). I Care 4 U received mixed reviews from critics, based on the assessment of the previously unreleased songs and the compilation's breadth in general. Commercially, the album was a success, debuting at number three on the US Billboard 200 and being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also reached the top ten France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The album produced four singles—"Miss You", "Don't Know What to Tell Ya", "I Care 4 U", and "Come Over"—and has sold over six million copies worldwide. ==Background== Between October 2000 and February 2001, Aaliyah filmed her part in the vampire film Queen of the Damned (2002) in Melbourne, simultaneously recording what would become her eponymous third and final studio album. The album was released in July 2001 to widespread critical acclaim. It became a commercial success as well, debuting at number two on the US Billboard 200 and selling 187,000 copies in its first week; it marked the highest sales week of her career to that point. On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah and eight others were killed in a plane crash in The Bahamas after filming the music video for the single "Rock the Boat". The pilot Luis Morales III was unlicensed at the time of the accident and had traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system. Aaliyah's family later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Blackhawk International Airways, which was settled out of court. Following Aaliyah's death, Aaliyah reached the top of the Billboard 200, spending 69 weeks on the chart, and had sold 2.6 million copies in the United States by December 2009. ==Recording and production== I Care 4 U features both album cuts and previously-unreleased tracks and demos, recorded between 1993 and March 2001. The title track was written by Missy Elliott and Timbaland, who also produced the song, and was recorded at the Magic Mix Studios and Music Grinder Studios in Los Angeles in 2000. Aaliyah began to record the song for her second studio album One in a Million (1996), but it was completed after that album had finished post-production, thus she saved it for Aaliyah. Timbaland also wrote and produced "Don't Know What to Tell Ya", which was co-written by Static Major and recorded at the Manhattan Center Studios. Originally crafted for Ginuwine's second studio album 100% Ginuwine (1999), "Miss You" was written by Ginuwine, Johntá Austin and Teddy Bishop, while being produced by Bishop. In 1999, while Aaliyah was recording her eponymous third studio album (2001) at the Manhattan Center Studios, she requested Austin and Bishop to play her a couple of tracks they had produced with other artists, including "Miss You", for which Ginuwine had already lent his vocals. Bishop later commented: "She was like, 'I want to cut this record' [...] She got on the phone, called him and said 'Hey I know you cut this record already, but I would love to cut it'." Ginuwine allowed her to cut her own version of it and the same night, Aaliyah re-recorded the whole song. Though she reportedly wanted to put the song out herself, her label Blackground Records felt the song was no "smash record", thus it was left unused until after her death. "Come Over" was written by Johntá Austin, Bryan- Michael Cox, Kevin Hicks and Phalon "Jazze Pha" Alexander, while being produced by Cox, Hicks and Alexander. It was originally recorded for Aaliyah at the Sony Music Studios in New York City, but did not make the album's final cut. When the song was left unused, it was given to American duo Changing Faces, who included their version on their third studio album Visit Me (2000); however, Aaliyah's original version ended up being included on I Care 4 U. Altogether, Natalie Nichols from the Los Angeles Times categorized the albums material as a "minimalist blend of hip-hop, funk, soul and dance-music". ==Release and promotion== I Care 4 U was released in the United States on December 10, 2002, by Blackground Records and Universal Records, with its CD+DVD limited edition being released simultaneously. Internationally, it was released in both editions in early 2003. Its title track received heavy airplay throughout 2002, which helped promote the album, as well as the digital release of the lead single "Miss You" in October 2002 prior to it being serviced to US radio the following month. Upon the album's release, it was announced that a portion of its proceeds would go to the Aaliyah Memorial Fund. In August 2021, it was reported that the album and Aaliyah's other recorded work for Blackground (since rebranded as Blackground Records 2.0) would be re-released on physical, digital and, for the first time ever, streaming services, in a deal between the label and Empire Distribution, with I Care 4 U being reissued on October 8. The re-release was met with disdain from Aaliyah's estate, who issued a statement denouncing the "unscrupulous endeavor to release Aaliyah's music without any transparency or full accounting to the estate". I Care 4 U had earlier been released digitally, without permission from Blackground Records, by Craze Productions, using a scan of the international edition cover instead of its digital printing master and without any additional metadata. A lawsuit against Craze Productions was filed by Reservoir Media Management, a marketing partner of Blackground Records at the time, and the jury agreed with them in September 2015. Even after the ruling and the official 2021 reissue, the illegal edition is still available on digital and streaming services. ==Singles== "Miss You" was released as the album's lead single on October 28, 2002. It debuted at number 55 on the Billboard Hot 100Top Music Charts – Hot 100 – Billboard 200 – Music Genre Sales and went on to peak at number three. It was ranked eighth on the 2003 year-end Billboard Hot 100.Top Music Charts – Hot 100 – Billboard 200 – Music Genre Sales Internationally, the song peaked at number eight in Germany and within the top twenty in Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Its accompanying music video, directed by Darren Grant, featured appearances from various celebrities, including Missy Elliott, Lil' Kim, Tweet, Queen Latifah, Jaheim, Lyric, Lil' Jon, Eastside Boyz, Jamie Foxx, DMX, Quincy Jones, and Ananda Lewis. "Don't Know What to Tell Ya" was released as the second single on February 11, 2003. As its release in the United States was limited, it failed to enter both Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs. Internationally, it peaked at number 22 on the UK Singles Chart and number five on the UK R&B; Chart. "I Care 4 U", which was originally included on Aaliyah (2001), was released as the third single on April 8, 2003. The song had already peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs in 2002 as an "album cut" from Aaliyah despite not being released as a single. "Come Over" was released as the fourth and final single on May 27, 2003. It peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number nine on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs. ==Critical reception== I Care 4 U received mixed reviews from music critics. In a positive review for Entertainment Weekly, Craig Seymour said I Care 4 U showcased Aaliyah's "interpretive talent" and ability to inspire her songwriters, while Graham Smith from musicOMH deemed it "a fine introduction to a much missed artiste", particularly because of the six previously-unreleased songs. According to Vibe magazine's Jason King, the album compiled some of the most ambitious dance-pop of the previous ten years. Uncut said Aaliyah's "silvery and subtle reconfigurations of R&B;" were showcased on the compiled singles, which AllMusic's John Bush felt reminded listeners of her vocal talent. Bush was also impressed by the previously-unreleased tracks, writing that they "provide an intriguing look at where Aaliyah may have taken her career had she lived". Robert Christgau was somewhat less enthusiastic, viewing I Care 4 U as an incomplete compilation whose inconsistent mix of career highlights was nonetheless rectified by the quality of the new tracks, particularly "Erica Kane". In The Village Voice, he wrote: In a more critical review, Slant Magazines Sal Cinqeumani was not impressed by the new songs on what he said was "neither a posthumous album of all-new material nor a proper greatest hits package" but "a half-assed attempt at satiating the Aaliyah fan's need for both". Rolling Stone magazine's Arion Berger also felt the album's second half of newer songs was somewhat inferior to Timbaland's "impressive" productions on the first half, while Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times panned the previously-unreleased songs as "merely soothing sonic wallpaper, with Aaliyah's pretty yet personality-free voice often treated like just another element in the mix". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Keith Harris felt Aaliyah's catalogue warranted a more comprehensive compilation, although he believed the new songs proved she was maturing creatively before her death. Michael Paoletta from Billboard felt that in seven years, Aaliyah "had amassed an impressive track record" and that I Care 4 U showed Aaliyah's growth as an artist. He also mentioned that her "unrealized potential is particularly evident on recent tracks as "More Than a Woman" and the title track." ==Accolades== |- ! scope="row"| 2003 | Billboard R&B;/Hip-Hop Award | Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Single - Airplay | rowspan="2"| "Miss You" | | align="center"| |- ! scope="row"| 2003 | MTV Video Music Award | Best R&B; Video | | align="center"| |} ==Commercial performance== I Care 4 U debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of 279,500 copies sold, placing Aaliyah with her biggest first-week sales.

16594708	I Canadian Corps	thumb|right|The formation sign used to identify vehicles associated with corps-level units. I Canadian Corps was one of the two corps fielded by the Canadian Army during the Second World War. ==History== From December 24, 1940, until the formation of the First Canadian Army in April 1942, there was a single unnumbered Canadian Corps. I Canadian Corps became operational in Italy in November 1943 when the 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division joined the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, which had been assigned to the British Eighth Army immediately prior to the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943. I Canadian Corps was commanded successively by Lieutenant-General Harry Crerar (April 6, 1942, to March 19, 1944), Lieutenant-General Eedson Burns (March 20 to November 5, 1944), and Lieutenant-General Charles Foulkes (November 10, 1944, to July 17, 1945). However, the 1st Canadian Infantry Division took part in the Italian Campaign, participating in the Moro River Campaign and the Battle of Ortona in December 1943 as part of British V Corps and it was not until the fourth Battle of Monte Cassino (Operation Diadem) in May 1944 that I Canadian Corps fought its first battle as a corps. The Eighth Army held the corps in reserve until after the Gustav defences in the Liri valley had been broken and then brought it forward to assault successfully the next defensive line, the Hitler Line, shortly before the Allied capture of Rome in early June. Having taken part in the Allies' northward advance to Florence, the corps then took part in Operation Olive, the assault on the Gothic Line, in September 1944 before being transported during January–February 1945 in Operation Goldflake to rejoin the rest of the First Canadian Army in Belgium and the Netherlands. There the corps participated in the campaign to complete the liberation of the Netherlands. On May 6, 1945, at Wageningen, Lieutenant-General Foulkes received the final surrender by Colonel General Johannes Blaskowitz of all remaining German forces still active in the Netherlands. The corps was deactivated on July 17, 1945, as part of general demobilization. Although nominally a Canadian formation, I Canadian Corps contained significant elements at different times from other Allied countries. For example, in Italy, during the assault on the Gothic Line in the Fall of 1944, the corps included the British 4th Infantry Division, the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade. During the final campaign to liberate the Netherlands, the corps included for a time the British 49th Infantry Division. ==21st century== In 2015, personnel of the Canadian Army Doctrine and Training Centre, headquartered at CFB Kingston, began wearing the formation patch of I Canadian Corps on their ceremonial and service dress uniforms.As shown on the Combat Training Centre website at facebook.com on 27 July 2015 ==Major operations== *Operation Timberwolf, December 1943 *Operation Morning Glory, December 1943 *Operation Diadem, Liri Valley Offensive, May 1944 *Operation Olive, assault on the Gothic Line, September 1944 *Operation Goldflake, transport from Italy to the Netherlands, February–March 1945 *Operation Destroyer, advance from Nijmegen to Arnhem, April 1945 *Advance to Harderwijk on the coast of the IJsselmeer, April 1945 *Liberation of the Netherlands, March–May 1945 *Lieutenant-General Foulkes receives the surrender of all German forces in the Netherlands, May 5, 1945 *Security duties, delivery of relief supplies and infrastructure repair projects in the Netherlands, May–July, 1945 ==Order of Battle in Italy, 1944-45== *1st Canadian Infantry Division *5th Canadian Armoured Division *1st Canadian Armoured Brigade *Corps Troops **I Corps Defence Company, Lorne Scots **1st Armoured Car Regiment (Royal Canadian Dragoons) **7th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery (RCA) **1st Survey Regiment, RCA **9th Field Park Company, Royal Canadian Engineers (RCE) **12th Field Company, RCE **13th Field Company, RCE **14th Field Company, RCE **1st Drilling Company, RCE **I Canadian Corps Headquarters Signals, Royal Canadian Corps of Signals **No. 31 Corps Troops Company, Royal Canadian Army Service Corps (RCASC) **No. 32 Corps Troops Company, RCASC **I Canadian Corps Transport Company, RCASC **No. 1 Motor Ambulance Company, RCASC **No. 1 Headquarters Corps Car Company, RCASC **Nos. 4 & 5 Casualty Clearing Stations, Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps (RCAMC) **No. 8 Field Dressing Section, RCAMC **No. 5 Field Hygiene Section, RCAMC **Nos. 1, 3 & 8 Dental Companies, Canadian Dental Corps (CDC) **No. 11 Base Dental Company, CDC **No. 1 Corps and Army Troops Sub-Park, Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps (RCOC) **I Corps Troops Workshop, Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (RCEME) **No. 1 Recovery Company, RCEME **No. 3 Provost Company, Canadian Provost Corps (C Pro C) *Attached First Canadian Army Troops **No. 1 Army Group Royal Canadian Artillery ***11th Army Field Regiment, RCA ***1st Medium Regiment, RCA ***2nd Medium Regiment, RCA ***5th Medium Regiment, RCA **No. 41 Army Transport Company, RCASC **"H" Squadron, 25th Canadian Armoured Delivery Regiment (The Elgin Regiment), Canadian Armoured Corps **Nos. 1, 2 & 3 Field Transfusion Units, RCAMC **Nos. 3 & 16 Field Dressing Stations, RCAMC **Nos. 1, 3, 5, 14, 15 & 28 General Hospitals, RCAMC **No. 1 Convalescent Depot, RCAMC **Nos. 1, 2 & 3 Field Surgical Units, RCAMC ==Commanders== These officers commanded the I Canadian Corps:Col.

1662499	I Am the Movie	I Am the Movie is the debut studio album by American rock band Motion City Soundtrack, released on June 24, 2003, through Epitaph Records. The band had recorded several EPs prior to recording a full-length album, and their first attempts at doing so were unsuccessful. The album was originally recorded in 10 days at Black Lodge Studios in Eudora, Kansas, with producer Ed Rose in February 2002. The band found the sessions stressful considering the lack of time. Starting in mid-2002 at their concerts and online they distributed the album in the form of a CD which was hand-packaged inside of a floppy disk. The group attracted attention from several labels by the end of the year, and signed with independent label Epitaph in January 2003. They returned to Black Lodge for additional recording and remixing, with new bassist Matthew Taylor dubbing over the original bassist's parts, who had since left the band. Epitaph's version of the album—which included four new songs—was released on June 24, 2003, to critical acclaim. In the U.S., the album peaked at number 42 on Billboard Independent Albums chart. It was supported by the singles "My Favorite Accident" and "The Future Freaks Me Out". ==Background== Motion City Soundtrack was formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1997 by singer-songwriter Justin Pierre and guitarist Joshua Cain, who had previously played in a number of bands. The band went through several lineup changes. Through these, Cain and Pierre would often have to take over keyboard duties during shows. The group's first release was a 7-inch single, "Promenade / Carolina", released in 1999. Their next two releases, both extended plays—Kids for America and Back to the Beat—were released the following year. Over the course of the early 2000s, the band continued to tour and shuffle through members. In late 2001, while touring in Milton, Pennsylvania with the band Submerge, they convinced two of its members—bassist Matthew Taylor and drummer Tony Thaxton—to join Motion City. The band originally recorded an album prior to making I Am the Movie that they were unsatisfied with. The members of the band Ultimate Fakebook, with whom Motion City would often play shows, suggested they employ producer Ed Rose. They sent the original album to Rose in hopes of salvaging some material, but he advised them to just start over. Jesse Johnson, a friend and co-worker of Cain's, joined the band as keyboardist just three weeks before the band recorded the album. Johnson had never played the keyboard before but Cain taught him the parts that had already been written. ==Recording and production== I Am the Movie was recorded at Red House Studios (later known as Black Lodge Recording) in Eudora, Kansas in February 2002 with producer Ed Rose, who also engineered and mixed the recordings. During their time in Eudora, the band stayed at a $100 a night two-bedroom apartment owned by Red House. "There were a bunch of mattresses thrown on the floor and we were living up there in one room," guitarist Josh Cain remembered. The title of the album came from Cain's older brother, Brian. Pierre considered each song from the album like a scene from a film, and he considered the title a joke on him. Austin Lindstrom originally recorded bass guitar on the album. The bulk of the album was recorded over a ten-day period. Due to the short amount of time they had to record, several choruses on the album feature copy- and-pasted (or duplicated) vocal tracks. The sessions with Rose were difficult; he would insult the members if they made a mistake. "It was a combination because he had some weird sort of back surgery that week; we sucked as musicians and thought we could do the whole album in ten days," Pierre recalled. Though they budgeted for a $4,000 recording, the original version of I Am the Movie ended up costing $6,000 to make. == Release == I Am the Movie was first released in the summer of 2002, as a hand-packaged floppy disk; the band cut open floppy disks and packed a CD-R inside. These were available on the band's website and at their concerts. Pierre estimated that 3,000 copies of this edition were sold. By the end of 2002, the band began receiving offers from various record labels, including Universal, Triple Crown Records, and Drive-Thru Records, and they performed at industry showcases. Meanwhile, Brett Gurewitz, founder of Epitaph Records, learned of the band from members of the group Matchbook Romance. He attended four of their shows in Los Angeles that Pierre later regarded as among his worst, as his voice was poor from constant touring. While they were interested in Universal, they chose to sign to Epitaph as they felt the contract was less restrictive and more honest. Eli Janney from Girls Against Boys helped the band secure management and a lawyer. Motion City became part of a slew of Epitaph signings, including Matchbook Romance Scatter the Ashes and From First to Last, amid concerns the Southern California label had strayed too far from its roots, and seemed "a little too emo." With more time and money available, the band returned to Red House for additional recording over a period of 12 days. Taylor re-recorded the bass lines for the entire album, while Pierre recorded more vocals and Johnson added more keyboard parts. They also took more time to properly mix the album, as they were unsatisfied with the hurried original mix. Prior to signing with Epitaph, the band wrote and recorded three new songs—"Perfect Teeth", "Modern Chemistry", and "Autographs & Apologies". These were initially slated for a split EP with Reggie and the Full Effect and Ultimate Fakebook which never saw release. They also recorded a new version of "Capital H", as they did not like how the original sounded. Epitaph chose the aforementioned songs for inclusion on the re-released I Am the Movie, while also cutting "1000 Paper Cranes" from the track listing to repurpose as a B-side. Don C. Tyler mastered the recordings at Precision Mastering in Hollywood, California. Epitaph re-released I Am the Movie on June 24, 2003. "The Future Freaks Me Out" was released to radio on September 16, 2003. Three different versions of this album exist. The original, unsigned release had eleven tracks. The first two versions of the album were housed in 5¼" floppy discs and their respective paper sleeves. The second floppy disc release also contains a credit card with a track listing. Four new tracks (marked with a *) were added for the Epitaph release. These new tracks replaced "1000 Paper Cranes", which is not found in the regular version (but is included as a "bonus track" on the vinyl LP, briefly available from the band's website, and on the Japanese import). == Track listing == === Original release === #"Cambridge" – 2:30 #"Shiver" – 2:54 #"The Future Freaks Me Out" – 3:37 #"Indoor Living" – 3:45 #"My Favorite Accident" – 3:21 #"Boombox Generation" – 3:11 #"Don't Call It a Comeback" – 1:51 #"The Red Dress" – 2:37 #"Mary Without Sound" – 3:00 #"1000 Paper Cranes" – 2:29 #"A.O.K." – 3:39 === Epitaph release === #"Cambridge" – 2:30 #"Shiver" – 2:54 #"The Future Freaks Me Out" – 3:36 #"Indoor Living" – 3:47 #"My Favorite Accident" – 3:20 #"Perfect Teeth" – 3:29* #"Boombox Generation" – 3:07 #"Don't Call It a Comeback" – 1:51 #"Modern Chemistry" – 2:22* #"Capital H" – 2:52* #"Red Dress" – 2:36 #"Mary Without Sound" – 3:00 #"Autographs & Apologies" – 3:52* #"A-OK" – 3:47 #"1000 Paper Cranes" (Japanese bonus track) – 2:20 == Personnel == Personnel per 2003 edition booklet. ;Motion City Soundtrack * Joshua Cain – guitars, backing vocals * Tony Thaxton – drums, percussion * Justin Pierre – vocals, guitars, piano * Jesse Johnson – Moog, bells * Matthew Taylor – bass, backing vocals, piano ;Additional musicians * Austin Lindstrom – bass (original release) ;Production * Ed Rose – producer, engineer, mixing * Dave Pinksy – mastering (original release) * Doug Lefrak – management (original release) * Jason Rio – management (original release) * Josh Newman – management (original release) * Jason Dickman – CD design (original release) * Jesse Cain – photography (original release) * Richard Grabel – legal (original release) * Don C.

16675522	I Am What I Am (Ruth Copeland album)	I Am What I Am is the second album by English singer Ruth Copeland. The album was released by Invictus Records in 1971 and was produced and arranged by Ruth Copeland, though it is widely believed that the actual producer of the album was her then husband Jeffrey Bowen. As with her debut, Self Portrait, I Am What I Am contains contributions from George Clinton and the musicians from Parliament-Funkadelic, as well as local Detroit session players such as guitarist Ray Monette. In 1996, Ruth Copeland's first two albums were licensed by HDH Inc. and reissued by P-Vine Records individually. In 1997 these albums were reissued on one CD under the juxtaposed title Self Portrait/I Am What I Am (Deepbeats DEEPM 022). It was then issued under the title Gimme Shelter - The Invictus Sessions (Castle Music CMRCD 576). Both compilations omitted the track "Un Bel Di (One Fine Day)". The two (complete) albums, plus bonus single mixes of some of the songs, were released in a two-disc set by Edsel records in October 2009. ==Track listing== #"The Medal" (Ruth Copeland, Donald Charles Baldwin) #"Crying Has Made Me Stronger" (Ruth Copeland, George Clinton) #"Hare Krishna" (Ruth Copeland, George Clinton) (released as a single-Invictus Is 9088) #"Suburban Family Lament" (Ruth Copeland, Eddie Hazel) #"Play with Fire" (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards) #"Don't You Wish You Had (What You Had When You Had It?)"

17070479	I Come with the Rain	I Come with the Rain is a 2009 neo-noir thriller written and directed by Vietnamese-born French director Tran Anh Hung, starring American actor Josh Hartnett. After making three movies about Vietnam, Tran Anh Hung intended to make a baroque action film, a passionate thriller, both intense and poetic, haunted by three characters from the mythology of film and the Western world: the serial killer, the private investigator, and the Christ figure. The action takes place in Los Angeles, Mindanao and Hong Kong and brings together American and Asian actors.Director's notes , TF1 International The film score is written by the Argentine Academy Award Winner Gustavo Santaolalla and the English alternative rock band Radiohead. The filmmaker also makes heavy use of post-rock music, including songs by Explosions in the Sky, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and A Silver Mt. Zion. The film premiered in Tokyo at Toho Cinemas Roppongi Hills on May 27, 2009. ==Synopsis== Two years after killing Hasford, a serial killer, in the line of duty, Kline now works as a private detective, but he is still haunted by the ghosts of his past. A powerful pharmaceutical conglomerate boss hires Kline to find his only son Shitao who has mysteriously disappeared in the Philippines where he had been helping in an orphanage. Kline follows the trail left by the ethereal Shitao to the jungles of Mindanao, and then to the urban jungle of Hong Kong, where he enlists the help of Meng Zi, an old police officer friend. The search leads Kline to cross paths with local organized crime syndicate boss Su Dongpo, who is making trouble for the underworld, triggered by an overriding passion for his drug- addicted girlfriend Lili. Caught in the crossfire between the Hong Kong police and Su Dongpo's mafia drug ring which is also hunting for Shitao, Kline finds himself alone, in this unknown city, when Meng Zi is victim of an assassination attempt and is hospitalised. Leaving behind his 5-star hotel for a shabby murder scene apartment in order to get inside the mind of Shitao, Kline gradually loses himself in the terrifying memories of Hasford, whose speciality was dissecting his victims' limbs while they were still alive, then reassembling them into installation sculptures. After a few weeks immersed in his haunted memories, torn between good and evil, Kline is about to leave Hong Kong when he finds Shitao, who has become a mysterious vagrant with healing powers.Synopsis , Central Films ==Cast== ===Main cast=== *Josh Hartnett as Kline *Elias Koteas as Hasford *Lee Byung-hun as Su Dongpo *Takuya Kimura as Shitao *Shawn Yue as Meng Zi *Trần Nữ Yên Khê as Lili ===Supporting cast=== *Eusebio Poncela as Vargas *Sam Lee as The Monk Artist *Carl Ng as The Dead Sack Man *William Chow Tze Ho as Mi Fu *Bo-yuan Chan as Dai Xi *Russ Kingston as Felix Sportis *Jo Kuk as The 9mm Lover *David Tang as Wang Wei *Thea Aquino as The Erotic Dancer *Alvaro Longoria as The Psychiatrist *Benito Sagredo as The Male Nurse ==Festival screenings== ;6th Fresh Film Fest Section: Contemporary World Cinema Location: Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic Screening dates: August 13, 2009 - August 15, 2009 ;14th Busan International Film Festival Section: Gala Presentation Location: Busan, South Korea Screening dates: October 9, 2009 - October 13, 2009 - October 15, 2009 ;15th Lund International Fantastic Film FestivalInternational Competition 2009 , Fantastisk Film Festival Lund 23 September - 2 Oktober 2010 Section: International Competition (nominated: The Siren Best Film)What happens at Lund International Fantastic Film Festival 2010? , Fantastisk Film Festival Lund 23 September - 2 Oktober 2010 Location: Lund, Sweden Screening date: September 19, 2009 ;3rd Empire Open Cinema Section: Selection Location: Moscow, Russia Screening dates: September 2, 2010 ==References== ==External links== * archive * * *I Come with the Rain at Box Office Mojo *International Sales (TF1 International) Category:2009 films Category:2000s crime drama films Category:2009 independent films Category:2009 psychological thriller films Category:French neo-noir films Category:English-language French films Category:French independent films Category:Films set in Hong Kong Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in California Category:Films set in the Philippines Category:Films directed by Tran Anh Hung Category:Films shot in the Philippines Category:Films scored by Gustavo Santaolalla Category:2009 drama films Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s French films

17160115	I Believe in You (Paul Haig song)	"I Believe in You" is the first single from Paul Haig's proposed second album on Circa Records, Right on Line. Ultimately, the lack of success with this single and its follow-up, "Flight X", persuaded Circa to drop Haig and shelve the album. Right on Line contained tracks produced by James Locke (of The Chimes), Lil Louis and Mantronik. The album did eventually surface three years later on Les Disques Du Crepuscule, retitled as Coincidence vs Fate. LTM re- released a remastered version of the album in 2003 with extra tracks. == Track listing == # "I Believe in You" # "Flight X" # "I Believe in You" (Life in a Dolphinarium Mix) ==References== Category:1990 singles Category:Paul Haig songs Category:1989 songs Category:Songs written by Paul Haig
171628	I Am Sam	I Am Sam (stylized in all lowercase) is a 2001 American drama film co-written and directed by Jessie Nelson, and starring Sean Penn as a father with an intellectual disability, Dakota Fanning as his bright and inquisitive daughter, and Michelle Pfeiffer as his lawyer. Dianne Wiest, Loretta Devine, Richard Schiff, and Laura Dern appear in supporting roles. Nelson and co- writer Kristine Johnson researched the issues facing adults with intellectual disabilities by visiting the non-profit organization L.A. GOAL (Greater Opportunities for the Advanced Living). They subsequently cast two actors with disabilities, Brad Silverman and Joe Rosenberg, in key roles. The film's title is derived from the lines "I am Sam / Sam I am" of the book Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss, which is included in the movie. The film received polarized reviews from critics and audiences. It grossed over $97 million at the box office, against a production budget of $22 million. For his role as Sam, Penn was highly acclaimed and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. The film launched the career of child actress Dakota Fanning, who was then seven years old and had only acted in two small roles. She became the youngest actress to be nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award. ==Plot== In 1993, Samuel Dawson, a Starbucks barista with an intellectual disability, becomes the single father of Lucy Diamond Dawson, named after The Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", following their abandonment by her mother, a homeless woman with whom Sam had a sexual encounter. Sam is well-adjusted and has a supportive group of friends with disabilities, as well as a kind, agoraphobic neighbor, Annie, who takes care of Lucy when Sam cannot. Nearly seven years later in 2001, Sam provides a loving place for precocious Lucy, though she soon surpasses his mental capacity and ability. Other children bully her for having an intellectually disabled father, and she becomes too embarrassed to accept that she is more advanced than he is. In danger of losing child custody, Sam gets advice from his friends and also hires a lawyer, Rita Harrison, whose absorption in her work and neglect of her son reveals her to also struggle with her role as a parent. In an attempt to prove that she is not cold, Rita agrees to take on Sam's case pro bono. As they work to secure Sam's rights, Sam helps Rita see her own life anew. This includes encouraging her to leave her philandering husband and repair her fractious relationship with her son. At the trial, due to pressure from the prosecutor, Sam breaks down after becoming convinced he is not capable of raising Lucy. Afterward, she resides in a foster home with Miranda “Randy” Carpenter, but tries to convince Sam to help her run away. Sam moves so he is near Lucy, so she continually leaves in the middle of the night to go to his apartment, though he immediately returns her. The foster parents, though, decide not to adopt her as they had planned, and return her to Sam. Randy assures him that she will tell the judge he is the best parent for Lucy. In turn, Sam asks Randy if she will help him raise Lucy because he feels she needs a mother figure. The final scene depicts a soccer game, in which Sam referees and Lucy participates as a player. In attendance are Lucy's former foster family, Sam's friend group, and a newly single Rita with her son. ==Cast== ==Soundtrack== The Grammy Award–nominated soundtrack, in addition to a John Powell score, also has cover versions of songs by the Beatles. The album contents are made up entirely of cover versions of songs by The Beatles, although it was originally intended to consist of the group's original recordings. When producers were unable to obtain the rights to the original tracks, they commissioned artists such as the Black Crowes, Nick Cave, Stereophonics, Eddie Vedder, Sheryl Crow, Sarah McLachlan, Rufus Wainwright, the Wallflowers, Ben Harper, the Vines, and Ben Folds to record the versions released. Penn's brother, Michael Penn, is also featured on a duet with his wife Aimee Mann. As the movie had been shot and produced to the original Beatles music, the artists had to record their covers to the same musical timing (tempo) as that of the Beatles' original pieces. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 35% based on reviews from 145 critics, with an average rating of 4.77/10. The site's consensus reads: "Not only does the manipulative I Am Sam oversimplify a complex issue, it drowns it in treacle." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 28 of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade "A" on scale of A to F. A. O. Scott of the New York Times wrote that "I Am Sam is not a bad movie, and its intentions are unimpeachable. But its sentimentality is so relentless and its narrative so predictable that the life is very nearly squeezed out of it." Variety wrote: "Undone by its best intentions, I Am Sam is an especially insipid example of the Hollywood message movie". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that "every device of the movie's art is designed to convince us Lucy must stay with Sam, but common sense makes it impossible to go the distance with the premise." Ebert also criticized the morality tale character of the movie, saying that "you can't have heroes and villains when the wrong side is making the best sense." Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times reviewed it positively as a "most inviting and accessible film that turns upon a mental condition that most people would prefer not to think about." Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle commended Sean Penn for his performance: "Penn's accuracy, his lack of condescension or sentiment, and his willingness to inhabit his character without any implicit commentary take what might have been the equivalent of an inflated TV movie and elevate it to the level of art." David Denby of The New Yorker, found Michelle Pfeiffer to be the standout: "Pfeiffer, enormously likable in the role, almost saves the movie." ===Accolades=== Sean Penn was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor and the Satellite Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. Dakota Fanning won the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Young Performer, the Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award for Youth in Film, the Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Youth Actress, the Satellite Special Achievement Award for Outstanding New Talent, and the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film – Young Actress Age Ten or Under. She was also nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role. The soundtrack was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. The film won the inaugural Stanley Kramer Award from the Producers Guild of America, and was nominated for the Humanitas Prize and the Japan Academy Prize for Outstanding Foreign Language Film.

17190651	I Am... I Said	"I Am... I Said" is a song written and recorded by Neil Diamond. Released as a single on March 15, 1971, it was quite successful, at first slowly climbing the charts, then more quickly rising to number 4 on the U.S. pop singles chart by May 1971. It fared similarly across the Atlantic, reaching number 4 on the UK pop singles chart as well. ==Inspiration== "I Am... I Said", which took Diamond four months to compose, is one of his most intensely personal efforts, making reference to both Los Angeles and New York City.Abramovitch, Seth (May 24, 2015) "Neil Diamond Marks L.A. Homecoming with Sold-Out Run at Hollywood Bowl", Hollywood Reporter. Retrieved September 1, 2021. Diamond told Mojo magazine in July 2008 that the song came from a time he spent in therapy in Los Angeles. He said: In the same month, he told Q that the song was written "to find [him]self" and added, "It's a tough thing for me to gather myself after singing that song." But Diamond has also given another inspiration for this song: an unsuccessful tryout for a movie about the life and death of the comedian Lenny Bruce. Author David Wild interviewed Diamond for a 2008 book and he discussed how his efforts to channel Lenny Bruce evoked such intense emotions that it led him to spend some time in therapy.David Wild. He Is . . . I Say: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Neil Diamond. Da Capo Press, 2008, pp. 107-108. ==Reception== Critical opinion on "I Am... I Said" has generally been positive, with Rolling Stone calling its lyric excellent in a 1972 review, while The New Yorker used it to exemplify Diamond's songwriting opaqueness in a 2006 retrospective. Cash Box described the song as having "excellent production and performance." Record World said "Personal number does Descartes' 'I think therefore I am' one better and Neil's philosophy always makes the charts" A 2008 Diamond profile in The Daily Telegraph simply referred to the song's "raging existential angst," and Allmusic calls it "an impassioned statement of emotional turmoil... very much in tune with the confessional singer/songwriter movement of the time." The song was not without its detractors, however. Humorist Dave Barry said: The song garnered Diamond his first Grammy Awards nomination, for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1971) Peak position Australia (Kent Music Report) 10 Belgium 8 Canada RPM Top Singles 2 Germany 3 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 6 New Zealand (Listener)[ Flavour of New Zealand, ] 1 South Africa (Springbok) 9 Switzerland 2 UK 4 U.S. Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–1990 - 4 U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary 2 U.S. Cash Box Top 100Cash Box Top 100 Singles, May 1, 1971 4 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1971) Rank Canada 29 Netherlands Dutch Charts Annual Reviews - Single 1971 54 U.S. Billboard Hot 100Musicoutfitters.com 91 U.S. Cash Box 84 ==Certifications== ==Other versions== "I Am...

The single version leads off the LP, while a reprise of the song, taken from midway to a variant ending with Diamond exclaiming "I am!", concludes. It has also been included in live versions on Diamond's Hot August Night (from 1972, in a performance that Rolling Stone would later label "fantastically overwrought"). Checkmates, Ltd. released a version of the song on their 1971 album, Life. Brooke White performed the song on American Idol's seventh season during its Neil Diamond week, changing the lyric to replace New York City with her home state of Arizona. Among the foreign versions are the Italian language "La casa degli angeli" ("House of the angels"), performed by Caterina Caselli in 1971's album "Una grande emozione" ("A great emotion"), and by Dutchman Jan Rot on his 2008 album Hallelujah as "Zeg God... zeg ik", taking the title as someone who curses, while the Jewish word for God means 'I am'. The Brazilian singer Diana recorded the song as "Porque Brigamos" ("Why we argue") in 1972, with lyrics written by the composer and producer Rossini Pinto. The band Killdozer also covered the song on their 1987 album Little Baby Buntin'. Jamaican reggae singer Mikey Spice released the album I Am I Said in 2014, including a cover of this song. Country artist Billy Ray Cyrus released a version of the song on his 2020 EP "Singin Hills Sessions Volume 1". ==See also== * Dave Barry's Book of Bad Songs * List of songs about Los Angeles * List of songs about New York City * Clint Eastwood at the 2012 Republican National Convention ==References== Category:1971 songs Category:1971 singles Category:Checkmates, Ltd. songs Category:Irish Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Neil Diamond songs Category:Number-one singles in New Zealand Category:Songs about Los Angeles Category:Songs about New York City Category:Songs written by Neil Diamond Category:Uni Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Tom Catalano

17465955	I Am a Tree	"I Am a Tree" is the second episode in the third season of the American serial drama television series Grey's Anatomy, and the 38th episode of the overall series. The episode focuses mainly on Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), as her romantic relationship with Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) is tested through the arrival of his parents. The episode is the first to feature Diahann Carroll, who begins a recurring role as Jane Burke, Preston's mother. The installment marked Eric Dane's second appearance in the series and first appearance in the season, despite not being credited. The episode was instrumental in the producers' decision to have Dane promoted to series regular status in the following episode. Further story arcs which provided a particular focus on individual characters include Addison Montgomery-Shepherd (Kate Walsh) facing Derek Shepherd's (Patrick Dempsey) desire to divorce her, Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) coping with Denny Duquette's (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) death and the repercussions of her choice to quit the internship program, and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) struggling with the choice between Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell). Also dealt with was Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) attempting to have Stevens rejoin the program, Mark Sloan (Dane) arriving from New York City in order to resume his romantic relationship with Montgomery, and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) being evacuated from the hospital. The script for the episode was written by executive producer Krista Vernoff, while Jeff Melman served as the director. The installment aired on September 28, 2006, in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), with approximately 20.93 million viewers tuning in. Ranking second in the time-slot and third for the week, the episode garnered an 8.6 Nielsen rating in the 18–49 demographic, seeing a decrease from the previous episode, which received a 9.0 rating. Critical response of the episode ranged from mixed-to-negative; however, Montgomery's storyline was a particular source of critical acclaim from television reviewers. Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, filming occurred in Los Angeles, California. == Plot == "I Am a Tree" opens to a voice-over narration from Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) about impulses, the episode's main theme. Having undergone surgery following the shooting in the season two finale, Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) received an unanticipated visit from his parents, Jane Burke (Diahann Carroll) and Donald Burke (Richard Roundtree). It is revealed that the main reason for their unannounced arrival is meeting Preston's love interest, Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh). Due to the Burkes' overprotective attitude and strict moral beliefs, Yang initially fails to impress them, determining a negative outlook on their romantic relationship. Following the exposure of his affair with his former love interest Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) begins considering and ultimately decides on divorcing his wife. Facing the devastating news, Addison Montgomery Shepherd (Kate Walsh) abandons her hospital duties for the day, turning to alcoholism as a means to deal with the depression. Feeling guilty for being the reason her marriage had initially failed, Montgomery begins questioning her ability to interact with men. Having made up his mind on divorcing Montgomery, Shepherd attempts at becoming romantically involved with Grey once again. Aware of Shepherd's plans, Grey begins to question her feelings for Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell), with whom she had previously began a relationship. Unable to decide between what she wants and what she needs, Grey unwillingly stirs a rivalry between the two men. Now being unemployed, Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) tries to move on after the death of her fiancé, Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Realizing that she is unable to do so, she starts using baking as the way to overcome the grief. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) realizes her decisive role in Duquette's death, and begins experiencing strong guilt. Influenced by the recent revelations, Bailey tries to convince Stevens to reenter the internship program, which she had left as a result of her actions leading up to Duquette's death. Ultimately, Stevens chooses to attempt at returning to work at the hospital. Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.) learns that Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) is living in the hospital basement, leading to her relocating with George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) in Grey's house, much to the displeasure of his roommates. A teenager patient with a large branch protruding through his abdomen is admitted into the hospital, and is revealed to have been thrown into a pile of tree clippings while street luging unprotected. The boy's distressed father Jeffrey Hernandez (Javier Grajeda) uses violence in order to make his son realize the danger he has gotten himself into. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) is assigned to the patient and unwillingly becomes emotionally involved in the case, banning further interaction between the two. Shepherd, Bailey and Yang treat a patient admitted in the neurosugical service, who has a tumor pressing against his frontal lobe. His condition forces him to verbally express each thought passing his mind, without being able to control it in any way. Realizing her inability to choose between the two men in her romantic background, Grey decides on dating both, therefore attempting to compare their dedication towards her. At the conclusion of the episode, Shepherd visits Montgomery in her hotel room, in order to share his final thoughts on their upcoming divorce, but is shocked at the revelation that she had sex with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). == Production == "I Am a Tree" was written by Primetime Emmy Award nominee and series executive producer, Krista Vernoff. Filmmaker and television producer Jeff Melman served as the director, his first such credit since "Blues for Sister Someone" in the second season. The soundtrack used in the episode included Moloko's "The Time Is Now", The Chalets' "Theme From Chalets", Bitter:Sweet's "The Mating Game", Mat Kearney's "Crashing Down" and Roland Clark's "Open Your Eyes". Also featured in the episode was "Open Your Eyes", the fifth single from the Northern Irish alternative rock band Snow Patrol's album Eyes Open. Similarly to "Chasing Cars", the band's previous single featured in the series, the song gained significant popularity after being used in the series, resulting in a drastic rise in the sales number on iTunes. Several one-time guest actors appeared in the episode, including Richard Roundtree, who portrayed Donald Burke, and Javier Grajeda, acting as Jeffrey Hernandez. Although fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, filming primarily occurred in Los Angeles, California. Scenes in the operating room were filmed at the Prospect Studios in Los Feliz, Los Angeles. Following his appearance in the second season, Dane returned to the series in this episode. According to Dane, he was originally hired by the series producers in order to film one episode, but was ultimately asked to return. "As far as I know, I was doing one episode. That's what I signed up for. But because of who the character was, there was a lot of room for him to come back. I got real lucky, they invited me back." When offered the series regular position, Dane was not aware of the character's future on the show, noting the boldness of the character's introduction in the previous season, by contrast to his first appearance in the third season. Fellow cast member Pompeo offered her insight on Sloan's reintroduction, noting that the inevitability of the character's return was due to his overwhelming popularity, mainly among the female audience, who immediately responded to the concept of the character. Dane only makes a short, uncredited appearance in the episode, seeing his naked character exiting a steamy bathroom. The scene has become one of the most iconic of the series. Dane offered his outlook on the scene, "It was a spectacular entrance. It was all about this brand new towel, which had a hard time staying together. Every time I put it together and let my hands go, it was almost like throwing caution to the wind." == Reception == The episode received mixed-to-negative reviews among television critics, and underperformed the previous episode in terms of viewership. "I Am a Tree" was originally broadcast on September 28, 2006 in the United States, on the American Broadcasting Company. The episode was viewed by a total of 23.48 million Americans, down 1.93% from the previous episode "Time Has Come Today", which garnered 25.41 million viewers. In terms of viewership, "I Am a Tree" ranked second for the night, just behind CBS's juggernaut CSI. The episode did not win in viewership, as its 8.2 Nielsen rating ranked second in its 9:00 Eastern time-slot and the entire night, for the rating of the key 18–49 demographic. == References == ==External links== * Category:2006 American television episodes Category:Grey's Anatomy (season 3) episodes Category:Television episodes directed by Jeff Melman
1754908	I Am... (Ayumi Hamasaki album)	I Am... (stylized in sentence case) is the fourth studio album by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki. It was released on New Years Day (January 1), 2002 via Avex Trax and their Taiwan-based headquarters. It was distributed in two physical formats—a standard CD and Playbutton—and for digital consumption. After the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, United States, Hamasaki, who started working on her new project, changed the original music and design direction by emphasizing lighter themes than her previous work. As a result, the record delves with hope, peace and love, superimposed on J-Pop- inspired rock music. Upon its release, I Am... received favorable reviews from music critics. Many publications commended Hamasaki's musical direction and the commercial appeal, while some reviewers noted that some tracks were fillers. Commercially, it experienced huge success in Japan, reaching atop of the Oricon Albums Chart. It was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of three million units, the album then won the Album of the Year in Asia Association Music Prize Awards. In order to promote the album, nearly half of the songs from the record were released as singles; additionally, "M" and "Evolution" sold over one million copies in Japan. After its release, she commenced two concert tours within Japan; a tour and a tour, both of which experienced commercial success and spawned live DVD releases. Before I Am..., Hamasaki felt that she would not enter an Asian market; thus, she never performed outside Japan and did not use English in her lyrics. However, shortly after the release of the album, she performed at the 2002 MTV Asia Music Awards ceremony, her first performance held outside Japan. ==Background and development== On September 28, 2000, Hamasaki released her third studio album Duty to critical and commercial success; moreover, it remains her best-selling studio album. Additionally, she started recording her fourth studio album after its release, spawning the single "M" in December that year. However, Hamasaki's label Avex Trax planned an idea to published a musical retrospect, but the singer refused. Avex Trax ignored her refusal and went ahead with the plan, releasing A Best in March 2001 as a "competitive strategy" against Japanese recording artist Hikaru Utada and their album, Distance; this resulted into a minor halt towards her new material. Subsequently, she returned to various studios in Japan to record new work. However, Hamasaki became emotionally struck by the effects of the September 11 attacks, and had second guesses about certain material on the album. As a result, she decided to scrap the original musical direction a focus on "lighter themes" such as faith and peace. Along with this decision, Hamasaki decided to expand her market by performing outside of Japan; in 2002, she attended and performed at the MTV Video Music Awards in Singapore, her first to do so. During the production and composing phase of the album, Hamasaki became dissatisfied of the results her team had given her for the track "M", so she decided to compose the tune herself.Shikano Atsushi. Rockin'on Japan. February 2001. Volume 165. Feeling happier about the change, she focused on composing and producing more material under the alias CREA. ==Composition== Musically, I Am... is a rock album that incorporates elements of J-Pop, electronic music and acoustic-driven instrumentation. The record holds 15 tracks, alongside a hidden recording at the end titled "Flower Garden"; this was Hamasaki's second time she performed this strategy, after Loveppears (1999). Additionally, the singer provided 10 compositions to the album, the most participation in any of her records. I Am... sees the return of her previous composers and arrangers: Tasuku, CMJK, Hal, Dai Nagao (under the alias D.A.I.) and Naoto Suzuki, while the album is solely produced by Max Matsuura. Despite 16 tracks, it consists of two interlude tracks; "Opening Run" and "Taskinlude", and a varied version of "Endless Sorrow", titled the "Gone With the Wind version". Japanese musician Tetsuya Komuro is credited as an additional composer to the record for his and Hamasaki's single "A Song is Born", which originally featured vocals by Komuro's wife Keiko Yamada. Many of the songs on the album shift keys; most shift to a relative key. "M" and "Still Alone" shift to the parallel key; "Evolution" and "Naturally" shift to the dominant and subdominant keys, respectively.Ayumi Hamasaki - Piano Solo - New Piano Sounds Top 25. Volume 7. The lyrical content on I Am..., as aforementioned, deals with lighter themes such as hope and peace, alongside additional depictions of love and Hamasaki's personal experiences. ==Release== I Am... was released on New Years Day (January 1), 2002 via Avex Trax and their Taiwan-based headquarters. It was distributed in two physical formats—a standard CD and Playbutton—and for digital consumption. According to Hamasaki, the original promotional photography had been photographed by Toru Kumazawa, noted to be a lot "darker" than her previous work with him. However, after the singer's change of theme and direction due to the September 11 attacks, she organised another shoot with Kumazawa. The second round of photography depicted Hamasaki in an outfit covered in leaves and vines. She placed a dove on her shoulder for the shot, as a symbolic message of peace and hope. The CD version included a 24-page booklet that featured shots of Hamasaki in a desert, while an additional lyrical booklet came with it. Regarding the change, where she labelled it a "peace muse", she explained; > I had a completely different idea for the cover at first. We'd already > reserved the space, decided the hair and makeup and everything. But after > the incident, as is typical of me, I suddenly changed my mind. I knew it > wasn't the time for gaudiness, for elaborate sets and costumes. It sounds > odd coming from me, but I realize what I say and how I look has a great > impact. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ;Oricon Chart (Japan) Release Chart Peak position First Week Sales Sales total Chart run January 1, 2002 Oricon Daily Album Chart 1 Oricon Weekly Album Chart 1 1,751,360 2,495,000 25 Oricon Monthly Album Chart 1 Oricon Yearly Album Chart 2 ===Singles=== Date Title Peak position Weeks Sales December 13, 2000 "M" 1 18 weeks 1,600,000 January 31, 2001 "Evolution" 1 17 weeks 1,145,000 March 7, 2001 "Never Ever" 1 12 weeks 850,000 May 16, 2001 "Endless Sorrow" 1 11 weeks 860,000 July 11, 2001 "Unite!" 1 17 weeks 663,000 September 27, 2001 "Dearest" 1 16 weeks 825,000 December 12, 2001 "A Song Is Born" 1 10 weeks 510,000 March 6, 2002 "Daybreak (re-cut single)" 2 9 weeks 260,000 == Certifications == ==Release history== Region Date Format Catalogue number Japan January 1, 2002 HDCD AVCD-17037 Taiwan January 1, 2002 CD AVJCD-10100 Hong Kong January 4, 2002 CD AVTCD-95550 China 2002 CD AVTCD-95550/B *SCD-782 South Korea 2002 CD (CCCD) SMJTCD018 *SMJTCD018 ==Notes== ==References== Category:2002 albums Category:Ayumi Hamasaki albums Category:Avex Group albums Category:Japanese-language albums
17569693	I Can't Break It to My Heart	"I Can't Break It to My Heart" is the fourth single from Delta Goodrem's third studio album Delta. It was released to radio on 12 July 2008. Goodrem confirmed the single in an article in the Australian issue of Cosmopolitan. ==Critical reception== Bill Brothetorn from Boston Herald said that: "Her strong, soaring soprano impresses throughout, especially on piano ballads 'I Can't Break It to My Heart'." ==Music video== Goodrem claimed on radio that the music video would be of Behind The Scenes footage most likely from the intimate concert, 'A Night With Delta Goodrem'. The music video debuted on Sunrise on 17 July 2008 and features various behind the scenes clips of Goodrem from the past few months, including photo shoots for the Australian release of Delta, travelling around Japan and the US, and many candid moments which, as her official site explains, "captures Delta out of the limelight as her natural, gorgeous self". These are all intertwined with a performance of "I Can't Break It to My Heart" from her special A Night with Delta Goodrem. ==Performance and production== Both the CD single and the iTunes EP went on sale on Saturday 16 August. The single received heavy promotion (a marked change from the previous single) in the form of three instore performances and signings, and appearances on morning programme Sunrise and interview programme Rove Live. The instore promotion appeared in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. In an out-of-the-ordinary move, the CD single was made available for only $1.99, and the iTunes EP (containing four songs) was sold for $1.69. ==Track listing== CD single #"I Can't Break It to My Heart" – 4:00 #"In This Life" (Diamond Cut Mix) – 4:53 #"Burn for You" (Live at The Chapel) – 3:33 iTunes Australia EP #"I Can't Break It to My Heart" – 4:00 #"In This Life" (Diamond Cut Mix) – 4:53 #"Burn for You" (Live at The Chapel) – 3:33 #"Edge of Seventeen" (Live Medley) [Seymour Centre] – 3:55 ==Katherine Jenkins version== Opera singer Katherine Jenkins performed a version of the song on her album Daydream. She also released the song as a single. ==Chart performance== Although reaching number one on the ARIA Physical Singles Chart, on 24 August, the single only debuted at No. 13 on the Australian Singles Chart. The following week the song dropped out of the top 40 to No. 42, making it Goodrem's second least successful single, after her debut single "I Don't Care" which peaked at No. 64 in 2001. The 29 spot drop was the fifth biggest drop within the top 50 of this decade, after Psycho Teddy's "Psycho Teddy" (No. 5 to No. 70) and Francesca's "Way of the world" (Number 3 to out of chart), Paul "The Chief" Harragon's "That's Gold" (No. 8 - No. 47) and Joel Turner's "Funk U Up" (No. 13 - No. 44).

1767607	I (Meshuggah EP)	I is the fifth EP by Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah. It was released on 13 July 2004 via Fractured Transmitter Recording Company. A remastered reissue was released on 30 September 2014. The "Special Edition" adds "Bleed" and "Dancers to a Discordant System" live from The Ophidian Trek and Pitch Black. ==Background== Meshuggah drummer Tomas Haake said of the EP, "That whole track was written and recorded just on random. Me and Fredrik would just jam on something, and when we found something that was kind of cool, he would walk into the control room. I would just record drums and it wasn't a set pattern, I would just kind of stray away from the pattern, but just keep going in that vibe. Then we had to chart everything and go bar by bar to record the guitars afterwards, because it's all just random." Thordendal would later post the chart of the first part of the song on his Instagram account. Haake later commented that the song was "originally recorded for Jason Popson's Fractured Transmitter record label" and that it was a "'one-off' that Nuclear Blast gave us the go-ahead for — as we were under contract with them." ==Track listing== The original vinyl release has track 1 on side A, and tracks 2-4 on side B while the 2016 re-issue only has track 1 ==Personnel== * Tomas Haake – drums * Mårten Hagström – rhythm guitar *Jens Kidman – vocals * Fredrik Thordendal – lead guitar, bass ==References== Category:Meshuggah albums Category:2004 EPs

17873255	I Am (Monrose album)	I Am is the third studio album by German pop trio Monrose. It was first released by Starwatch Music, Cheyenne Records and Warner Music on 26 September 2008 in German-speaking Europe. The band reunited with frequent contributors Jiant and Snowflakers and Danish producer Jonas Jeberg to work on the bulk of the album, though several new collaborators were consulted to hand in music, including Ronny Svendsen and Nermin Harambasic from Norwegian music collective Dsign Music, Oscar Gorres, Didrik Thott, Carl Björsell, JoelJoel, Guy Chambers, and OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder. Taking Monrose's work further into dance and electro music, the album scored a generally negative reception from music critics, with laut.de calling them "the Sugababes for discount store-fans." Upon its release, I Am debuted at number nine on the German Albums Chart and reached top twenty in Austria and Switzerland. It spawned three singles, including Tedder-penned up tempo song "Strike the Match", which became a top ten hit in Germany, as well as "Hit'n'Run" and "Why Not Us", both of which missed the top ten. ==Production and songs== The songs on I Am were selected out of more than six hundred demo tracks. The album's opening track, "Strike the Match", was penned by OneRepublic singer Ryan Tedder and Deborah Epstein. Selected out of several tracks in Tedder's repertoire, it was the first song confirmed to be appearing on the album. Released as its leading single, the song reached the top ten of the German Singles Chart. Second track "A Love Bizarre" is a cover version of the 1985 single by Sheila E. and Prince. Using the original instrumental as produced by Prince, the song has been described as all-time favorite by band member Guemmour. "Certified" was written by longtime contributors Edwin "Lil' Eddie" Serrano and Jonas Jeberg, and has been described as "high-pitched, technical, and scratching." "Why Not Us" by Guy Chambers has been categorized as an "emotional mid-tempo ballad [...] for the wintertime." Originally planned to be released as the album's second single, it was released as the third. In addition, the song served as a promotional track for the We Love Otto mail order campaign. "Stolen" features background vocals by Jamie Pineda from the successful pop music project Sweetbox after Jamie had recorded the song first. Fifth track "Going Out Tonight" incorporates elements of ragga and dancehall music, including rapped verses by all three band members, while "You Can Look" combines dance-pop with rock music. "Teach Me How to Jump" deals with death. The song was recorded in dedication to lost ones, including Guemmour's father, who died in 1992. ==Critical reception== I Am received mainly negative reviews. LetMeEntertainYou entitled the album's tracks as "sorted out material from the collection of immoral books of Timbaland," calling it also "fiddling" and "sparsely innovative." Further criticisms stated that the girls' voices had been edited into digital cawings which get dislodged from the professional but overproduced music. Although CDStarts dismissed Monrose's original R'n'B/Pop- style, it deplored their attempt to go more into electropop as doing them no favors, and suggested that it could lead to a downfall from their established position in the German music scene. ==Chart performance== I Am debuted and peaked at number 9 on the German Albums Chart on 10 October 2008. It marked the band's third consecutive top ten entry and remained 14 weeks on the chart. In Switzerland, I Am debuted at number 14 on the Swiss Hitparade. It spent another four weeks on the chart. In Austria, the album became the band's first album to miss the top 20 of the Ö3 Austria Albums Chart. It peaked at number 20. ==Track listing== Notes * denotes additional producer * denotes co- producer Sample credits *"A Love Bizarre" is a cover version of the same- titled 1985 song performed by American singer Sheila E. ==Charts== Weekly chart performance Chart (2008) Peak position European Top 100 Albums (Billboard)[ US Billboard European Top 100 Albums] 35 == Release history == I Am release history Region Date Edition Format Label Austria 26 September 2008 Germany Switzerland ==References== ==External links== * Monrose.de — official site Category:2008 albums Category:Monrose albums Category:Warner Music Group albums Category:Albums produced by Cutfather Category:Albums produced by Ryan Tedder
18050728	I Believe (Blessid Union of Souls song)	"I Believe" is a single by the American alternative rock band Blessid Union of Souls from their 1995 debut album, Home. Vocalist Eliot Sloan wrote the song after the father of his girlfriend "Lisa" forced her to stop dating Sloan because of his race. "I Believe" is the band's highest-charting single in the United States, reaching number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, and it became a top-20 hit in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. ==History== According to the "I Believe Story" from Blessid Union of Souls's compilation album Almost Acoustic (Volume 1), the song was written by vocalist Eliot Sloan in the early morning when he imagined the main piano sample which would be used in the song and then played it. Eliot Sloan stated in an interview with The Celebrity Cafe that he wrote the song about his relationship with "Lisa", a girl he once dated. Lisa's father allegedly threatened to cut off her college tuition if she continued to see Eliot. They said good-bye and went their separate ways. He said that he still very much missed her, and placed a message in the liner notes of Home: "Lisa, give me a call sometime just to say hello, my number is still the same."Home liner notes In the 2001 compilation album, Blessid Union of Souls: The Singles, the song was re-recorded in a punk-reggae style. ==Lyrics== In an interview with thecelebritycafe.com, Eliot Sloan said "when I sing 'Love will find a way,' I mean 'God will find a way,'" and that he has always believed that "God is love". While the song uses fairly subtle Christian themes, as do many of the band's songs, they tried to make it not sound too preachy. On the edited version for radio, the word "nigger" in the third verse is replaced with "brother". ==Critical reception== In a review of Home by AllMusic, staff writer Tom Demalon said that the song "revealed the band to have more of a social conscience than similar acts such as Hootie & the Blowfish through the spiritually tinged lyrics." In a review by Rolling Stone, staff writer Paul Evans called the song "all righteous, wide-eyed affirmation". ==Music video== The music video, directed by Michael Salomon, shows the band members singing the song, interspersed with footage representing the ideas of the song. ==Track listings== * UK CD single # "I Believe" (radio mix) – 3:45 # "Heaven" – 4:33 # "I Believe" (original version) – 3:45 # "I Believe" (Blessid Q mix) – 4:02 * US cassette single :A1.

1845461	I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!	I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! is a brand of a spreadable emulsion of vegetable oil in water with butter flavorCalvani Terry. Antitrust Law Journal, 1989, "Advertising Regulation: The States v. FTC. "...a nationally distributed butter substitute, 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.'")Cerklewski, F.L. Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, 2005, "Calcium fortification of food can add unneeded dietary phosphorus". "...and butter substitute (I Can't Believe It's Not Butter..." produced by Upfield and marketed as a substitute for butter. ==History== The J.H. Filbert company, based in Baltimore, Maryland, developed the product in 1979 as a low-cost alternative to butter for the food service industry. The name originated from a comment by the husband of a company secretary as he sampled the product and it was first marketed to retail consumers in 1981. The company was acquired by Unilever in 1986, which then expanded sales of the product, previously only available primarily in the Washington, DC/Baltimore area, throughout the entire United States in 1988 and later to the United Kingdom, Canada and Mexico in 1991.Wyman, Carolyn (2004). Better Than Homemade: Amazing Foods That Changed The Way We Eat. Quirk Books. pp.50-52. Jones, Geoffrey (2005). Renewing Unilever: Transformation and Tradition. Oxford University Press. pp. 102-03. The product was put on the market in Germany in 2011 and in Chile in 2012. Fabio has been the brand's celebrity spokesman since 1994, appearing in many of the brand's commercials, usually with his only line of dialogue being the brand name. ==Varieties== In addition to a regular and 'light' spread, Unilever also uses the brand name to market a liquid butter substitute contained in a spray-bottle. This product is an emulsion of vegetable oil in water formulated with a 'hint' of butter flavor (derived from buttermilk) and is marketed as having zero calories and zero fat content. In 2017, Unilever announced two new varieties, "It's Vegan" and "It's Organic". ==Consumer sales== ===United States=== It was reported in July 2005 (per research from the market research company Information Resources) that the product at that time led in product sales for its category of margarines, butter blends and spreads, with sales revenue standing at US$244.7 million, summarized from 52 weeks up to July 10, 2005. But by 2012, the situation had changed. It was reported in 2012 by Euromonitor International that while sales of butter and spreadable oil fell, margarine sales increased by 1.1 percent, but sales of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter fell by 3.9 percent. 7 percent of sales at Unilever consists of spreads, with a significant amount consisting of butter substitutes, the sales of which are on the decline. In 2016, there were $248.4 million in sales of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and $47.7 million of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light. ==UK rebranding== In February 2017, Unilever rebranded the product as "I Can't Believe It's So Good... For Everything!" in the UK. The stated objective was to increase awareness of the product's versatility. The rebrand was greeted with puzzlement and some derision by many media commentators. Subsequently, the branding was simplified to "I Can't Believe It's So Good...". The brand was returned to its original form in November 2019. ==See also== *Margarine *Stork (margarine) ==References== ===Additional sources=== * * * ==External links== *USA Website *UK Website Category:Former Unilever brands Category:Margarine brands Category:Products introduced in 1981 Category:Upfield (company) brands
18541778	I Can't Drive 55	"I Can't Drive 55" is the lead single and first track from Sammy Hagar's eighth studio album VOA in 1984. Perpetuated by a very successful music video, it became a concert staple that continued throughout Hagar's tours as a member of Van Halen. The song is a reference to the since-repealed National Maximum Speed Law that set speed limits at in the United States. It is the 100th song on VH1's 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs. ==Song origin== Hagar wrote the song in response to receiving a speeding ticket in New York State, for driving on a road with a speed limit, which was the highest permissible speed limit in the United States at the time due to the National Maximum Speed Law enacted in 1974. Hagar explained in an interview: ==Music video== The song's music video was directed by Gil Bettman. The video was shot on location at the Saugus Speedway in Santa Clarita, California. The song's video includes Hagar and his band being chased and jailed by the California Highway Patrol for traffic violations. The video shows Hagar driving a black Ferrari 512 BBi which is later tuned up by Hagar's mechanic, Claudio Zampolli. Zampolli was driving the Ferrari during the video's opening shot, where the Ferrari fish-tails across the speedway. Hagar claims in the commentary for the video on the DVD, The Long Road to Cabo that he burned out his clutch during the video. Hagar drove a 512, but a 308 was also used. Hagar claims it cost him $5800 to fix. A trial scene is presided over by a judge played in a cameo appearance by John Kalodner. The judge's props were borrowed from director Robert Zemeckis, director of the 1980 film Used Cars. Sets were built and the video was shot during the summer. There was no air conditioning in the jailhouse set, so the cast and crew were hot. The yellow jumpsuit, worn by Hagar in the video, can be seen at the New Orleans Hard Rock Cafe. A stuntman was used for Hagar's stunts. An exploding ramp was used to throw Hagar across the courtroom. ==Track listing== #"I Can't Drive 55" (Sammy Hagar) – 4:12 #"Dick in the Dirt" (Sammy Hagar) – 4:19 == Personnel == * Sammy Hagar – lead vocals, lead guitar * Gary Pihl – rhythm guitar, backing vocals * Jesse Harms – keyboards, backing vocals * Bill Church – bass guitar, backing vocals * David Lauser – drums, backing vocals ==Chart performance== Chart (1984-85) Peak position US Billboard Hot 100 26 ==Additional placements== The song has been a signature track for Hagar during and after his tenure with Van Halen, and is commonly used on TV programs and commercials related to automotive racing. *Most recently, the song was featured in a NAPA Auto Parts commercial, where NASCAR drivers Michael Waltrip and teammate Dale Jarrett are asking Hagar to keep the noise down during a recording session; in response, Hagar asked Waltrip if he could drive faster. Waltrip's car number at the time of the 2007 commercial was No. 55 and he had failed to qualify for some races. *In 2001, NBC Sports had Hagar record a "corrected" version titled "I Can't Drive 65", reflecting the common speed limit on freeways at that time (six years after the National Maximum Speed Law was repealed), for use during Budweiser Pole Award presentations on Winston Cup Series broadcasts on NBC and TNT. It was used from 2001 to 2003 during the broadcasts. *The accelerated version of the song was also available as a download for NHL Rivals 2004. *The song was the opening theme for ESPN's NASCAR coverage for the 2012 season. *The song is featured as a playable track in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades and Guitar Hero Live. *"I Can't Drive 55" was an achievement and Easter egg found in Forza Motorsport 4 for driving a 1984 Ferrari GTO faster than 125 mph, in homage to the 1984 Ferrari 512 BBi used in the music video and the "Write me up for 125" line in the song. *The song is featured in an R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 US commercial. *The song is featured in the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II, when Marty McFly discovers he has returned to an alternate, hellish version of 1985 Hill Valley, replete with strip joints, pawn shops, and in the center of it all, a huge 27-story casino hotel called "Biff's Pleasure Paradise", featuring villain Biff Tannen's face. At other points of the film and in its predecessor, Marty goes back to the year 1955 by driving in a time machine in the form of a very fast car. *The song is featured in the 1985 film Moving Violations when Scott Greeber and Stephanie McCarty borrow a car and go cruising at high speeds. *The song is on the soundtracks of NBA 2K18 and Twisted Metal. *The song is used in the 2018 film Bumblebee. *The song is played when Niklas Kronwall of the Detroit Red Wings and Noah Hanifin of the Calgary Flames score goals at home. *In 2021, Sammy Hagar performed this song live at the NASCAR All-Star Race at Texas Motor Speedway during the warmup lap before the race began. ==Pop culture== The American punk rock band Minutemen named their album Double Nickels on the Dime as a protest against the song.

18635112	I Can Sing a Rainbow	"I Can Sing a Rainbow," also known simply as "Sing a Rainbow," is a popular song written by Arthur Hamilton. It was featured in the 1955 film Pete Kelly's Blues, where it was sung by Peggy Lee. ==Background== The song has been used to teach children names of colours. Despite the name of the song, two of the seven colours mentioned ("red and yellow and pink and green, purple and orange and blue") – pink and purple – are not actually a colour of the rainbow (i.e. they are not spectral colors; pink is a variation of shade, and purple is the human brain's interpretation of mixed red/blue [see line of purples]). They are also not presented in order of the visible light spectrum. ==Versions== *Andy Williams released a version on his 1964 album, The Wonderful World of Andy Williams. *David and Marianne Dalmour used the song as first track of their LP Introducing David and Marianne Dalmour. *The British pop singer Cilla Black recorded the song for her 1966 studio album, Cilla Sings a Rainbow; the album title and cover sleeve were both inspired by the song. Black's second album was a commercial success, charting at number 4 on the UK Albums Chart.

It was written by Aron Eli Coleite and directed by David Von Ancken. The episode aired on October 6, 2008. The title is a reference to a phrase from the Bhagavad Gita and was famously quoted by J. Robert Oppenheimer: "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." ==Plot== Peter travels four years into the future with his future self, where they discover Kaito's formula is being used to administer adrenal power enhancements to ordinary people, some of whom are unable or unwilling to control their abilities.

Peter finds that a friendly Sylar has reassumed his former identity of Gabriel Gray, and is now raising his young son, Noah, in Claire's former home. Gabriel reluctantly teaches Peter his power, warning him that the power comes with an uncontrollable hunger. Future Claire, Knox and Daphne show up to kill Peter. Gabriel beats Knox into submission and loses control of his radiation ability after his toddler son is killed during the fight. Peter tries in vain to stop Gabriel before he explodes, reducing Costa Verde to nuclear waste. Claire takes Peter back to the base.

In the present, Tracy attempts to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. Nathan flies in and saves her. Throughout the episode, Mohinder is researching a possible cure for the powers he's given himself. Hiro and Ando finally resolve their differences.

1868136	I Am the World Trade Center	I Am the World Trade Center is an American synthpop duo consisting of musician Daniel Geller (co-founder of Kindercore Records) and vocalist Amy Dykes. Geller creates almost all of the music using his laptop, occasionally using drum machines, keyboards, or other instruments. ==History== Geller co-founded Kindercore Records with Ryan Lewis in 1996 in Athens, Georgia, United States. Lewis, Geller, and Dykes soon moved to New York City, and Geller and Dykes began dating in 1997. When Geller asked Dykes to provide the vocals for an instrumental track he had written, they considered starting a band. With encouragement from Lewis, they played a live performance in Austin, Texas, at the 2000 South by Southwest festival. Geller and Dykes had decided on the name in 1999 while living in New York City. The band's debut album, Out of the Loop, was released in 2001 on the Kindercore label and according to a 2002 interview with The Stanford Daily, the band's name represented the dynamic of the duo's relationship: "The two towers, equal and independent, together made up one entity and came to represent the relationship that Geller and Dykes forged professionally and personally." The duo's second album, The Tight Connection, was also released on Kindercore in 2002. After Kindercore folded, their third album, The Cover Up, was released on Gammon Records. Dykes and Geller were no longer involved romantically by that time, but they continue to collaborate professionally. ===9/11=== After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, I Am the World Trade Center toured briefly under the shortened name "I Am the World...", but resumed playing under their original name. ===Health problems=== In April 2004, Dykes was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Dykes underwent chemotherapy and faced several complications, but her cancer went into remission in late 2004. I Am the World Trade Center began touring again in March 2005. ==Discography== * Out of the Loop (2001) * The Tight Connection (2002) * The Cover Up (2004) ==References== * Sands, Ryan (Nov. 15, 2002).

18691605	I Can Feel You	"I Can Feel You" is a song by American pop singer-songwriter Anastacia. It was written by Ne-Yo and Chuck Harmony and produced by the latter for her fourth studio album, Heavy Rotation (2008). Her first new material in over three years, the dance pop song was released by Mercury Records as the album's lead single in October 2008. It became a top ten hit on the Slovakian Rádio Top 100 chart and reached the top 20 in Austria, Hungary, Italy, and Sweden. ==Background== "I Can Feel You" was written by American R&B; singer Ne-Yo and commissioned after her record company had suggested a more "urban dance" sound for her fourth studio album, Heavy Rotation. Commenting on his contribution, Anastacia elaborated in 2009: "I really didn't want to get turned down. I think the worst feeling would be asking someone to write a song for you and them to turn round and say: "No." So I was so grateful that he knew who I was and then the fact that he wrote two songs. The first tone he wrote, "I Can Feel You" was hands down like the perfect song that reflected how I was feeling about my life and my love life. It's been lovely working with him. He is a really charming and down to earth guy." In 2017, Anastacia admitted in an interview with Attitude that the song "just wasn't my vibe." ==Critical reception== This song received mixed to negative reviews. In his album review album the song's parent album, Alex Fletcher from Digital Spy wrote: "Make Anastacia relevant to the generation brought up on Amy Winehouse and The Pussycat Dolls rather than Mariah and Whitney. The low-key disco" of lead single "I Can Feel You" decent indication of Anastacia's intentions." He also compared the song to that time recent Britney Spears singles. Fletcher's colleague, Nick Levine reviewed the single: "Sadly, 'I Can Feel You' isn't the big comeback single she needs after what in pop terms is a fairly lengthy hiatus. It begins promisingly with a lightly funky disco groove, but the chorus lacks the oomph that turned "Left Outside Alone" and "I'm Outta Love" into radio favourites." Allmusic editor Jon O'Brien also disked the single release of the song: "Lead single "I Can Feel You" misleadingly suggests that this doesn't seem like a particularly wise decision. Written by man of the moment Ne-Yo, its promising opening funky beats and squelchy synths are let down by such a non-event of a chorus that it's hard to believe it's penned by the same man behind Rihanna's recent infectious chart hits. A prime example of using a star name just for the sake of it, it's arguably the most underwhelming comeback song of the year." Ian Gittins of Virgin Media praised vocal performance: "Her asbestos larynx is in full effect on Heavy Rotation, rasping through R&B-hued; lead-off single "I Can Feel You." ==Music video== A music video for "I Can Feel You" was directed by Chris Applebaum and filmed in Los Angeles. It consists of Anastacia in four different settings, having no real concept. The first is Anastacia in a smoky alley wearing a silver dress, dancing and hopping around. The second is the singer in black leather pants, laying on a chair, surrounded by green lights. The third setting includes Anastacia fully naked in a bathtub, covering her breasts with her hands and arms. The final setting shows her wearing a second silver dress and a huge feather boa, dancing and singing in front of a wall. These four settings are intertwined with backstage footage of the videoshoot, including footage of Anastacia's husband, sister and her dogs. The final clip had its official premiere on September 14, 2008. ==Promotion== Anastacia performed "I Can Feel You" in 2008 at the following events: * on September 29 on Operacija trijumf ("Operation Triumph"), the Serbian version of Star Academy. * on October 20 on ¡Mira quién baila!, the Spanish version of Dancing with the Stars. * on October 28 at the "Pink Ribbon Gala" in Stockholm, Sweden. * on November 25 on Serata d'Onore, an Italian TV show which aired on Rai Due. * on November 23, at "Divas II", a benefit concert in England which aired on ITV1. * on November 28 at "Energy Stars for Free 2008", a benefit concert in Zürich, Switzerland. * at 95.8 Capital FM's Jingle Bell Ball on December 10.

18758848	I Am Rich	I Am Rich is a 2008 mobile app for iPhones which had minimal function and was priced at . The app was pulled from the App Store less than 24 hours after its launch. Receiving poor reviews from critics, only eight copies were sold. In the years since, several similar applications have been released at lower prices. ==Overview== I Am Rich was developed as a joke by German software developer, Armin Heinrich, after he saw iPhone users complaining about software priced above . The app only showed a glowing red gem and an icon that, when pressed, displayed the following mantra in large text: Heinrich told The New York Times that "I regard it as art. I did not expect many people to buy it and did not expect all the fuss about it." The application is described as "a work of art with no hidden function at all", with its only purpose being to show other people that they were able to afford it. Vox writer Zachary Crockett called it "the ultimate Veblen good in app form". ==Release== Heinrich released and distributed I Am Rich through the App Store on August 5, 2008. The app was sold for , (), and --the highest prices Apple allowed for App Store content. The application was removed from the App Store without explanation by Apple less than a day after its release. ===Purchases=== Eight people bought the application, at least one of whom claimed to have done so accidentally. Six US sales and two European sales netted $5,600 for Heinrich and $2,400 for Apple (respectively equivalent to $ and $ in ). In correspondence with the Los Angeles Times, Heinrich told the newspaper that Apple had refunded two purchasers of his app, and that he was happy to not have dissatisfied customers. ==Reception== Discussing the app on the website Silicon Alley Insider, Dan Frommer described the program as a "scam", "worthless", and finally "a joke that smells like a scammy rip-off" on August 5, 6, and 8, respectively. Without purchasing the app, Fox News' Paul Wagenseil guessed that the secret mantra was "German for 'Sucker! (Heinrich is German). Wired's Brian X. Chen described I Am Rich as a waste of money to "prove you're a jerk", and contrasted the expenditure with donating to cancer foundations and Third World countries. Heinrich told the Los Angeles Times Mark Milian that he had received correspondence from satisfied customers, "I've got e-mails from customers telling me that they really love the app [... and that they had] no trouble spending the money". In an interview with The New York Times, though, he told of receiving many insulting emails and telephone messages. ==Similar applications== The next year, Heinrich released I Am Rich LE. Priced at , the new app has several new features (including a calculator, "help system", and the "famous mantra without the spelling mistakes") to meet Apple's requirement that apps have "definable content". Some customers were disappointed by the new functionality, poorly rating the app due to its ostensible improvements. On February 23, 2009, CNET Asia reported on the "conceptually similar" app, I Am Richer, developed by Mike DG for Google's Android. The app was released on the Android Market for , a limit imposed by Google, who had no objection to the application. With the same name, the I Am Rich that was released on the Windows Phone Marketplace on December 22, 2010 was developed by DotNetNuzzi. Described by MobileCrunch as equally useless as the original, this app cost , the price cap imposed by Microsoft. ==See also== * ==References== Category:2008 software Category:discontinued iOS software Category:iOS software Category:mobile applications Category:novelty software
18865544	I Can't Get Over You (Brooks & Dunn song)	"I Can't Get Over You" is a song written by Ronnie Dunn and Terry McBride, and recorded by American country music duo Brooks & Dunn.

18996233	I Ain't Got Nobody	"I Ain't Got Nobody" (sometimes referred to as "I'm So Sad and Lonely" or "I Ain't Got Nobody Much") is a popular song copyrighted in 1915. Roger A. Graham (1885–1938) wrote the lyrics, Spencer Williams composed it, and Roger Graham Music Publishing published it. It was first recorded by Marion Harris, and became a perennial standard, recorded many times over following generations, in styles ranging from pop to jazz to country music. The 2008 film Be Kind Rewind uses the version recorded by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, although two covers were recorded for the film as well: a piano solo version by Jean-Michel Bernard, and a Fats Waller-esque version by Mos Def. == Attribution == Chicago and Saint Louis ragtime pianist and blues composer Charles Warfield (1878–1955) claimed to have originally written the song and a copyright dated April 1914 attributes Warfield as the composer, David Young as the lyricist, and Marie Lucas as the arranger. The title of the song is given as "I Ain't Got Nobody and Nobody Cares for Me". Spencer Williams' copyright entry from 1916 under a shorter title attributes the composition to Davy Peyton and himself and the lyrics to publisher Roger Graham. In 1916, Frank K. Root & Co., a Chicago publisher (né Frank Kimball Root; 1856–1932), acquired the Craig & Co. copyright, and, later that year, also acquired the Warfield-Young copyright. Clarence E. Brandon Sr. and Billy Smythe, both St. Louis musicians, both claim that they wrote the first version, words and music, of "I Ain't Got Nobody", filed two copyrights 1911, and published it that same year. =="Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody" medley== thumb|right|250px "I Ain't Got Nobody" is best known in a form first recorded by Louis Prima in 1956, where it was paired in a medley with another old standard, "Just a Gigolo". Prima started pairing the songs in 1945 and the idea was revisited in the popular arrangement in a new, jive-and-jumping style, created by Sam Butera for Prima's 1950s Las Vegas stage show. The success of that act gained Prima a recording deal with Capitol Records, which aimed to capture on record the atmosphere of his shows. The first album, titled The Wildest! and released in November 1956, opened with "Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody", which then became Prima's signature number and helped relaunch his career. Butera is noted for his raucous playing style, his off-color humor, and the innuendo in his lyrics. The arrangement he made with Prima of "Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody" has been covered by David Lee Roth and The Village People. The Village People recorded a disco version of the "Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody" medley for their 1978 album Macho Man. Although the two songs have nothing else in common, the popularity of Prima's combination, further popularized by David Lee Roth on his 1985 EP Crazy From The Heat, has led to the mistaken perception by some that the songs are two parts of a single original composition. In 2017, the Spanish band De Morao Swing Tablao released a version of this song by double pairing it with the popular Spanish song, "María de la O". ==See also== * List of pre-1920 jazz standards ==References== ==External links== * * - Jazzmania Quintet, with Georgie Stoll on Stroh violin, playing I Ain't Got Nobody Category:1915 songs Category:1910s jazz standards Category:Bessie Smith songs Category:Sophie Tucker songs Category:Songs written by Spencer Williams Category:Cab Calloway songs Category:Village People songs
19079582	I Can Stand a Little Rain	I Can Stand a Little Rain is the fourth studio album by Joe Cocker, released in August 1974, and considered to be the singer's finest album in that decade. ==Background== In 1973, in the midst of uncertainty career-wise, Joe Cocker teamed up with Jim Price, a trumpet player turned producer, who had previously been member of Cocker's touring band. "Jim rekindled my interest," Cocker said in an interview for "Blank Space" in 1979. "Jim called and played me 'You Are So Beautiful', he just came round the house and said, 'What's wrong?' And he played me 'I Can Stand a Little Rain,' which turned out to be the title of the album. The two things that kind of re-fired me into work again, and consequently drove me insane in the process." I Can Stand a Little Rain found the singer working with top songwriters and session players, including Chuck Rainey, Cornell Dupree and Bernard Purdie, as well as future Toto founder members David Paich and Jeff Porcaro. Some of the writers, like Randy Newman and Jimmy Webb, ended up performing on Cocker's covers of their songs. The album is, however, particularly noticeable for the song "You Are So Beautiful", originally released on Billy Preston's The Kids & Me album. Ultimately, it went on to become one of Cocker's bigger hits, reaching No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100, proving this album to eventually become a hit. The original idea was that of a double album but A&M; did not approve of it. The rest of the songs recorded during the sessions were released in April 1975 on Cocker's next album Jamaica Say You Will, which was not equally successful. In 2013, "The Moon's a Harsh Mistress" was re-recorded by Jimmy Webb in a duet with Joe Cocker. It turned out to be Cocker's final recorded performance. ==Track listing== ;Side One ;Side Two == Personnel == * Joe Cocker – lead vocals * David Paich – acoustic piano (1, 8) * Nicky Hopkins – acoustic piano (2, 6, 7) * Richard Tee – acoustic piano (3), organ (3) * Jimmy Webb – acoustic piano (5) * Peggy Sandvig – organ (6) * Greg Mathieson – acoustic piano (9) * Randy Newman – acoustic piano (10) * Ralph Hammer – guitar (1) * Ray Parker Jr. – guitar (1, 8, 9) * Jay Graydon – guitar (2, 4, 8, 9) * Henry McCullough – guitar (2, 6) * Cornell Dupree – guitar (3) * Dave McDaniel – bass (1, 2, 7-9) * Chuck Rainey – bass (3) * Chris Stewart – bass (4, 6) * Ollie E.

19227900	I Care (album)	I Care is the second studio album by Filipino singer Rachelle Ann Go, released in the Philippines on January 10, 2006 by VIVA Records. The album is an immediate follow-up to her successful self-titled debut album. Its singles include "If You Walk Away", the title track, and "Bakit", a promotional single. The album was released on digital download through iTunes on June 1, 2005.Album information, "I Care - Rachelle Ann Go", iTunes, Retrieved 2010-09-11 To date, the album has sold over 15,000 units in the country, certifying Gold by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry. ==Background== After striking it big with four hit singles from her debut album, Go gears for more successes with her second album. Titled I Care, the album is the result of the tight collaboration of an international line-up of producers, songwriters, arrangers and engineers. Each contribution is meant to showcase the vocal artistry of the 19-year-old Search for a Star champion who has now come to her own as one of the country's finest performers. Go celebrated Christmas 2004 with a Platinum record award for over 30,000 copies sold by her self-titled album. It has since turned double platinum, and has produced the hits "Don't Cry Out Loud", "You and Me (We Wanted It All), a duet with Christian Bautista, "When You Find Your Voice", "From the Start" and "Here I Am Again". Among her other notable accomplishments this year were her successful solo concert debut in Rachelle Ann Go, the Ultimate Champion which was held at the Aliw Theater on April 29, 2005, and her win as the People's Choice for Favorite Female Artist at the 2005 MTV Pilipinas Music Awards, for her rendition of "Love of My Life". Written and produced by Jay Durias of South Border, the song was included in her first album.VIVA Records, News, "Rachelle Ann Releases New Album I Care ", Titik Pilipino, January 10, 2006 ==Production and development== The first single released is "If You Walk Away". Written by Todd Cerney and Skip Adams, the power ballad was produced by Christian De Walden and Carlo Nasi. De Walden, who is one of the top producers in Europe and North and South America, came to the Philippines for the recording sessions at VIVA Entertainment's Amerasian Studios in Quezon City. Along with him came Luca Vittori, one of Italy's leading engineers to record and mix several songs for Go's album. Aside from the first single, De Walden and Vittori also did the ballad "Baby It's Time" and the dance cuts, "Number One", "Palm Reader", "The Sweetest Vice" and "Good Love". De Walden also produced "Days to Come", but the song was mixed at the Studio di Ripetta in Rome by Vanni G. and David Bacon, two of the hottest DJ's in Italy's trendy club scene. The title cut, "I Care", was composed and produced by Vehnee Saturno. Saturno gave Go "From the Start", one of the hits from her first album. This was the song that won her the silver prize at the 7th Shanghai Asia Music Festival in 2005, grabbing the Best Composition award in the competition. Last September, Saturno and Go won first prize in the Best Own Country Song category of the Astana Song Festival held in Kazakhstan for her interpretation of Saturno's "Isang Lahi". Other songs in the album are "Angel", composed by Florian Lormes and Katharina Aliaga Leiva of Germany, and "Thank You", written by singer-composer Yman, both produced by Alwyn Cruz. "It Wasn't Enough" and "Windows of My Heart", a duet with Mark Bautista, were both written and produced by Charles Williams of California. "Bakit", is a composition by actor Chuckie Dreyfus. "Strange Are the Ways of Love" is by Ferdinand Dimadura. A cover of Beverly Craven's "Promise Me" was produced by Eugene Villaluz. ==Critical reception== I Care did not perform well enough commercially. Although, it received positive response from OPM critics. Resty Odon of Titik Pilipino gave the album four out of five stars, saying "With body proportions hewing close to Beyonce perfection, I am of the opinion that the tectonic shift to sultriness in this album is not ill-advised at all". He liked the dance numbers, calling them as "enlightened move". He praised the first single, saying "'If You Walk Away' pegs Rachelle Ann’s voice between Whitney Houston and Celine Dion". However, he felt that Go's voice did not fit on R&Bs; and jazzes like her cover of Julia Fordham's "Promise Me". The review ended with Odon, stating "There’s not a number, though, that borders the category of 'unlikable' in this album [...] so long as she does not overshoot her high-notes limit".Resty Odon, Album review, "I Care - Rachelle Ann Go ", Titik Pilipino, Retrieved 2010-09-11 ==Track listing== # Title Writer(s)Album information, "[ I Care - Rachelle Ann Go]", Allmusic, Retrieved 2010-09-11 Arranger(s)Album information, "I Care - Rachelle Ann Go ", Titik Pilipino, Retrieved 2010-09-11 Length 1 "I Care" Vehnee Saturno Arnold Buena 4:01 2 "Bakit" Chuckie Dreyfus Ferdie Marquez 4:07 3 "Angel" Drez, Rachelle Ann Go Nino Regalado 3:45 4 "Baby It's Time" Lisa Nemzo Ralph Stemmann 3:30 5 "If You Walk Away" Skip Adams, Todd Cerney Christian De Walden, Steve Singer 4:11 6 "Window of My Heart" (with Mark Bautista) Charles Williams Williams 4:41 7 "Strange Are the Ways of Love" Ferdinand Dimadura Voltaire Carandang 4:10 8 "Promise Me" Beverly Craven Vic Oria 4:03 9 "It Wasn't Enough" Williams Williams 4:03 10 "Number One" De Walden, Michael Mishaw, Carlos Toro Montoro, Singer Franco Boccuzzi, Paul Mirkovich 4:15 11 "The Sweetest Vice" De Walden, Mike Shepstone, Stemmann Stemmann 3:40 12 "Days to Come" Diane Birch, Byron Brizuela 4:07 13 "Palm Reader" Alberto Mastrofrancesco, Vito Mastrofrancesco, Singer 3:32 14 "Thank You" Yman Regalado 4:23 15 "Good Love" (bonus track) Bernd Meinunger, Montoro, Alfons Weindorf 4:01 ==Personnel== Credits were taken from Allmusic.Album credits information, "[ I Care - Rachelle Ann Go]", Allmusic, Retrieved 2010-09-11 Production * David Bacon - programming, mixing * Franco Boccuzzi - arranger, keyboards, programming * Walter Clissen - engineer * Vincent Del Rosario - executive producer * Christian De Walden - arranger, producer * Vanni G. - programming, mixing * George Landress - engineer * Paul Mirkovich - arranger, programming * Carlo Nasi - producer * Eric Payumo - mixing * Nino Regalado - arranger * Romer Rosellon - engineer, mixing * Ronnie Salvacion - photography * Steve Singer - arranger, programming, producer * Ralph Stemmann - arranger, programming, producer, synclavier * Eugene Villaluz - producer, supervising producer * Luca Vittori - engineer, mixing * Charles Williams (and his Concert Orchestra) - arranger, engineer, mixing Musicians * Mark Bautista - lead vocals (track 6) * Franco Boccuzzi - keyboards * Dennis Clarke - background vocals * Paulinho Da Costa - percussion * Rachelle Ann Go - lead vocals * James Harrah - guitar * Paul Jackson, Jr. - guitar * Bambi Jones - background vocals * Brandy Jones - background vocals * Abraham Laboriel, Sr. - bass * Sylvia Macaraeg - background vocals * Paul Mirkovich - keyboards * Michael Mishaw - background vocals * Moy Ortiz - background vocals * Rafael Padilla - percussion * Dean Parks - guitar * Tim Pierce - guitar * Ralph Stemmann - synthesizer, keyboards * Charles Williams (and his Concert Orchestra) - performer ==Certifications== Country Provider Certification Sales Philippines PARI GoldProfile, Bio, Albums, Awards, "Rachelle Ann Go ", VIVA Records, Retrieved 2010-09-11 15,000+ ==Release history== Country Release date Format Philippines January 10, 2006 Standard (CD) United States June 1, 2005 Standard (download) ==References== Category:2006 albums Category:Rachelle Ann Go albums

1939099	I Com	I Com is the first solo studio album by French singer and DJ Miss Kittin, released on 31 May 2004 by NovaMute Records. It is Miss Kittin's first solo release, having previously released albums in collaboration with The Hacker and Golden Boy. As in her previous works, electro-funk and electroclash continue to be the primary genres. Most of the tracks on the album were produced by Miss Kittin with either Thies Mynther and Tobi Neumann (producers of Chicks on Speed). House music vocalist L.A. Williams raps on the track "Requiem for a Hit", the album's second single. ==Singles== "Professional Distortion" was released as the album's lead single on 17 May 2004. It peaked at number 83 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 77 on the French Singles Chart. The second single, "Requiem for a Hit", was released on 27 September 2004. It peaked at number 92 on the UK Singles Chart and at number six on the Belgian Dance Chart. "Happy Violentine" was released on 14 February 2005 as the third and final single. It reached number 84 on the UK Singles Chart and number nine on the Belgian Dance Chart. ==Promotion== Miss Kittin released the EP Mixing Me on 19 April 2005. The EP contains remixes of several I Com tracks such as its three singles. ==Critical reception== I Com received generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 73, based on 17 reviews. Joseph Shoo of Drowned in Sound commented that I Com has the "sweet attitude of sheer independent energy" while containing "neural giddiness and cerebral edginess". Likewise, Johnny Loftus of AllMusic described I Com as "the best bits and pieces of the post-everything genres have been rearranged in a newfangled data stream to represent Miss Kittin's very elusive, entirely accessible muse. The alluring result is cool, reloaded." By contrast, Derek Miller of Pitchfork noted that "some of Kittin's lyrical deficits undercut her production." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of I Com. ===Musicians=== * Miss Kittin – vocals ; drums ; programming ; synth break * Otto von Schirach – programming * Tobi Neumann – guitar * L.A Williams – vocals * Thies Mynther – piano ; bass, synths ; programming * Tobi Neumann – programming ; guitar ; vocoder ; bass * Sue.Zuki – vocals * The Hacker – programming ; hectic breathing * Florian – vocals ===Technical=== * Caroline Hervé – production * Tobias Neumann – production * Thies Mynther – production * Rashad – mastering ===Artwork=== * Wolfgang Tillmans – pictures * Miss Kittin – drawings, studio pics * Bente Schipp – graphic design ==Charts== Chart performance for I Com Chart (2004) Peak position Belgian Alternative Albums (Ultratop Flanders) 43 UK Dance Albums (OCC) 6 US Top Dance/Electronic Albums (Billboard) 13 ==References== Category:2004 debut albums Category:Miss Kittin albums Category:Novamute Records albums

1952763	I Am a Rock	"I Am a Rock" is a song written by Paul Simon. It was first performed by Simon alone as the opening track on his album The Paul Simon Songbook which he originally recorded and released in August 1965, only in the United Kingdom. Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, as the American folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel, re-recorded it on December 14, 1965, and included as the final track on their album Sounds of Silence, which they released on January 17, 1966. It was released as a single in 1966, and subsequently included as the B-side of the 1971 A-side reissue of "The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)". == Writing, recording, and commercial success== ===Solo-acoustic version=== Thematically, "I Am a Rock" deals with isolation and emotional detachment. The song was not included on Simon & Garfunkel's acoustic debut album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., which was released on October 19, 1964. Some sources say that it was performed by Simon on January 27, 1965, on a promo show for the BBC.See the bootleg disc Far East Reunion, released by Hard Rain Records (Hard Rain 007/008). Jean-Marc Orliaguet claims (archived July 21, 2006) this show aired on 27 January 1965 (accessed 13 April 2006). This is dubious, however, because the liner notes to Far East Reunion claim this is a promo show for the release of the Simon & Garfunkel EP Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., which itself was not released until 1966. Simon likely began writing the song before the end of January 1964, and had it completed by May 1965, when he first recorded it. It was included on his solo-acoustic The Paul Simon Songbook LP released in the UK in the summer of 1965. Until 1981, the initial recording of "I Am a Rock" on The Paul Simon Song Book remained unavailable in North America. This was partly because Simon himself was dissatisfied with the album, saying on the album's liner notes: > "This L.P. contains twelve of the songs that I have written over the past > two years. There are some here that I would not write today. I don't believe > in them as I once did. I have included them because they played an important > role in the transition. It is discomforting, almost painful, to look back > over something someone else created and realize that someone else was you. I > am not ashamed of where I've been and what I've thought. It's just not me > anymore. It is perfectly clear to me that the songs I write today will not > be mine tomorrow. I don't regret the loss."Paul Simon, liner notes, The Paul > Simon Song Book. London: CBS Records, 1965. As a result, the Song Book album was only made available in North America when it was released as part of the boxed set of albums Paul Simon: Collected Works. The album was not released on CD until March 23, 2004.This date is cited from Paul Maclauchlan's discography of Simon's career (accessed 27 September 2006). For this release Columbia included two bonus tracks, one of which was an alternate take of "I Am a Rock", during which one can plainly hear Simon stamping his foot for a beat. In 1965, the solo-acoustic version "I Am a Rock" was also released as a rare A-side of a single in the UK, backed with "Leaves That are Green". ===Electric version with Garfunkel=== While Simon was in Denmark during the summer of 1965, Tom Wilson, the producer of Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., responded to requests for "The Sound of Silence" from American radio stations and dubbed an electric guitar, bass, and drums onto the original track. He then released the song as a single, whereupon it entered the United States pop charts. When Simon heard about the success of this song, he was still touring in Europe as a solo folk singer. Simon immediately returned to the United States, and with Garfunkel in December 1965 began a series of hasty recording sessions to match the electric "mold" created by Wilson with many of the other songs that Simon had recorded on the Song Book, including "I Am a Rock," which was re-recorded during these sessions on 14 December 1965.Heylin, Clinton, Bob Dylan: The Recording Sessions, 1960-1994, Macmillan, 1997. Cf. pp.34–36. . It mentioned Tom Wilson's use of the technique he tried with Dylan's early recordings, later with Simon and Garfunkel's work. The result was the album Sounds of Silence, which the duo released the following January. "I Am a Rock" was the fifth and closing track on Side 2 of the record. Along with most of the other tracks on the album, it was produced by Bob Johnston and recorded in New York at Columbia Recording Studios using some of the same session players that had appeared on Bob Dylan's recent Highway 61 Revisited LP. The album quickly capitalized on the success of the new album's title track as a #1 single, and itself rose to #21 on the Billboard charts. The duo cashed in quickly on their new-found success. They released "I Am a Rock" as a single in the late spring of 1966,The reference number is Columbia 45 4-43617. and the song reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, the third single (chronologically) by Simon & Garfunkel to reach the top 5 (after "The Sound of Silence" and "Homeward Bound"). This single had two incarnations. First, as a promotion, it was released on red vinyl to radio stations, with a mono mix on one side and a stereo version on the other. These copies are somewhat difficult to locate for collectors. The standard version sold in stores, however, was the black vinyl 45 rpm record with the red Columbia Records label. The B-side was a version of "Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall," which was later released on Simon & Garfunkel's even-more-successful (and critically acclaimed) album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme. The single mix of the song features a more prominent lead vocal track (and different phrasing in the opening lines) by Paul Simon, and less reverb, than the more common LP version. Billboard described the song as a "beautiful lyric ballad." Cash Box described the song as a "hard-driving, pulsating ode about rather isolated young man." ===Personnel=== Credits are adapted from The Words and Music of Paul Simon.

19668798	I Can Football	I Can Football is a 3D multiplayer online soccer game created by the Turkish development house Sobee. The game was supported by Vestel at the beta stage. After Sobee had purchased by Türk Telekom, the game was published by TTnet in 2009. Sobee has recently reached marketing and sales agreements with both STC and Telecom Egypt for I Can Football. The game is published since 2010 in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. == Gameplay == The player moves with the cursor keys. The player's character runs slower when they have the ball. While running the player may sprint with the "Shift" key, but sprinting depletes stamina very quickly. When stamina is depleted the player cannot run and will have to rest to regain stamina. There are two game modes, Pro and Normal. Running in Pro mode drains stamina but in Normal mode running doesn't drain stamina. Players also have gameplay options such as tackling, passing, shooting, freekick, etc. == References == == External links == * * Category:2009 video games Category:Association football video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Video games developed in Turkey
19706670	I Am... Sasha Fierce	I Am... Sasha Fierce is the third studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was released on November 12, 2008, by Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment. In its original release, the album was formatted as a double album, intending to market Beyoncé's dichotomous artistic persona. The first disc I Am... contains slow and midtempo pop and R&B; ballads, while the second, Sasha Fierce (named after Beyoncé's on-stage alter ego), focuses on more uptempo beats that blend electropop and Europop elements. In composing the songs' lyrics, Beyoncé worked with writers, with each session accompanied by live orchestration. Beyoncé credited both her husband—rapper Jay-Z—and jazz singer Etta James for inspiring her to push the limits of her songwriting and artistry. Musically, I Am... drew inspiration from folk and alternative rock, while blending acoustic guitar elements into contemporary ballads, and its tracks were written and produced by Beyoncé, during collaborative efforts with Babyface, Tricky Stewart, The-Dream and Ryan Tedder. Sasha Fierce boasted production from Darkchild and Sean Garrett. I Am... Sasha Fierce received mixed to positive reviews from music critics and was a massive commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of 482,000 units and earning Beyoncé her third consecutive US number-one solo album. The album has earned one diamond and over thirty platinum certifications in separate worldwide markets, being certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) after shipping over six million units in the United States. I Am... Sasha Fierce has sold 10 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. The album garnered seven Grammy Award nominations at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards ceremony (2010), including a nomination for Album of the Year, winning six—the most awards won in one night by a female artist. The album was marketed with the release of several singles, including "If I Were a Boy" and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", both of which charted highly internationally. The former topped the charts in over ten countries and reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100, with the latter becoming her fifth number-one single on the Hot 100 chart. "Diva" and "Ego" were released exclusively in the United States, while "Halo" and "Sweet Dreams" were promoted internationally as the third and fourth singles, respectively. "Broken-Hearted Girl" was released internationally as the fifth single, while "Video Phone" was released in September 2009 as the overall eighth, and "Why Don't You Love Me" was released in July 2010 as the ninth and final single. To further promote the album, Beyoncé made several award show and televised appearances across Europe and America, and embarking on the worldwide I Am... World Tour (2009–10). == Recording and production == The recording of the album took place over an eight-month period. Beyoncé recorded the album in sessions at Bangladesh Studios, PatchWerk Recording Studios, Silent Sound Studios and Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia; Chung King Studios, Electric Lady Studios, Roc the Mic Studios and Strawberrybee Productions in New York City, New York; GAD Studios in Ibiza, Spain; Mansfield Studios and The Campground in Los Angeles, California; South Beat Studios in Miami Beach, Florida; and The Boom Boom Room in Burbank, California. Beyoncé either co- wrote or co-produced all material on I Am... Sasha Fierce. She collaborated with several record producers and songwriters, including Babyface, Stargate (production duo composed of Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen), Tricky Stewart, The-Dream, Darkchild, Sean Garrett, Solange Knowles, Jim Jonsin, Rico Love, Ryan Tedder, Bangladesh, Ian Dench, Dave McCracken, Wayne Wilkins and Blac Elvis. Beyoncé also collaborated with some musicians she had never worked with in the past, such as Toby Gad and BC Jean on "If I Were a Boy"; she also worked again with Amanda Ghost on "Disappear". For the I Am... disc, Beyoncé was influenced by folk and alternative rock genres, while incorporating other instruments she had not normally used previously, such as the acoustic guitar. Tedder specifically assisted Beyoncé with crafting the album's balladry. The ballads were crafted in a way to combine "the best elements" of pop and soul music, while simultaneously "expanding the possibilities of both genres". Beyoncé attempted something different as people had strong expectations from her; she experimented with stronger lyrics. Beyoncé worked with Ghost to re-write Franz Schubert's "Ave Maria" after having co-written "Disappear" in London, England. Ghost told The Daily Telegraph that they were both inspired by their then-recent marriages and had walked down the aisle to "Ave Maria". The song "Smash Into You", featured on the deluxe edition of the album, was originally slated to appear on Jon McLaughlin's sophomore album OK Now under the name "Smack Into You", but was cut from the finalized tracklist after it was leaked online and was subsequently given to Knowles. During the nine-month period between November 2007 and August 2008, Beyoncé recorded over seventy songs and decided during the editing process that she did not want to reconcile the two approaches into one disc. If a song was meaningless to her, she would cut it off during the process of elimination for the final track listing. After a process of elimination, twelve tracks were selected to be placed on the standard edition of the album, while five additional tracks were chosen to make the final cut for the deluxe edition of the album. Beyoncé later revealed that songs from established producers like The Neptunes and Danja were not able to make the final cut. == Music and lyrics == In an interview for Billboard magazine, Beyoncé described I Am... Sasha Fierce as a double album. She said, "One side has songs that are more mainstream and another has my more traditional R&B; songs for my fans who've been there the whole time. Some of it sounds like Barbra Streisand, Karen Carpenter and The Beatles around the 1970s." Music writer Andy Kellman of AllMusic viewed its first disc as "essentially a small set of adult contemporary ballads. Acoustic guitars, pianos, strings, contemplative soul searching, and grand sweeping gestures fill it out, with more roots in '[19]70s soft rock than soul." The second disc, Sasha Fierce, contains consistent electronic influences, which are displayed in songs like "Radio" and "Sweet Dreams". Kellman said in his review that "Diva" resembles B'Day's "Freakum Dress" or "Ring the Alarm" in terms of audacity. Despite being on the Sasha Fierce disc, "Ego", "Why Don't You Love Me" and "Scared of Lonely" were noted to be a meeting ground between the album's halves. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, they resemble Sasha Fierce musically, but thematically and lyrically, they are vulnerable like Beyoncé on the I Am... disc. The album formally introduces Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce. She revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her hit single "Crazy in Love" (2003). In an interview with Emmet Sullivan of People magazine, Beyoncé affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage, with the editor describing Sasha Fierce as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego. "If I Were a Boy", the first single of I Am..., stands as the only song on either disc that Beyoncé did not co-write. BC Jean, who wrote most of the song's lyrics, took inspiration from a poor relationship. Beyoncé explained in Essence that "If I Were a Boy" is different from her previous songs in the sense that it is not a traditional R&B; song. Music critics remarked that the song seemed to be a mixture of her hit single "Irreplaceable" (2006), Fergie's single "Big Girls Don't Cry" (2007), and Ciara's single "Like a Boy" (2007). Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times saw the song's theme of female empowerment as an expansion on that of "Irreplaceable". Musically, "Single Ladies" is an upbeat-dance-pop and R&B; song, and features dancehall and bounce influences. According to Jonah Weiner of Blender, the song makes a clear reference to marriage while Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt that the lyrics had a connection with "post-breakup". "Halo", composed by Ryan Tedder and Evan Bogart, was initially intended for Beyoncé but was almost recorded by Leona Lewis due to Beyoncé's schedule. According to Christian Williams of Billboard, "Halo" has a mainstream pop sound, with subtle R&B; undertones. "Ave Maria" samples Franz Schubert's "Ave Maria". Critics noted "Diva" as a variation on Lil Wayne's "A Milli" and coined it as its female counterpart. "Diva" carries a stuttering beat. "Sweet Dreams" was critically acclaimed for its use of electronic bassline, which some critics compared to Michael Jackson's "Beat It" because of its electropop sound.Montgomery, James (July 9, 2009) Beyoncé Gets Crazy, Sexy, Cool In 'Sweet Dreams' Video. MTV News. MTV Networks. Retrieved February 26, 2011. "Sweet Dreams" is derived from contemporary R&B; and incorporates influences from the classic 1980s funk. "Broken-Hearted Girl" is a midtempo piano ballad. Its production and melody is backed by strings and a drum machine beat. According to Spence D. of IGN Music, "Hello" comes off like another ballad that "populate[s] the first part of the album." It contains the Jerry Maguire line – "You had me at hello" – as part of its chorus. It essentially consists of "sweet guitar-picking and delicate harmonies."Greenblatt, Leah. (November 5, 2008) Review: I Am... Sasha Fierce. Entertainment Weekly. Time Inc. Retrieved on February 26, 2011. According to critics, "Video Phone" contains lyrics that are in reference to "a celebration of Skype sex and putting on a solo show, on camera, for a guy you just met at the club". The remixed version featured both Beyoncé and Lady Gaga trading verses with one another. Musically the song consists of simple lyrics, with hidden innuendos, and is backed by thin-spread beats; Beyoncé and Gaga uttering gasps and groans while singing the song. "Disappear" consists of "sweet guitar-picking and delicate harmonies". "That's Why You're Beautiful" is a slow-tempo soft rock and rock power ballad, which consists of a "grungy" guitar riff and stuterring drums. Critics compared the song with the materials by Alice in Chains and Jill Scott. The platinum edition of the album also included a cover version of Billy Joel's song "Honesty" (1979). == Title and artwork == The album was titled I Am... Sasha Fierce to showcase the difference between Beyoncé and her alter ego Sasha Fierce; the first disc is titled I Am... while the second is titled Sasha Fierce. Making comparisons to a magazine, Beyoncé elaborated that the record was a double album and that it had two covers. The cover artworks for the standard, deluxe and platinum editions of I Am... Sasha Fierce were all shot by German photographer Peter Lindbergh. In a 2021 interview for Harper's Bazaar, Beyoncé revealed that she based the entire project on black and white photography after being told in a meeting discussing analytics that a research discovered that her fans did not like when her photography was black and white. She stated that "it pissed her off that an agency could dictate what her fans wanted based on a survey", pointing out that she was "so exhausted and annoyed with these formulaic corporate companies" and highlighting the album's subsequent great commercial success. == Release and promotion == Beyoncé promoted I Am... Sasha Fierce through various televised appearances and awards ceremonies by performing songs featured on the album from late 2008 until early 2010. Beyoncé's father and then-manager Mathew Knowles held a listening party for the album in New York City on October 22, 2008. Beyoncé first promoted "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" in a concert organized by the Power 105.1 radio station on October 29. Beyoncé first performed "If I Were a Boy" on October 31, on the Japanese music television program Music Station. She later performed “If I Were a Boy” on November 6, at the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards. Soon after, she sang "If I Were a Boy" and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" on November 9, at the 2008 World Music Awards in Monaco. She then took to the stage of The Oprah Winfrey Show to perform "If I Were a Boy" on November 13. She appeared on Saturday Night Live on November 15, where she sang "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". On November 16, Beyoncé sang a medley of "If I Were a Boy", "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", and "Crazy in Love" during the final episode of Total Request Live. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released in the United States on November 18, 2008, and previously in Japan on November 12, in Australia and Germany on November 14, and in France and the United Kingdom on November 17; deluxe edition of the album was released simultaneously with the standard edition. Beyoncé performed "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" on BET's 106 & Park on November 18, at the 2008 American Music Awards on November 23, on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on November 25, on Today the following day, and on The Tyra Banks Show with two male dancers, on January 9, 2009. Beyoncé's first live performance of "Halo" was at the 40th NAACP Image Awards on February 12, 2009. She later performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman after an interview on April 22, 2009. On June 16, 2009, Above and Beyoncé: Video Collection & Dance Mixes was released, composed of a CD of dance remixes to the singles from the album, including the remix of "Ego" with rapper Kanye West, and a DVD featuring music videos previously released for those singles, as well as behind-the-scenes footage. Beyoncé was due to perform "Sweet Dreams" at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13; however, she only performed the bridge from the song at the beginning of her performance, before switching to "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". The platinum edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce was released in Australia on Beyoncé's twenty-eighth birthday on September 4, 2009, and in the United States on October 20, 2009; it included a cover version of Billy Joel's song "Honesty" (1979). Beyoncé performed "Sweet Dreams" at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards on November 5. The deluxe edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce was reissued in the United States on November 23, 2009, including all of the previously released songs in addition to the new songs "Poison" and the remix of "Video Phone" with Lady Gaga. An extended play (EP) titled I Am... Sasha Fierce – The Bonus Tracks was released the same day for digital download in the United States, featuring the latter songs, along with Why Don't You Love Me. Beyoncé performed "If I Were a Boy" on January 31, 2010, at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, along with a cover of Alanis Morissette's song "You Oughta Know" (1995). In February 2010, the bonus track "Why Don't You Love Me" from the album's multiple reissues, climbed up the US Dance Club Songs, eventually taking the top spot and becoming Beyoncé's thirteenth number-one hit on the chart. On May 4, 2010, a full-length music video appeared online after its release as a promotional single. To further promote the album, Beyoncé embarked on the I Am... World Tour, which started in Edmonton, Canada on March 26, 2009. The European leg of the tour started on April 26 in Zagreb, Croatia, and ended on June 9 in London, England. On June 21, she began the third leg of the tour in the United States and finished in August with the I Am... Yours four-day revue at Encore Las Vegas on the Las Vegas Strip. Starting on September 15, 2009, the fourth leg began in Melbourne, Australia and finished on September 24 in Perth, Australia. Beyoncé then went on to perform in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, and the United Kingdom, before finishing the 2009 portion of the tour on November 24 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The tour had its final leg in February 2010, visiting Latin America. Starting on February 4 in Florianópolis, Brazil, she visited five other places before ending in Trinidad on February 18. According to Pollstar, the 2010 shows earned $17.2 million, which added to the total of $86 million for the first 86 concerts in 2009, bringing the tour total to $103.2 million for 97 shows. The I Am... Yours residency at the Encore Theater in Las Vegas was recorded on August 2, 2009, and later released as a DVD, audio CD and television special in late November 2009 titled I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas. Various performances on the tour were filmed worldwide for a live DVD, I Am... World Tour, which was released on November 30, 2010. == Singles == On October 8, 2008, Beyoncé premiered two lead singles from the album. "If I Were a Boy" peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100, topped eight charts worldwide and reached the top ten on many other charts. "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" was the second lead single and peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Beyoncé's fifth number-one single, and was also successful in other international markets, peaking within the top ten around the world. The singles were certified double platinum and quadruple platinum, respectively, by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). "Diva" was released exclusively in the United States and peaked at number nineteen on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Beyoncé's twelfth top-twenty single, and at number three on the US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs. It was certified gold by the RIAA. The next single, "Halo", was released internationally and peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, proving to be commercially successful and reaching top ten around the world. It was certified double platinum by the RIAA on January 5, 2010. Following announcements of the I Am... World Tour two more singles were initially lined up, namely "Broken-Hearted Girl" and "Sweet Dreams"—though they switched order to become the sixth and seventh singles, respectively. "Sweet Dreams" reached the top ten in most countries, including the United States, managing to top the New Zealand Singles Chart, and was certified platinum by the RIAA on January 5, 2010. "Broken-Hearted Girl", the seventh single, reached the top forty on charts around the world, despite never being certified nor released in the United States. "Video Phone" was released as the eighth single from I Am... Sasha Fierce on September 22, 2009, with an accompanying music video and digital download release, taking form as an extended remix featuring American recording artist Lady Gaga. Like its predecessor, it reached the top-forty on charts around the world, peaking at number sixty-five on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also became Beyoncé's fourteenth number-one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs. "Why Don't You Love Me" was released as the ninth and final single on July 2, 2010, and peaked atop the US Hot Dance Club Songs, before its official single release. As of July 2010, the digital tracks from the album had sold a combined total of 12.3 million units in the United States; and according to Columbia Records the album has sold fifteen million digital singles worldwide. == Critical reception == I Am... Sasha Fierce received mixed to positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 62 (indicating "generally favorable reviews"), based on 24 reviews. Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani wrote that the album's "strength" is "its individual songs ... a testament to Beyoncé as one of today's most reliable singles artists", but felt that "the real disparity is her inability to reconcile the adult-contemporary schmaltz of I Am with the more modern, edgy sounds of Sasha Fierce." Adam Mattera of The Observer felt that both discs lack depth, observing that the first is "too busy chasing radio formats to expose any genuine soul", and criticizing the second disc's "succession of independent woman anthems such as 'Single Ladies' and 'Diva', which will no doubt inspire drag queens the world over but leave most others bemused." AllMusic's Andy Kellman called its double-disc "gimmick" "flimsy" and favored its second disc's "decent, if easily forgettable, upbeat pop."Kellman, Andy. [ Review: I Am... Sasha Fierce]. AllMusic. All Media Network. Retrieved on April 20, 2019. He expressed that on the I Am... disc, "Beyoncé feels each line to the fullest extent, which almost rescues the set's staidness." In his consumer guide for MSN Music, Robert Christgau named it the "dud of the month", indicating "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought".Christgau, Robert. CG Keys to Icons: Grades 1990–. MSN Music. Retrieved on March 1, 2011. He found its "split-personality bit" to be "deeply vapid", only observing "three good songs on this 11-track artifact". Jonah Weiner of Blender commented that "Beyoncé is still a beauty-shop feminist, quick with the smack-downs, and she still describes the rattling rush of love with preternatural poise". Stacey Anderson of Spin commented that its first disc "meanders over [...] down-tempo cuts" and called ... Sasha "an intriguing but diluted direction". The Village Voices Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond felt that the I Am... disc lacks cohesion, but complimented "Sasha Fierce as "brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty," and stated, "each incendiary track challenges you to leave your inhibitions at coat-check." Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted that its slow songs are "full of bland self-affirmation and saggy lines", but wrote that "the "Sasha" disc boasts Beyoncé's most adventurous music yet".Hoard, Christian. (November 18, 2008) Review: I Am... Sasha Fierce. Rolling Stone. Wenner Media. Retrieved on February 28, 2011. Colin McGuire of PopMatters called the album "a little rough around the edges at times" and viewed its Sasha Fierce disc as "a far more compelling trip down dance-lane". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the album offers "two compelling sides" of Beyoncé and stated: "The collection might have been better served had she edited it down to one disc, rather than belabor what ultimately seems like a marketing gimmick. And while fans will surely speculate, there's little in the lyrics that feels more revealing than previous emotional fire- starters." Sasha Frere-Jones from The New Yorker found the album to be "something of a mess", mostly because the alter ego "trips on the idea of redefinition". == Accolades == Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly ranked I Am… Sasha Fierce at number two on her list "10 Best CDs of 2008", stating that "'If I Were a Boy' and 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)' are undoubtedly album highlights; still, the surprise here is how consistently satisfying the rest of it is – even the less showy tracks blossom on repeated listening." Mark Edward Nero of About.com ranked it at the ninth place on his list of the Best R&B; Albums of 2008. Christian Gerard of NBC Washington placed I Am... Sasha Fierce on his list of "Honorable Mentions" while writing the list "Best Albums of 2008". Agence France-Presse, as reported by ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs, recognized I Am... Sasha Fierce as the twelfth best-selling album of 2008. On The Village Voices Pazz & Jop year-end lists, I Am... Sasha Fierce was ranked at numbers three-hundred-and-thirty-three and five-hundred-and- eighty in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The album was ranked at number twelve on the list of the best albums of the 2000s decade in Rolling Stones Reader's Poll. The writers of Entertainment Weekly ranked I Am... Sasha Fierce at number eight on their list "10 Best Albums of the Decade". I Am... Sasha Fierce won a Soul Train Music Award for Best Album of the Year at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards.

197441	I Against I	I Against I is the third studio album by the American rock band Bad Brains. It was released on November 21, 1986 through SST Records with the catalog number SST 065. The best-selling album in the band's catalog, I Against I finds the band branching out from their early hardcore punk style to touch on funk, soul, reggae and heavy metal. It is also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The title track was a Paul Rachman-directed video (Rachman would go on to direct the documentary film American Hardcore). The title I Against I presumably refers to the common Rastafarian phrase I and I, which is used in place of the first-person plural (i.e. we) to signify the union of the speaker, audience, and Jah (God) in love and peace. At the producer's suggestion, the vocals to "Sacred Love" were recorded over the phone from the prison where H.R. was serving time on a marijuana distribution charge. ==Track listing== All songs written by Paul Hudson, Darryl Jenifer, and Gary Miller except where noted. #"Intro" (Jenifer, Miller) – 1:02 #"I Against I" – 2:50 #"House of Suffering" (P. Hudson, Miller) – 2:29 #"Re- Ignition" – 4:16 #"Secret 77" – 4:04 #"Let Me Help" – 2:17 #"She's Calling You" (P. Hudson, Jenifer) – 3:42 #"Sacred Love" – 3:40 #"Hired Gun" – 3:45 #"Return to Heaven" – 3:19 ==Legacy== I Against I has influenced diverse rock artists. Ska punk band Sublime and its follow-up project, Sublime with Rome, frequently cover "House of Suffering" and bassist Eric Wilson said that I Against I inspired them to blend different genres. The Dillinger Escape Plan singer Greg Puciato named it one of the four albums that changed his life, as well as "a critical step" in shaping his vocal style. Max Cavalera of Sepultura states that the beginning of 1996 song "Straighthate" was probably inspired by "I Against I" since his band admired the Bad Brains. According to Harley Flanagan of the Cro-Mags, the verse riff in 1986's "The Age of Quarrel" was based on the last part of "I Against I". Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine mentioned the album as one of his biggest influences. Danko Jones called the title track "one of the greatest songs ever written as far as I'm concerned." Beppo of German punk band Spermbirds affirmed, "I Against I had a huge impact on us, they taught us that you can also be hard by playing slow." "I Against I" was covered by Jeff Buckley in 1992, BoySetsFire and Brother's Keeper in 1999, and Lamb of God in 2018; "House of Suffering" has been covered by Sublime in 1995, Machine Head in 1999 and The Bled in 2005; "Let Me Help" was covered by Potshot in 2000; and "Sacred Love" was covered by Storm Large in 2014. In 2019, Bad Brains rerecorded the title track with rapper Denzel Curry as a guest vocalist for a Spotify single. "Re-Ignition" has been sampled on "Daddy's Home" by Chubb Rock, "Ice Man Cometh" by 2 Black 2 Strong MMG, "Ultrasonic Sound" by Hive (which later appeared on The Matrix soundtrack), and on a remix of the 2004 song "Roll Call" by Lil Jon and Ice Cube. A live version of "Re-Ignition" was featured in Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock. "Re- Ignition" appeared on a 2019 episode of Black Lightning. The Canadian teen drama Degrassi: The Next Generation, which names each episode after a 1980s song, named an episode after the song "I Against I". ==Accolades== Year Publication Country Accolade Rank 1989 OOR Netherlands "The Best Albums of the 80s" 29 1995 Alternative Press United States "Top 99 Of '85 to '95" 9 1995 BigO Singapore "The 100 Best Albums from 1975 to 1995" 99 1999 Tylko Rock Poland "100 Albums that Shook Polish Rock" 39 2000 Terrorizer United Kingdom "100 Most Important Albums of the Eighties" — 2002 Revolver United States "The 69 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time" 32 2003 Blender United States "500 CDs You Must Own Before You Die" — 2004 Les Inrockuptibles France "50 Years of Rock'n'Roll" — 2005 Robert Dimery United States 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die — 2006 Gary Mulholland United Kingdom "261 Greatest Albums Since Punk and Disco" — 2008 VOLUME France "200 Records that Changed the World" — 2008 Tom Moon United States "1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die" — 2016 Loudwire United States "Top 80 Hard Rock + Metal Albums of the 1980s" 49 2016 Classic Rock United Kingdom "The 10 Essential Funk Rock Albums" — "—" denotes an unordered list.

19840009	I Capricorn	I Capricorn is a 1972 album by Shirley Bassey. Following on from the success of her previous two albums, I Capricorn saw Bassey still in the midst of her revival in the 1970s. Some months earlier she had released the single "For All We Know", which had become one of the biggest hits of her career, peaking at No.6 in the UK and remaining on the charts for half a year. This album was released just as the single was leaving the chart and just as her second James Bond theme, "Diamonds are Forever", was entering the chart. Surprisingly, the Bond theme song was not featured on this collection however. The album itself, released in February 1972, made No.13 and remained on the UK album chart for 11 weeks. In the US, Bassey undertook a promotional tour during March which took in 12 cities.I Capricorn CD re-release sleeve notes, David Wells, November 2010 It reached No.94 on the Billboard 200[ US chart position on allmusic] Track "I've Never Been a Woman Before" was subsequently released as a single, but failed to match the success of the first. The B-side, "The Greatest Performance of My Life" (also taken from this album) became a mainstay of her live concerts for the next few years. The album also contained the popular songs "Losing My Mind", "The Look of Love" and John Lennon's "Love". The title track was appropriate in that Bassey was indeed a Capricorn (born January 8). Producer Johnny Harris along with his assistant John Bromley (who also played guitar on the album) penned one song, "The Way a Woman Loves". I Capricorn remains one of the most highly regarded albums by her fans.Album article with reviews Early issues of this album had a metallic gold finish and the artwork was pasted on. I Capricorn was re-issued on CD in 2000 by EMI with alternative artwork. It was later re-released in a double pack with the follow-up album And I Love You So in November 2010. == Track listing == Side One # "I Capricorn" (Larry Grossman, Hal Hackady) 4.30 # "The Look of Love" (Burt Bacharach, Hal David) 3.07 # "The Way a Woman Loves" (Johnny Harris, John Bromley) 3.07 #"Love" (John Lennon) 3.25 #"Where am I Going?"

20077388	I Can't Think Straight	I Can't Think Straight is a 2008 British romantic drama film directed by Shamim Sarif. Based on Sarif's 2008 novel of the same name, the film tells the story of a London-based Jordanian of Palestinian descent, Tala, who is preparing for an elaborate wedding when a turn of events causes her to have an affair, and subsequently fall in love, with another woman, Leyla, a British Indian. The film stars Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth. I Can't Think Straight was produced by Enlightenment Productions and distributed in the United States by Regent Releasing and Here! Films. It was released in different regions between 2008 and 2009. The DVD was released on 4 May 2009. The lead actresses, Ray and Sheth, also starred in Sarif's 2007 lesbian-themed historical drama film The World Unseen. ==Plot== In the upper echelons of traditional Middle Eastern society, wealthy Christian Palestinians Reema and Omar prepare for the marriage of their visiting daughter Tala to Hani in Jordan. But back at work in London, Tala encounters Leyla, a young British Indian Muslim woman who is dating Tala's best friend Ali. Tala sees something unique in the artless, clumsy, sensitive Leyla who secretly works to become a writer. And Tala's forthright challenges to Leyla's beliefs begins a journey of self-awareness for Leyla. After a weekend getaway into the countryside, Tala and Leyla sleep together and the two women begin to fall in love. However, Tala's own sense of duty and cultural restraint cause her to pull away from Leyla and fly back to Jordan where the preparations for an ostentatious wedding are well under way. As family members descend and the wedding day approaches, the pressure mounts until Tala finally cracks and extricates herself. Back in London, Leyla is heartbroken but learns to break free of her own self-doubt and her mother's expectations, ditching Ali and being honest with her parents about her sexuality. When Ali and Leyla's feisty sister, Yasmin, help try to get Tala and Leyla together again, Tala finds that her own preconceptions of what love can be is the final hurdle she must jump to win Leyla back. ==Cast== * Lisa Ray as Tala * Sheetal Sheth as Leyla * Antonia Frering as Reema - Tala's mother * Dalip Tahil as Omar - Tala's father * Ernest Ignatius as Sam - Leyla's father * Siddiqua Akhtar as Maya - Leyla's mother * Amber Rose Revah as Yasmin - Leyla's sister * Anya Lahiri as Lamia - Tala's middle sister * Kimberly Jaraj as Zina - Tala's younger sister * Rez Kempton as Ali - Tala's best friend, Leyla's boyfriend * Daud Shah as Hani - Tala's fiancé * Sam Vincenti as Kareem - Lamia's husband * Ishwar Maharaj as Sami - Kareem's younger brother * George Tardios as Uncle Ramzi * Nina Wadia as Rani the Housekeeper == Critical reception == The New York Times called the film "another weightless confection from the writer and director Shamim Sarif." Autostraddle said that it "stands out for its cultural specificity, truly stunning leads, and endless charm." AfterEllen's review notes, "While the film has a lot going for it, the script is surprisingly paint-by-the-numbers. Viewers familiar with lesbian films will be able to call the ending (and all major points of conflict) long before the credits roll. Also surprising is the number of cringe-worthy lines Ray and Sheth utter." ==Awards== * Best Feature, Audience Award - Miami Gay & Lesbian Film Festival 2009 * Best Feature - International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival Of Canary Islands, 2009 * Best Feature - Afterellen Visibility Awards * Best Feature, Audience Award - Melbourne Queer Film Festival 2009 * Best Feature, Audience Award - Pink Apple 2009 * Audience Award Best Feature Film - Fairy Tales International Queer Diversity Film Festival (Calgary) 2009 * Jury Winner Best Feature Film - Festival Del Mar, Majorca 2009 * Audience Award, Best Feature - Vancouver Queer Film Festival 2009 * Best lesbian movie - The Holebifilmfestival Vlaams- Brabant 2009, Belgium * Jury award for Best Women's Feature - Tampa International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival 2009 * Best Feature Film - Gay Film Nights International Film Festival 2009 ==See also== * List of LGBT-related films directed by women ==References== ==External links== * * I Can't Think Straight at BBFC * I Can't Think Straight at BFI * * I Can't Think Straight at Reeltime Creative Category:2008 films Category:2008 independent films Category:2008 LGBT-related films Category:2008 romantic drama films Category:British independent films Category:British LGBT-related films Category:British romantic drama films Category:2000s English-language films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films based on romance novels Category:Films directed by Shamim Sarif Category:Films set in Jordan Category:Films set in London Category:Films shot in London Category:Lesbian- related films Category:LGBT-related romantic drama films Category:2000s British films
20176767	I Can Understand It	"I Can Understand It" is a soul classic written and originally recorded by rhythm and blues musician Bobby Womack, who originally recorded the song for his top ten album, Understanding, released in late 1972. The Womack version was done in a more blues style. ==New Birth recording== In 1973, New Birth recorded a James Brown-esque style recording of the song with lead singer Leslie Wilson, who sounded like Womack, was vocally influenced by Sam Cooke. Their fast-paced version peaked at number four on the R&B; charts and number thirty-five on the Hot 100. The New Birth version is the better-known version and has garnered praise. ==Other versions== *Bobby Womack's brothers, The Valentinos, also recorded the song. Their version was released as a single, and became a chart hit. *In 1975 Columbia records released a third version of this classic track. The least known of the three, this version by Kokomo, a British-soul group, includes delicately mixed congas with a tempo similar to New Birth's and is perhaps, musically, the funkiest of the three. This version peaked at #13 on the US Disco File Top 20 chart. Lead singer Tony O'Malley's vocal style is reminiscent of [Dr. John]'s. The background harmonies and ad- libs make this an outstanding track. ==References== ==External links== *Kokomo's version Category:1972 songs Category:1973 singles Category:Bobby Womack songs Category:New Birth (band) songs Category:Songs written by Bobby Womack
2021975	I Can't Tell a Waltz from a Tango	"I Can't Tell a Waltz from a Tango" is a popular song, written by Al Hoffman and Dick Manning and published in 1954.

2023560	I Believe I Can Fly	"I Believe I Can Fly" is a song written, produced, and performed by American singer R. Kelly from the soundtrack to the 1996 film Space Jam. It was originally released on November 26, 1996, and was later included on Kelly's 1998 album R. In early 1997, "I Believe I Can Fly" reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached the number-one spot of the Billboard R&B; Singles Chart and remained there for six non-consecutive weeks. Internationally, "I Believe I Can Fly" topped the charts in eight countries, including Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The song received five nominations at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards, winning Best Male R&B; Vocal Performance, Best R&B; Song, and Best Song Written for Visual Media, while losing Song of the Year and Record of the Year. It was ranked number 406 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004. The music video was directed by Kelly with Hype Williams and designed by visual artist and designer Ron Norsworthy. ==Background and composition== In a 2013 interview with The Boombox, R. Kelly was asked about the creative process behind the song: "When I met Michael Jordan on a basketball court at an athletic club — we hooped together in Chicago — he came to me and asked me if I wanted to do a song for his upcoming movie," Kelly said. "I was like, 'Yeah!' I didn't even ask what it was. [Eventually] he let me know what it was, we went to a screening to watch it and that's when I ended up coming up with 'I Believe I Can Fly'. I knew from the first melody that was gonna be the song that was gonna take me out of R&B; and into another genre of music." ==Critical reception== A writer for Associated Press described the song as "majestic" and "gospel-styled", noting that "hearing R. Kelly's booming voice reach a crescendo while backed up by a choir is a rousing performance that will get many replays". Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that it is "highly inspirational" and "embodying the mind-set of the two superstars [Michael Jordan and R. Kelly]". He added, ""If I can dream it, I can achieve it." A great motivator for the children who will flock to the silver screen for Jordan". A reviewer from Chicago Sun-Times viewed it as a "warm anthem"."Flying with MJ R. Kelly's anthem takes off". Chicago Sun-Times. November 14, 1996. Retrieved March 25, 2020. Ross Scarano from Complex said, "Like it or not, R. Kelly's "I Believe I Can Fly" works because of R. Kelly. There's not another singer alive with the same combination of ability, earnest conviction, and personal demons—demons that Kelly believes he needs the listener's support to fight." He added that the singer "calls on strings and a choir and every bit of strength available in his lungs and vocal chords to rise above the broad struggle described in the lyrics." David Browne from Entertainment Weekly opined that the "go-for-it lyrics and florid orchestration seem to have been written with a future Disney musical in mind." Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger noted "I Believe I Can Fly"'s "genuine power as a redemption song" and also called it "the most convincing self-help song". British newspaper Lennox Herald picked it as the "undoubted highlight" of the Space Jam album"."Top Ten debut for Jam anthology". Lennox Herald. July 11, 1997. page 32. Retrieved March 29, 2020. Thessa Mooji from Music & Media described it as a "dramatic ballad". Music Week rated it three out of five, calling it "a smoochy gospel-tinged ballad". They added, "A huge hit in the US and should ignite here." A reviewer for People Magazine labeled it as "schmaltzy but potent". Sunday Mirror rated it five out of ten, writing, "'I believe I can soar' sings R. Kelly but I suppose we should be thankful that he's released a proper song for once instead of those awful rap cover versions which are clogging up the charts these days. It's taken from the film Space Jam and if you bought Toni Braxton's last single and liked The Bodyguard then you will buy this for sure. I believe it will fly to the top of the charts though it makes me sore to say it.""The Sugar and Spice Girls Are Playing It Nice". Sunday Mirror. March 2, 1997. Retrieved December 1, 2020. James L. Brown from USC Today deemed it a "long slow ballad". ==Impact and legacy== In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked "I Believe I Can Fly" number 406 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2012, Complex placed the song at number 24 in their ranking of The Best 90s R&B; Songs. ==Music video== The music video for "I Believe I Can Fly" was directed by Hype Williams. It begins at an old farm, where a young boy is playing with his ball. By the farm lies an autumn yellow cornfield, where R. Kelly starts singing. In another scene, a large screen by the farm are showing clips from Space Jam, while Kelly performs on the ground. Later in the video, the singer sits in an autumn forest. Behind him is the screen where the film's clips are displayed. In the last part of the video, Kelly conducts a large choir in a sports hall, accompanied by an orchestra. After Kelly has sung the last stanzas of the song, the choir claps as the video ends. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Produced and arranged by R.

20515397	I Am Wings	I Am Wings: Poems About Love is a young adult book of poetry by Ralph Fletcher, it was first published in 1994. It was chosen by School Library Journal as one of their best books of 1994. ==Summary== The book contains thirty-one free verse poems about love arranged into two sections, "Falling In" and "Falling Out". The poetic voice is that of a young male and the poems trace the development of a relationship from the beginning with the first poem "First Look" through its demise with the last poem "Seeds". ==Reception== Nancy Vasilakis in her review for Horn Book Magazine said that "The poems, which are easily accessible to younger adolescents, are a good bet for reluctant readers. They will strike home with most teenagers, who'll recognize the feelings expressed here and will appreciate a volume of poetry written entirely in their own language." Patti Sylvester Spencer in her review for The Book Report said "Fletcher's language invites thought through accessible metaphors and meaningful situations relevant to toe contemporary youth." Judy Greenfield in her review for School Library Journal said that "while this book tells a story that has been told before, it does so with fresh images and without clichés." Susan Helper in her review for Reading Today said that "Fletcher deftly captures the kinds of discoveries adolescents make, their tentative explorations of unfamiliar emotions, and the quickness that their emotions change. Rachel E. Schwedt and Janice DeLong in their book Young Adult Poetry said this about the poems, "all are masterfully written and nearly take away the breath of anyone who has ever been in love. These responsive poems are certain to draw passionate discussion and possibly unlock real creative writing among young adults." == Notes == == External links == * Ralph Fletcher's website Category:1994 poetry books Category:American poetry collections Category:Young adult poetry books Category:Atheneum Books books

20641178	I Am... (Beyoncé tour)	I Am... World Tour (sometimes referred to as the I Am... Tour) was the fourth concert tour by American singer-songwriter Beyoncé launched in support of her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). The tour was announced in October 2008 embarked in March 2009 with five rehearsal shows in North America. The tour consisted of 110 shows in total, visiting every populated continent. Preparations for the shows began eight months prior to the beginning of the tour with twelve-hour rehearsals for two months. Knowles described the shows as her best and most theatrical from all of her tours. The set list for the concerts included songs from Knowles' three studio albums as well as several covers of other artists and a Destiny's Child medley. The central theme of the tour was to showcase the difference between Knowles' dual personality; her emotional side and her onstage persona, Sasha Fierce which was also demonstrated in the dual album I Am... Sasha Fierce. The show featured two stages – the main one and a smaller B-stage where Knowles was transferred during the middle of the show. She was backed by an all-female band, female background dancers and a big LED screen. Thierry Mugler collaborated with Knowles on the costumes and had a creative advisor role further working on the choreography, lighting and production. Chris March made the costumes usable for stage and helped in their making. For the ballads, Knowles wore longer dresses while for the performances of the up-tempo songs, more make-up and more revealing outfits were worn. The fashion and Knowles' look and figure received praise from critics. The show was directed and choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. I Am... received acclaim from music critics who praised Knowles' performance abilities calling her the best female performer. A concert in Malaysia was cancelled by Knowles after several Muslim groups tried to ban it although she agreed to tone down her look according to the country's standards. The tour was commercially successful grossing $86.0 million from 93 shows in total. Separate performances of several songs were broadcast on different channels and two concerts were released as live albums; the live performance at the I Am... Yours revue was released in a CD/DVD format in 2009 and footage of the tour was released on the similarly titled live album in 2010. ==Background== In 2006, during an interview with MTV News, Beyoncé introduced an aggressive alter ego, Sasha Fierce, which also served as her stage persona. She added that the persona is a complete opposite of her when not performing by characterizing her as "aggressive... strong... fearless." Beyoncé's third album I Am... Sasha Fierce introduced Sasha Fierce as her alter ego. she revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her single "Crazy in Love" (2003). The plans for a 2009 tour in support of the album were announced in October 2008 by Billboard magazine. The tour dates for the European leg were announced in December 2008. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Beyoncé confirmed that she would be backed by the all- female band which had also accompanied her for her previous The Beyoncé Experience tour (2007). Rehearsals for the tour lasted eight months during which the set list for the shows was also constructed. Beyoncé further revealed that the twelve-hour rehearsals for the tour included dancing the choreography in heels for two months before it commenced. During an interview, Beyoncé emphasized how she needed to prepare to channel her alter ego for the performances. According to Beyoncé, the shows were supposed to be a mixture of several of her musical preferences, including jazz, hip-hop, ballet and fashion. The tour kicked off in late-March 2009 with five rehearsal shows in North America. It officially commenced in late April 2009, at Arena Zagreb in Croatia later visiting six continents, namely the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. The six-week North American leg of the I Am... tour kicked off on June 21 with a show at Madison Square Garden in New York and finished with a four-night residency at Encore in the Wynn Las Vegas from July 30, 2009 to August 2, 2009. The tour finished with a concert at Queen's Park Savannah in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, with 108 shows in total. Beyoncé and her organization, The Survivor Foundation, became the spokesperson for General Mills' Hamburger Helper campaign entitled, "Show Your Helping Hand". The campaign's mission was to provide more than 3.5 million meals to local food banks in North America. Knowles encouraged spectators to bring non- perishable foods to her North American concerts to be donated to the campaign. According to the campaign's official website, nearly three millions meals and over $50,000 have been donated. ==Development== Beyoncé revealed that the hardest aspect of coming up with the tour's set list was managing to fit her decade-long song catalogue in a two-hour show. According to her, the tour was supposed to be more emotional than The Beyoncé Experience in order to reflect the "real[,] raw and more sensitive" nature of the I Am... portion of the double album. Beyoncé expressed frustration that snippets of the show appeared online after the first shows on the opening leg, thus "ruining" the surprise factor of the concert experience; however she also appreciated the fact that it can act as a "little sneak peek" for fans to decide if they indeed want to attend. French designer Thierry Mugler served as the creative advisor while also being responsible for Beyoncé's wardrobe. He contributed in the design of lighting, choreography, production and directed three sequences for the concert. According to his creative vision, the shows were intended to represent mise-en-scène by incorporating technical aspects with fashion in order to capture the emotions behind the songs. He added, "There will be a lot of dramatization and metamorphosis on stage. Some very strong effects have been inspired directly by Beyoncé, and only she could make [them] happen on stage." Onstage, Beyoncé was backed by her ten-piece all-female band, Suga Mama, which included two drummers, two keyboardists, a percussionist, a horn section, three backup vocalists called the Mamas, and a lead guitarist. The show featured two stages, namely a simple main stage with a pop0up set of stairs, an LED background screen, and glass risers for Suga Mama and The Mamas as well as a smaller B-stage in the midst of the audience for the later portions of the show. During the concerts, Beyoncé went through six costume changes; during the breaks, The Mamas harmonized. The set list included songs from all of Beyoncé's three studio albums that had been published, a Destiny's Child medley and several covers of other artists. Several critics noted that the songs on the set list were divided into ballads and more up-tempo songs to coincide with the central theme of I Am... Sasha Fierce – the dual personality of Beyoncé. Beyoncé's costumes were changed in order to coincide with the songs' nature; during performances of ballads, she wore longer white dresses while for the uptempo songs, she had more revealing outfits and make-up. ==Fashion== right|180px|thumb|Thierry Mugler design sketches for the wardrobe of the I Am... tour. The words "Feminine. Free. Warrior. Fierce" were used as inspiration for the look during the concerts. Thierry Mugler served as the main costume designer for the tour. Beyoncé was acquainted to and enraptured by his work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala, titled "Superheroes, Fashion and Fantasy" (2008) where she saw several of his haute couture pieces that were on display. Beyoncé discussed the possibility of using the costumes with Tina Knowles. She met with Mugler in Paris in September of the same year and started exchanging ideas for costume designs and the following month he was contracted as the designer for the tour. While designing, the main concept Mugler wanted to illustrate was the duality between "being a woman and a warrior" through his own creative perception; the words "Feminine. Free. Warrior. Fierce" were the overarching inspiration. He felt, "Sasha Fierce is another aspect of Beyoncé's personality, she is Fierce on stage and Beyoncé in real life... Beyoncé is a very sophisticated 'stage animal', which means that she is truly instinctive. Beyoncé expresses herself through the two aspects of her personality." Furthermore, the elaborate costumes were related to the meanings of the songs performed. A seventy one piece wardrobe was designed for Beyoncé and her dancers and band. For the shows, Beyoncé adopted ten different looks. American fashion designer Chris March also worked with Mugler ensuring the costumes were suitable for stage purposes. On July 23, 2009, March filed a lawsuit against Mugler for allegedly not paying him for the work he did on the wardrobe. Metal pieces, fishnets, gloves, power shoulders and golden leotards were all incorporated in the costumes, the majority of which were form-fitting and exposed the singer's legs. Michael Quintanilla of San Antonio Express-News thought the fashion was akin to a "high-tech Blade Runner world". For the performance of several songs, Beyoncé also wore leopard-print pants and glow-in-the-dark bra with a blinking beacon affixed to her body. The fashion and Beyoncé's look during the shows received praise from critics. Randall King of the Winnipeg Free Press noted that the fashion was inspired by "1970s space movie" fashion by Bob Mackie. Alice Jones of The Independent noted: "[the list of] 30 songs introduces us to any number of different Beyoncés – showgirl, balladeer, feminist, rock chick, gangster queen, cyborg – via off-stage costume changes and a leotard for every mood". Kathy McCabe of The Daily Telegraph noted that the shows featured "some of the most elaborate and revealing costumes of her career" thus far. A writer of the Evening Chronicle wrote that the sparkling outfits managed to capture the singer's personality with looks ranging from "NYPD cop to bride to Wonderwoman and beyond" all the while emphasizing her physique. Holly Burnes of The Daily Telegraph also praised the fashion writing that the singer's look included "one incredible costume after another: from a Mad Max look... to an angelic wedding dress Jay Hanna of The Sunday Times compared Beyoncé's look to a goddess, particularly with the costume she wore for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". ==Concert synopsis== The show started with Beyoncé's silhouette appearing on a smoky stage, walking towards the front while singing several lines of "Déjà Vu". Dressed in a gold leotard and stilettos, she was quickly joined by two dancers in catsuits proceeding to perform "Crazy in Love"; during the performance of the song glitter and confetti were dropped on stage. "Naughty Girl" was performed next as bright orange lights were displayed on stage. For the performance of "Freakum Dress", Beyoncé was accompanied by a guitarist onstage, bending backwards during the song's bridge. "Get Me Bodied" followed, for which the singer was engaging in elaborate dance routines with her background dancers. Following a short break, Beyoncé proceeded singing songs from the I Am... portion of the album, dressed in a white leotard. "Smash Into You" was performed on top of a flight of stairs. For "Ave Maria", her background dancers turned her white dress into a wedding gown by attaching a veil to her head. Excerpts of Sarah McLachlan's "Angel" and Franz Schubert's Ave Maria" were performed at the end. She continued on to sing "Broken-Hearted Girl" wearing a white bustier with a sheer, flowing wrap. Outtakes from the music video of "If I Were a Boy" were Beyoncé appeared to perform the aforementioned song dressed as a cop wearing Ray-Bans and a leather breastplate. Excerpts from Alanis Morissette's "You Oughta Know" and Tupac Shakur's "California Love" were incorporated in the middle of the song.Music World Entertainment (2010) Beyoncé – I Am... World Tour (Liner Notes) Columbia Records. A video interlude directed by Melina Matsoukas was shown set to "Sweet Dreams". The video showed a robotic Beyoncé interacting with a cheetah as a mechanical voice intoned Sasha Fierce. Beyoncé then appeared on stage dressed in a leopard-print leotard to perform "Diva". She appeared at the top of the staircase with her backup female dancers; a video interlude showing a five-year old Beyoncé singing and dancing was shown in the middle of the song. She then sang "Radio" while the clip of her dancing as ac child was still projected on the screen. "Me, Myself and I" was introduced with a brief speech about female empowerment. "Ego" and "Hello" were performed afterwards. The show continued with a short medley performed by her backup singers, The Mamas, followed by another video interlude, featuring Sasha Fierce. Beyoncé appeared on stage after a gong bang; she was lifted out of a 20-foot train by a harness and performed "Baby Boy" while high-stepping and front-flipping above the audience. She was then lowered to the B-stage where she finished the song and continued with a cover Dawn Penn's "You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)". A stripped-down version of "Irreplaceable" was sung afterwards with frequent crowd interactions. Beyoncé then continued with "Check On It" and a medley of Destiny's Child hits including "Bootylicious", "Jumpin' Jumpin'", "Independent Women", "Bills, Bills, Bills" and "Survivor". Performances of "Upgrade U" and "Video Phone" followed. For the performance of the two songs, Beyoncé was accompanied by two female dancers and three male dancers, one of whom recorded a live stream of her with a camera throughout the routine during the performance of the latter song. This was followed by a rendition of "Say My Name" where she interacted with members of the audience, asking them to say her name. The concert followed back at the main stage where for the penultimate section, Beyoncé appeared wearing a gown and singing "At Last". A footage of her performance of the song at Barack Obama's inauguration as President of the United States, video images of civil rights era footage and snippets from her performance of the song in the movie, Cadillac Records (2008) were shown on the screen behind here. "Listen" was performed afterwards. This was followed by a YouTube video interlude featuring imitations of the choreography of "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" performed by fans as well as Barack Obama and Justin Timberlake. Beyoncé then performed the song's trademark choreography accompanied by two female back-up dancers. For the finale, an extended version of "Halo" was performed while the singer descended from the stage to shake hands with fans in the front rows. She then went to the top of the staircase and repeatedly said "I am", awaiting the crowd to say it back. The letters "I am... yours" were displayed on the screen as she exited the stage. ==Critical response== The tour received rave reviews from critics. Mike Ross of the website Jam! rated Beyoncé's performance with 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising the "high-production", the singer's wide vocal range and her "riveting presence". Stephanie Classen of The Star Phoenix remarked, "Beyoncé doesn't really need the bells and whistles of a big stadium show, but it sure makes for an unforgettable concert." Randall King of the Winnipeg Free Press graded the tour 4 stars out of 5 and praised the "back and forth" switch between the double persona throughout the show with the singer exhibiting both "raw energy" and "feeling"-induced ballads. Alice Jones of The Independent emphasized how the singer managed to "sing her heart out" in various musical styles that characterize the show's songs while further praising the energetic choreography and the vocals that range from "caramel smooth to honeyed foghorn". She concluded her review by saying, "Watching Beyoncé sing and strut her stuff can feel at best overawing, at worst, alienating". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times observed that the show would make spectators question themselves how the singer managed to put on a "dazzling show" both physically and organizationally; he further praised the singer's "hollering voice, her imperious movement, her costume changes and the show's crush of concepts with their long tails of reference". Deborah Mcaleese and Lauren Mulvenny of The Belfast Telegraph described the show as "incredible... mind blowing... [and] electrifying". A writer of Evening Chronicle wrote that the show's set abounded with "bling, glamour and, most importantly, enthusiasm", further praising her for the well-coordinated balance between "hit[ting] every note" and following elaborate choreographies. Jay Hanna of The Sunday Times felt that the show's encore ("Halo") was the most memorable moment of the set. She also praised the singer's "enviable" dancing skills, "spectacular production and audio visuals" but noted that some songs "let down" the performance by being less melodic. Jay Lustig of The Star-Ledger described the show as a "bona fide pop spectacle" with futuristic themes throughout. Jim Farber from the Daily News viewed the tour as "a huge upgrade in charm, humor and chops" as compared to The Beyoncé Experience and added that "Beyoncé's presence punctuated her singing like an exclamation point". Describing the show as simultaneously "spellbinding, exhausting to watch and hugely slick", Michael Cragg of musicOMH noted that the highlights included songs from the Sasha Fierce half of the album. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone magazine praised the show, lauding the singer for her work ethic and the ability to execute singing, dancing and posing at the same time. Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, commented "Through six outfit changes, bombastic ballads, high-energy singles and a daring high-wire journey from the stage to the center of the arena, Beyoncé delivered over and over again." A writer of Billboard magazine noted that Knowles "brought all the fierceness" on stage for the tour. The Australians Patrick Emery noted that Knowles showcased her self-assurance and professionalism in "full view". Comparing her performance with Michael Jackson's live shows, Renee Michelle Harris of the South Florida Times writes, "[Knowles] owns the stage with her trademark swagger and intensity... showcasing her powerful vocals without missing a note, often while engaged in vigorous, perfectly executed dance moves". Holly Burnes of The Daily Telegraph noted that the performance was almost inimitable and added "Whether crumping, sweeping across the stage in towering heels, or simply standing still, Beyonce was dynamite, blasting the benchmark for concert performers forever". Simon Colling from The West Australian described the performance as "powerhouse" and added, "Beyonce's high-energy, high-voltage mix of song (loud, commercial R&B;) and dance recalled names like Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin and rapper Missy Elliott... [and] Mariah Carey". Joanna Horowitz of The Seattle Times noted that despite the inclusion of almost 10 different musical styles in the show's set list, the singer's "own [musical] signature" and focus were lacking. Nevertheless, Horowitz praised the singer's performing skills and summarized the concert as "a hip-hop Cirque du Soleil — sequins galore, dramatic dance numbers, and Beyoncé at one point soaring". The Observers Barbara Ellen wrote, "she is a force of nature – delivering one of the most enjoyable well-paced shows I've seen in years". However, she noted that Knowles is "so steeped in professionalism that what should be magical can become mechanical." Noting influences by Tina Turner and Barbra Streisand during the tour, Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times writes: "And she danced like only Beyonce can dance, with a combination of power, grace and smarts that fully unites Broadway choreography with urban street innovations ... Indeed, her production can be seen as a retelling of pop's history from a feminine viewpoint -- and as an argument for Beyonce as the ultimate realization of the female pop dream." Ben Ratliff of The New York Times summarized the tour's concept as "the duality of well-meaning good girl and rapacious animal-robot- dance-titan." Jay Lustig of The Star-Ledger concluded that the album's split personality was reflected in the show naturally enough. However, Barbara Ellen of The Observer wrote, "Another irritant is the much-trumpeted 'duality' nonsense with Sasha Fierce, Beyoncé's alter-ego for her latest album. All 'Sasha' does here is flail about in a video, no different from regular Beyoncé, except for a gold dress and a hairdo that veers dangerously towards Liberace." Similarly, Ann Powers from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the only thing which was not fully realized was the show's "overarching" theme, "Beyonce meant to represent herself as a split personality, tender and open on the one hand, indomitable and rather scary on the other. But Beyonce has chosen the wrong dichotomy to represent herself." ==Commercial performance== Tickets for the American leg of the tour were available for pre-sale for members of Knowles' fan club on April 20, 2008 and the official tickets went on sale to the general public through Ticketmaster on April 25. In late May 2009, Knowles' label announced through a press release that the singer decided to set aside 2,000 seats for each date on her then-forthcoming North American tour at a discounted price of $20. After already selling 1,000 tickets per show for the special low price, the last 1,000 discounted seats for each show were made available to the public on May 29, 2009 through Ticketmaster (with the exception of the artist's four-night residency at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas). Due to the big demand, Sony Music announced additional dates in England, Asia and South America. In May 2009, Knowles' official website was peppered with requests by disappointed fans — from Boston; Anchorage, Alaska; Tampa, Florida; St. Louis and Montreal — who asked from her to come to their towns. Knowles broke her record of concert attendees by selling out the Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo, Brazil, with over 60,000 tickets sold. It was reported to Billboard that as of September 16, 2009, from the 53 shows, Knowles grossed $53.5 million and drawn 667,509 fans from the mostly 15,000-seat arenas. In 2009, the tour was nominated for Eventful Fans' Choice Award at the 6th Annual Billboard Touring Awards. The tour grossed $86 million from 93 concert shows and 108 show total grossed $119,5 million. ==Controversy in Malaysia== In September 2009, it was announced by the Associated Press that Knowles would be bringing her show to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on October 25, 2009, but it would be without some of her usual tricks. After encountering what became familiar opposition from religious groups in a predominantly Muslim country, Knowles agreed to tone down some parts of her act. A spokesperson for the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party stated: "We are against Western sexy performances; we don't think our people need that." However, a rep soon came from the concert's Malaysian organizer, stating that "all parties have reached an amicable understanding" about the performance. He went on saying that Knowles should be regarded as a "role model" and an "embodiment of success" because of her philanthropic work, including campaigns against poverty and domestic violence. The Marctensia promoter further told the Associated Press: "We are confident that Beyoncé's concert will once and for all silence international critics and put Malaysia back on track and move up the ranks in presenting A-list international pop concerts in this region and further boost tourism." However, it was ultimately announced in October 2009 that the concert has been postponed in the wake of accusations by Islamic conservatives that the show would be "immoral and unclean". Malaysian promoter Marctensia said in a statement that the show has been postponed to a future date to be announced shortly, and added "The postponement is solely [the] decision of the artist and has nothing to with other external reasons." Another representative declined to comment on whether the show was postponed due to the heavy criticism it was receiving from religious leaders in the country. The show also faced oppositions by Islamic conservatives in Egypt who branded it as an "insolent sex party" that threatens the Muslim nation's "social peace and stability" and tried to encourage people against going to the concert. Two years prior to the performance, Knowles scheduled a show in Malaysia but backed out due to similar protests regarding her performance. ==Recordings and broadcasts== thumb|200px|left|Knowles performing "Crazy in Love" with Jay-Z during the I Am... tour stop at The O2 arena in London While the singer was on tour, she was asked to perform a Las Vegas residency-type of show. Knowles and her team produced the shows in seven days and entitled it I Am... Yours. She performed an unplugged, acoustic styled show different from the rest of her tour, at the Encore Theater in Las Vegas. The show on August 2, 2009 was recorded and later released as a DVD, audio CD and television special in late November 2009 titled I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas. The DVD was commercially successful peaking at number one on the Nielsen SoundScan Music DVD chart. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Another live CD/DVD of the tour was released as I Am... World Tour in late November 2010. The album contained performances from different stops of the tour blended with personal footage of Knowles' backstage work and thoughts about the tour and her life. It served as the directorial debut for Knowles. The DVD was commercially successful becoming the best selling DVD in the world in 2010. Parts of the show in Vancouver on March 31, 2009 were recorded and have been used for commercial use, as well as photos from the show used in the official tour book and other promotional items. "If I Were A Boy" and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" from the show in New Orleans were recorded and shown on TV One as a part of the Essence Music Festival in 2009. A CD and DVD, released on June 15, 2010, featured her performance of "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". "Crazy In Love", "Freakum Dress", "Get Me Bodied", "Smash Into You" and "Broken- Hearted Girl" from the show in Donetsk, Ukraine, were recorded professionally and shown on TRK Ukraina as part of their footage of the Donbass Arena opening. "Crazy In Love" and "Single Ladies" were professionally recorded at the Summer Sonic Festival in Osaka, Japan and used to promote Knowles' Japanese tour. "Crazy In Love" and "Naughty Girl" were also professionally recorded at the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix F1 Rocks event in Singapore for Channel HD 5 Live coverage. "Crazy In Love" was recorded professionally and shown on Frecuencia Latina from the show in Lima, Peru at the Explanada del Estadio Monumental. ==Opening acts== *RichGirl (North America) *Flo Rida (Australia) *Eva Avila (Canada) *Linda Teodosiu (Austria, Germany and Switzerland) *Ildiko Keresztes and Karmatronic (Hungary) *Marek Ztracený (Czech Republic) *Humphrey (France) *DJ Lester & Abdou (Belgium) *Miguel Simões and Verinha Mágica (Portugal) *Labuat (Barcelona) *Shontelle (England and Ireland) *Jessica Mauboy (Australia) *Zarif (England and Ireland) *Ádammo (Peru) *Ivete Sangalo (Brazil) *Wanessa (Brazil) ==Set list== The following set list is representative of the show on June 21, 2009.

The ceremony involved a dance production dedicated to Ukraine's miners. Local artists Natal'ya Mogilevskaya, Svetlana Loboda and Aliona Vinnitskaya performed Queen's "We Will Rock You". Afterwards, a speech by Victor Yushchenko, president of Ukraine was given. Knowles performed audience of nearly 45,000. *On June 9, 2009, Knowles was joined by George Michael on stage for the performance of "If I Were a Boy". *On June 22, 2009, Jay-Z appeared on stage with Knowles in the middle of "Crazy in Love" and rapped a verse from his song "I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)". *On July 3, 2009, during the Essence Music Festival, Knowles dedicated the performance to Michael Jackson following his death. A video of Knowles at the age five was projected on the screen showing her doing an impression of the artist. Knowles said, "That's when I decided who I wanted to be", stating that Jackson was responsible for the inspiration. She went on to sing "Halo" dedicating the lyrics to Jackson. *On July 16, 2009, Solange Knowles appeared as a special guest during the show which was aimed to benefit the Charles & Phyllis Newman Foundation and Knowles' charitable organization, The Survivor Foundation. *On November 15, 2009, Knowles was joined on stage by Kanye West who performed "Ego", and Jay-Z who rapped his verse on "Crazy in Love". == Shows == List of concerts, showing date, city, country, venue, opening act, attendance and gross revenueBox office score data leg 1 *Box office score data leg 2 * * * * * Sources about the North American leg of the I Am...

2067185	I Can Make a Mess	I Can Make a Mess, formerly I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business, is an American acoustic/alternative rock band, the side project of Ace Enders, lead singer and guitarist of the Early November. == History == === Self-titled album (2004) === Though the self-titled album was originally the only planned official release under the name I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business, time would prove otherwise. The project spawned from Enders' desire to make music different from the Early November. Background noises, such as a television playing, are heard throughout the album until the eleventh track, "End of Background Noise" to symbolize the background noises in one's daily life. The main image in the album artwork is a yard rake, which symbolically counters the maple leaf that is associated with the Early November. The last track, "Salvy", is named after Enders' grandfather. The song "The Best Happiness Money Can Buy" appeared in a movie trailer for Must Love Dogs. === Revival of the band to present (2010–2014) === After the announced indefinite hiatus, Enders began recording music under the band name Ace Enders and A Million Different People. After a couple of albums, Ace decided to re-explore I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business. Enders released his second album under the I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business name on March 23, 2010, entitled The World We Know. A music video was made for the song "Old Man...........................". On September 16, Enders released the third Mess album Dust'n Off the Ol' Guitar. The album featured redone versions of many Early November songs, as well as a couple Ace Enders & A Million Different People songs. The album also featured a new song titled "Growing Pains". There's also three songs from the album that will be released once the sales reach 5,000. These songs include "Pretty Pretty", a remix of "1000 Times A Day", and a full length version of "Decoration". On December 15, Enders released a Christmas-oriented EP titled Happy Christmas. The EP contains one original song titled "Season's Greetings", as well as a cover of "Christmastime Is Here" from the film A Charlie Brown Christmas, and a cover of Charles Brown hit Please Come Home For Christmas. The EP was released Digitally. Enders self-released the fourth "I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business" album, Gold Rush on May 5, 2011. This album was funded through fan donations through Kickstarter. With the Early November reuniting and touring again, Enders has continued to release to support this project. Along with the Early November, the band was signed to Rise Records. In 2013, the band name has been shortened to "I Can Make a Mess". This can be seen on both the latest albums Enola, released on June 11, 2013, and Growing In, released on October 9, 2014. ==Discography== * I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business (2004) * The World We Know (March 2010) * Dust'n Off the Ol' Guitar (September 16, 2010) * Happy Christmas (December 15, 2010) * Gold Rush (May 5, 2011) * Enola (June 11, 2013) * Growing In (October 9, 2014) ==Members== ===Current members=== * Arthur 'Ace' Enders – vocals, guitar ===Past and touring members=== * Jeff Kummer - Bass (2004) * Chris Badami - Drums (2004) * "Ultra" Bill Lugg - Guitar (2004) * Tyler Davis – Drums, Vocals * Robin Gazzara - Keyboard, Backing Vocals * Jennifer Enders - Synthesizer ==References== ==External links== * Facebook * Pure Volume Category:Alternative rock groups from New Jersey Category:Musical groups established in 2003 Category:Drive- Thru Records artists

United States: (n.p.). https://books.google.com/books?id=KjAhAQAAIAAJ The most popular version was recorded by Italian-American singer Frankie Laine, and spent eighteen weeks at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. ==Background== "I Believe" was commissioned and introduced by Jane Froman on her television show, and became the first hit song ever introduced on television. Froman, troubled by the outbreak of the Korean War in 1952 so soon after World War II, asked Drake, Graham, Shirl and Stillman to compose a song that would offer hope and faith to the populace. Froman's commercial recording reached No. 11 in the Billboard charts during a 10-week stay. "I Believe" has been recorded by many others, and has become both a popular and religious standard. ==Frankie Laine recording== Frankie Laine's original version was recorded for Columbia Records on 8 January 1953 at Radio Recorders in Hollywood. It featured Paul Weston and his Orchestra accompanying Laine. Laine's recording spent eighteen non-consecutive weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart. , this record remains unbeaten. "I Believe" was the best-selling single of 1953 in the UK, spending 36 weeks on the chart. It entered the listings on 3 April 1953, and first reached No. 1 in its fourth week on chart, spending nine weeks at the top. On 26 June, it was replaced at No. 1 for a week by "I'm Walking Behind You" by Eddie Fisher featuring Sally Sweetland, but returned to the top spot on 3 July for another six weeks.

Laine also had the most successful version in the US, where his recording reached No. 2, staying there for three weeks. Laine would later re-record the song for other labels on a number of occasions. The first of these was on December 18, 1964 in Hollywood, with orchestra arranged and conducted by Ralph Carmichael. The recording was released on the Capitol album I Believe the following year.Popoff, M. (2009). Goldmine Record Album Price Guide.

This version was included on the Polydor album 20 Memories in Gold, an album largely consisting of re- recordings of his earlier hits, which was released in September that year. In May 1980, Laine recorded "I Believe" at a session of his hit re-recordings used by K-Tel. The recordings were backed by an orchestra conducted by Don Jackson with The Worlettes, and released on the 1982 album The Music Of Frankie Laine.

2088809	I Am Not a Doctor	I Am Not a Doctor is the second album by the English/Irish electronic dance music duo Moloko, released in 1998. The album received critical praise, although it was not a big seller. I Am Not a Doctor was issued in the UK by Echo Records. The songs on the album built upon the electronic pop of Moloko's first album, Do You Like My Tight Sweater?, with further experimentation in drum and bass and synthpop. Included on I Am Not a Doctor is "Sing It Back", a track which entered the UK Singles Chart twice, becoming a top ten single in 1999 after being remixed by Boris Dlugosch and experiencing massive success in nightclubs. Although "Sing It Back" was released in the US by Warner Bros. Records and reached number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart, the album was not released there after the failure of "Day for Night (Blakdoktor Afterglow Mix)" as a single. ==Singles== # "The Flipside" (#53 UK) # "Sing It Back" (#4 UK, #1 US Dance) # "Knee Deepen" (promo) ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart (1998) Peak position Australian Albums (ARIA) 137 ==References== Category:Moloko albums Category:1998 albums
21107874	I Am Omega	I Am Omega, stylized as I Am Ωmega, is a 2007 American direct-to-DVD post- apocalyptic science fiction thriller film produced by The Asylum and starring Mark Dacascos. The film is an unofficial and uncredited adaptation of the 1954 novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson, the title being a reference to the 1971 film adaptation The Omega Man. The movie was intentionally released as a "mockbuster" to capitalize on the release of the theatrical film I Am Legend of the same year.I Am Legend by Todd McCarthy, Variety, Dec. 7, 2007. ==Plot== The film takes place in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, which is overrun by zombie-like, cannibalistic humans who have degenerated into a feral subspecies as the result of a genetic infection. The film does not make clear if the virus has infected the entire world, or just a small, isolated area, but it is suggested that it is global by the inability of the hero, Renchard (Mark Dacascos), to locate radio signals or contact anyone via the Internet. Renchard has been forced to live in a daily struggle for survival against the mutants. One day, Renchard is contacted via webcam by Brianna (Jennifer Lee Wiggins), another survivor who was stranded in L.A. while trying to find Antioch, a community of survivors. She asks Renchard to help her, but Renchard, who has placed time bombs at strategic points around the city, refuses. Two men (the film's screenwriter Geoff Meed and Ryan Lloyd) claiming to be from Antioch arrive at his home seeking his aid. Although initially unpersuaded by their argument that Brianna carries the cure to the virus in her blood, Renchard is forced to cooperate under gunpoint. With 24 hours before the bombs are set to detonate, he leads the men into the city. They must find and free Brianna before the mutants or the bombs can destroy them. After Renchard and Brianna flee the city and Mike (Ryan Lloyd) is killed in the sewers, Vincent (Geoff Meed) shoots Renchard and captures Brianna. He tells Renchard he did it because he liked the world the way it was and leaves him to die. After Renchard recovers his strength, he hotwires a car and chases after Vincent to save Brianna. After finding them, Renchard kills Vincent, who was attempting to rape and kill Brianna. The bombs explode, and they both head to Antioch to make a cure. However, it is revealed that a single zombie has survived the explosion. ==Critical response== This low-budget, direct-to-video film was hurried into production and released a month prior to the big budget Will Smith film I Am Legend in an attempt to cash in on the similar-sounding titles and plots.Movie 'Mockbusters' Put Snakes on Trains, Weekend Edition Saturday, National Public Radio, December 8, 2007."And if You Can't Catch 'Cloverfield'..." by Grady Hendrix, The New York Sun, January 18, 2008. This has led to some confusion among film fans, which is no doubt the intention of film distributor The Asylum, which have used this marketing strategy in the past with such other confusingly-titled films as 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Transmorphers, The Da Vinci Treasure and Snakes on a Train. Critics had few good things to say about the film. Matt Bradshaw said, "The film starts off with a modest amount of promise, but when the story veers away from the film it's aping things quickly go down hill.""Killer B's on DVD: I Am Omega" by Matt Bradshaw, Cinematical, Dec. 17, 2007. The San Diego Union Tribune said satirically that the film is "The long-awaited prequel to Animal House, in which Bluto's secret pact with that reviled rival frat is finally revealed?""A VIRAL IDEA: Legions of Legends" by James Hebert, The San Diego Union Tribune, December 14, 2007, accessed Jan. 16, 2009. Film Critics United said that "As far as flicks from The Asylum go, I Am Omega is their best one yet, at least of the ones I've seen. Admittedly this includes fare such as Snakes on a Train, Transmorphers and Super Croc, all surely among the worst films ever made, but for a little while at least I Am Omega was more than just a 'good flick for Asylum standards' but just a plain old decent flick. For a little while at least." ==Cast== * Mark Dacascos as Renchard * Geoff Meed as Vincent * Jennifer Lee Wiggins as Brianna * Ryan Lloyd as Mike *Gregory Paul Smith as Various Zombies ==See also== * The Last Man on Earth starring Vincent Price * World War Z by Max Brooks ==References== ==External links== * I Am Omega at The Asylum * Category:2007 direct-to-video films Category:2007 independent films Category:2007 films Category:2000s science fiction thriller films Category:American independent films Category:American science fiction thriller films Category:The Asylum films Category:Mockbuster films Category:Films about viral outbreaks Category:Films based on works by Richard Matheson Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:American post-apocalyptic films Category:American zombie films Category:Unofficial film adaptations Category:Direct-to-video science fiction films Category:Films directed by Griff Furst Category:Films based on American horror novels Category:Films based on science fiction novels Category:Films about cannibalism Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s American films

21254702	I Can Do Bad All by Myself (film)	I Can Do Bad All by Myself is a 2009 American romantic musical comedy-drama film which was released on September 11, 2009. The film was directed, produced, and written by Tyler Perry, who also makes an appearance in the film as his signature character Madea. The rest of the cast consists of Taraji P. Henson, Adam Rodriguez, Brian White, Mary J. Blige, Gladys Knight, and Marvin L. Winans. Although the film and play share the same title, the film is not an adaptation of Perry's play of the same name; the two works have different storylines as this film tells the story of an alcoholic lounge singer who is persuaded to take the custody of her niece and nephews by Madea after she catches them breaking into her house and their grandmother has gone missing. Both are named for a lyric in the Changing Faces song "G.H.E.T.T.O.U.T.". It is the fifth film in the Madea franchise. Despite receiving generally mixed reviews from critics, I Can Do Bad All by Myself was a box office success, grossing $51.7 million worldwide against a $19 million budget. ==Plot== The film opens with April, a self-centered, alcoholic singer, performing at the nightclub Club Indigo where she works. On the other side of town, Madea and Joe Simmons catch Jennifer, Manny, and Byron breaking into their house. After hearing the children’s troubles, Madea welcomes and feeds them. Manny tells Madea that they're living with their grandmother Rose, whom they haven't seen in four days, and their mother is deceased. They tell her that their only other relative is their Aunt April. April shares her home with her abusive boyfriend Randy, who's married with children. The next morning, Madea brings the kids to April's house, but April doesn’t want to be bothered. Meanwhile, Pastor Brian sends a Colombian immigrant named Sandino to her house for work and a place to stay. April puts Sandino in her basement and wants to lock him down there because she doesn't know him that well. While working around the house, Sandino surprises April by cleaning himself up. When Randy arrives, he sees April with the kids and Sandino and heckles him while making not-so subtle advances at Jennifer. Shortly afterward, Pastor Brian and Wilma, a church member, come to inform April that her mother Rose died from a fatal brain aneurysm while riding on a city bus and was cremated. April is devastated by the news and seeks comfort from Randy. However, he is sleeping and shrugs her off. Later, Sandino comforts April as she tells him about her mother's death and the last time she spoke with her. Shortly afterward, Jennifer, Manny, and Byron return to April's after searching for their grandmother, and April dejectedly tells them the news. Depressed, Jennifer goes to Madea wanting to know how to pray. Inexperienced with prayer, Madea attempts to instruct her in a scene that plays out comically. Later that night, Tanya, Club Indigo's bartender, sings "I Can Do Bad". Before singing the song, Tanya strongly confronts April about her attitude. She says that April must change her selfish ways and think about the safety of Byron, Manny and Jennifer. Tanya declares she loves April, but says she can’t help her unless she helps herself. Over time, Sandino and April become good friends. Sandino fixes a ruined bedroom in her house. This makes Manny and Byron happy, but upsets Jennifer, who feels April does not want them there. While on a date, Sandino tells April he doesn't understand why she is with Randy and asks if she loves Randy. He tells her what true love is to him. One Sunday morning, Sandino eagerly knocks on April's bedroom door to get April ready for church, but Randy threatens to kill Sandino if he continues to spend time with April. The next night, Manny needs his insulin shot and Jennifer goes to the kitchen to get it. As she prepares the shot, Randy approaches and attempts to rape her, but Sandino fights him off. April walks in on the fight, and Randy claims Jennifer offered him sex for money. April pretends to believe him and sends Randy to take a bath. When he is in the tub, April threatens to electrocute him with a plugged-in radio. Sandino arrives and tries to stop her, but April is enraged, as she explains that she was sexually abused by her stepfather Lee, who then lied about it to her mother, thus causing April to lose her faith in the people that cared about her. Once this is revealed, it is then known why April became an alcoholic due to her stepfather lying to her mother for years over the sexual abuse and why April chose to live a life without children and resenting her stepfather for what he did to her. Afterward, she drops the radio into the water, giving Randy a severe electric shock. Randy barely jumps out just in time, and Sandino orders him to leave in three minutes. April goes to Club Indigo for a drink and blames herself for not seeing the signs, just like her mother didn't see the signs with her. Sandino tries to stop her from drinking while mentioning that Randy has moved out, but she pushes him away. She then asks Sandino if he is a child molester because of all the attention he gives the children. Sandino tells April of his childhood as a child laborer and explains that he loves the children so much because he sees himself in them. Feeling hurt at her unfair accusations, Sandino says farewell to the children and leaves. Jennifer and April begin to get along and connect after April tells Jennifer about her bad experience as a child. Jennifer tells her that she should recognize Sandino as a good man. Eventually, Sandino returns and April apologizes to him and admits that she loves him like a friend. Sandino tells her that she can't love anyone until she learns to love herself. He tells April that he is in love with her, but he wants April to love him back the same way he loves her. He shows her by kissing her. Eventually, April and Sandino get married. April and Sandino then hold a block party for their reception with Tanya singing "Good Woman Down", dedicated to April, then the new couple is shown embracing and sharing a passionate kiss. ==Cast== * Taraji P.

Rotten Tomatoes gave it a approval rating based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site's consensus states: "Though somewhat formulaic and predictable, Perry succeeds in mixing broad humor with sincere sentimentality to palatable effect." Metacritic reported that the film has a score of 55 out of 100 based on 13 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale. Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the movie an "A−" grade, saying, "After a summer of phony, pasty rom-coms, do this: See a movie where old- fashioned notions of love, faith, strength, and the possibility of redemption are taken seriously." Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called the film "overlong but well-shaped and involving", praising Perry for finding a balanced mix of "earnest soap opera moralism with [his] comic instincts", calling it his "most confident and competent mixture of uplifting black middle-class melodrama and low-down comedy." Cliff Doerksen of the Chicago Reader said about the film: "Contrived, sentimental, tonally bipolar, and as predictable as clockwork, this latest from chitlin' circuit impresario Tyler Perry is just a fat slab of ecstatic entertainment." Rob Humanick of Slant Magazine felt the film was a great gateway for people not familiar with the "scabrous antics and homegrown moralizing" delivered by the Madea character, saying that Perry lends his creation a more "greater level[s] of tonal consistency" than his previously contradictory Madea Goes to Jail, writing that "I Can Do Bad acknowledges Madea's flaws with loving scrutiny, and doesn't require approval of her more selfish attributes." Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic was critical of Perry's filmmaking for delivering lengthy musical numbers and overlooked story elements but gave praise to the performances of Henson and Wilson for showcasing his ability to "create meaty roles for women." The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave the film a "B−" grade, praising Henson's performance and the "riveting musical numbers" by Knight and Blige for emitting more "feverish emotions" to the film than Perry's "characteristically ham-fisted screenplay", concluding that "His oeuvre has always been shameless and over the top, but Bad might just be the first of Perry’s films to border on operatic." Kimberley Jones of The Austin Chronicle criticized Perry for prolonging the film's conclusion but gave him credit for bringing "increasingly mature moviemaking" to his production, highlighting the Madea scenes as being "pretty damn funny" and the performances of Wilson and Henson for being "nuanced and quite moving" and having a "likable screen presence" respectively. ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * * Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad All by Myself at MovieSet Category:2009 films Category:2009 comedy films Category:2009 drama films Category:2009 romantic comedy-drama films Category:2000s American films Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s musical comedy-drama films Category:2000s romantic musical films Category:African-American musical films Category:African-American romantic comedy-drama films Category:American films based on plays Category:American romantic comedy-drama films Category:American romantic musical films Category:Films about interracial romance Category:Films directed by Tyler Perry Category:Films scored by Aaron Zigman Category:Films shot in Atlanta Category:Films with screenplays by Tyler Perry Category:Lionsgate films
21296846	I Am a Hotel	I Am a Hotel is a 1983 Canadian made for TV short musical film, written by Leonard Cohen and Mark Shekter and directed by Allan F. Nicholls. The storyline is based on imaginary events in the King Edward Hotel in Toronto, and the guests' (usually romantic) interactions with each other. ==Production== Leonard Cohen had the idea for the film based upon his personal experiences and his song "The Guests". It was originally intended for the Canadian pay TV network C-Channel, but when the network collapsed, the production was completed by Citytv with financial assistance from Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and the Canadian Film Development Corporation. ===Scenes=== Cohen features frequently, as an amused bystander ('the Resident'). Extensive dance routines in scenes 2 and 3 were choreographed by Ann(e) Ditchburn, who also dances as the Gypsy wife in scene 3. There are five scenes, each based on a Cohen song. #"The Guests" in which the characters enter via the lobby and are taken to their rooms; The bellboy and chambermaid meet in the corridor; and the manager and his wife apparently have angry words in the lobby after which she strides off. #"Memories" (in which the bellboy pursues the chambermaid around the laundry and ballroom) #"The Gypsy Wife" (in which the manager's wife, in fetching attire, dances on the boardroom table) #"Chelsea Hotel #2" (in which the two lovers try, and fail, to make love, and the admiral and diva at last face each other across the hallway) #"Suzanne" (in which scenes of Suzanne with Cohen are interspersed with shots of the two couples reunited and dancing together, and the hotel manager distraught and then drinking at the bar) A short epilogue repeats the opening material from 'The Guests'. The final credits give the makers as 'Blue Memorial Video Ltd' and dedicate the piece to David Blue (1941-1982). ==Cast== *Leonard Cohen as The Resident *Celia Franca as The Diva *Alberta Watson as Suzanne *Toller Cranston as The Manager *Claudia Moore as Chambermaid *Daniel Allman as Young Lover *Samantha Logan as Young Lover *Robert Desrosiers as The Bellboy *Anne Ditchburn as The Gypsy Wife *Leo Leyden as The Admiral ==Release== The film was released on video in 1996. ==Recognition== The film won a Golden Rose international television award at the 1984 Montreux TV festival in Montreux, Switzerland. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== *I Am a Hotel at the Internet Movie Database *I Am a Hotel at the Leonard Cohen files Category:1983 films Category:Films shot in Toronto Category:Films set in Toronto Category:Canadian drama short films Category:Leonard Cohen Category:1980s musical films Category:Canadian musical films Category:1980s English-language films Category:1980s Canadian films

I Corps () was a corps of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), the army of the nation state of South Vietnam that existed from 1955 to 1975. It was one of four corps of the ARVN. This was the northernmost region of South Vietnam, bordering North Vietnam at the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). These five provinces are Quảng Trị Province, (Khe Sanh, Đông Hà, Quảng Trị City), Thừa Thiên-Huế Province, (Phu Bai, Huế City), Quảng Nam Province, (Đà Nẵng, Hội An), Quảng Tín Province, (Tam Kỳ, Chu Lai) and Quảng Ngãi Province, (Quảng Ngãi). I Corps became operational in November 1957. Among its formations and units were the ARVN 1st Division. The I CTZ, later Military Region 1, was partnered with the U.S. III Marine Expeditionary Force and the XXIV Corps. ==Lam Son 719== General Hoàng Xuân Lãm was given responsibility for the I Corps Tactical Zone in 1967. He coordinated the South Vietnamese Operation Lam Sơn 719 offensive which aimed at striking the North Vietnamese logistical corridor known as the Ho Chi Minh trail in southeastern Laos during 1971. Due to his political connections with President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, he was still serving as I Corps commander when the North Vietnamese launched the Easter Offensive in 1972. Lãm was recalled to Saigon on 2 May 1972 by Thiệu, who relieved him of his command, due to complaints regarding Lãm's fitness and competency as a general. He was succeeded as commander by Ngô Quang Trưởng former commander of the 1st Division and IV Corps. The 20th Tank Regiment, the first tank regiment in the ARVN, was formed at Quảng Trị in 1971 equipped with the M48 Patton.Simon Dunstan, Vietnam Tracks: Armor into Battle 1945–75, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London, 1982, 59. ==1975 Spring Offensive== Military Region 1's forces disintegrated during the 1975 Spring Offensive (the Hue–Da Nang Campaign). The situation for the South Vietnamese in Military Region 1 had regained some stability after the defeat of a three-division PAVN push during late 1974. By early the following year, Military Region 1 fielded three infantry divisions (the 1st, 2nd and 3rd), the elite Airborne and Marine Divisions, four Ranger Groups and the 1st Armored Brigade (established in 1969 to parent all the armored cavalry regiments in the MR). Until mid-March, the North Vietnamese had limited their offensive operations to attempts to cut Highway 1, the main north/south line of communication, between Huế and Da Nang and between Da Nang and Chu Lai. To confront the South Vietnamese, PAVN Brigadier General Lê Trọng Tấn had amassed a force of the crack 2nd, 304th, 324B, 325C and 711th Divisions and nine independent infantry regiments, three sapper regiments, three armored regiments, twelve anti-aircraft and eight artillery regiments. thumb|right|200px|Initial phase of PAVN offensive in I Corps At a meeting in Saigon on 13 March President Thiệu was briefed on the military situation by Trưởng and another corps commander. Thiệu then laid out his plan for national consolidation. As Trưởng understood it, he was free to redeploy his forces to hold the Da Nang area.South Vietnam's second largest city was to be held due to possible future exploitation of offshore oil deposits. Dougan and Fulghum, p. 68. Trưởng was shocked to discover, however, that the Airborne Division was to be removed to III Corps (unknown to Trưởng at the time, the Marine Division was also already earmarked for redeployment with both units then forming a new national reserve). General Trưởng was recalled to Saigon on 19 March to brief Thiệu on his withdrawal plan. The general had developed two contingency plans: The first was predicated on government control of Highway 1, which would be utilized for two simultaneous withdrawals from Huế and Chu Lai to Da Nang; The second course presupposed PAVN interdiction of the highway and called for a withdrawal into three enclaves: Huế, Da Nang, and Chu Lai. This was to be only an interim measure, however, since the forces that withdrew to Huế and Chu Lai would then be sea-lifted to Da Nang by the navy. The president then stunned the general by announcing that he had misinterpreted his previous orders:Dougan and Fulghum, pp. 68–69. The old imperial capital of Huế was not to be abandoned. Making matters worse, Trưởng discovered that his force was to be reduced by the removal of the Airborne Division. ==Divisions== File:ARVN 1st Division SSI.svg|1st Infantry Division File:ARVN 2nd Division SSI.svg|2nd Infantry Division File:ARVN 3rd Infantry Division SSI.svg|3rd Infantry Division ==Notes== == References == *Dougan, Clark, David Fulghum, et al.

22227583	I Could Never Miss You (More Than I Do)	"I Could Never Miss You (More Than I Do)" was the fourth and final US Top 40 hit for Lulu. ==History== "I Could Never Miss You (More Than I Do)" was introduced on Lulu's 1978 album Don't Take Love For Granted, a Rocket Records release co-produced by Mark London the co-writer of Lulu's signature song "To Sir, With Love" and also the husband of Lulu's longtime manager Marion Massey. The album's other co-producer was Lem Lubin onetime bassist with Unit 4 + 2 and Christie and from 1977 a&r; head for Rocket Records. Session Personnel for I Could Never Miss You (More Than I Do) by Lulu DrumsTrevor Spencer 1 BassAlan Tarney KeyboardsLynton Naiff 1 GuitarsRay Russell PercussionRay Cooper ChoraleJoanne Stone, Stevie Lange, Vicki Brown String arrangementLynton Naiff Orchestra LeaderGavyn Wright According to Lulu, Mark London had discovered Neil Harrison and asked Lulu to record demos of Harrison's compositions to pitch to another singer: (quote Lulu:) "as soon as we did the demos it was very obvious that they weren't going to be demos. They were obviously going to be for me."The Palm Beach Post 27 November 1981 p. 28 A total of four Harrison compositions would appear on the Don't Take Love For Granted including the title cut and "Love is the Sweetest Mistake" which were respectively the A-side and B-side of the overlooked lead single. In 1981 Alfa Records acquired Lulu's Rocket Records recordings and released "I Could Never Miss You" as a single backed with "Dance to the Feeling in Your Heart" - the latter track had been a non-album B-side being the flip of "I Love to Boogie" the second single off the UK edition of the Don't Take Love For Granted album. "I Could Never Miss You" was issued in July 1981 in the US where Lulu's US profile had received a recent boost via her participation in two ATV series devoted to rock and roll music: Oh Boy aired in the autumn of 1980 while Let's Rock ran over the summer of 1981. Also the early 1980s saw a considerable boost in the popularity of easy listening music as exemplified by the success of the comparable Sheena Easton. The 1981 success of "I Could Never Miss You" resulted in Alfa issuing a self-titled album by Lulu featuring "I Could Never Miss You" plus two other tracks from the Don't Take Love For Granted album: the title cut plus "You Are Still a Part of Me", with seven newly recorded tracks completing the album. ==Chart performance== "I Could Never Miss You" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1981, rising to a #18 peak in October. This marked Lulu's first appearance in the US Top 20 since "To Sir, with Love" in 1967. "I Could Never Miss You" - whose Cash Box peak was #14 \- also reached #2 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. The US success of "I Could Never Miss You" translated into only a glimmer of interest in Lulu's native UK, where the single - issued October 1981 - peaked at #62 in the final week of 1981 – it would mark Lulu's sole UK charting between "Take Your Mama For a Ride" in 1975 and "Shout" in 1986. "I Could Never Miss You" also charted low in Australia at #71, although this was somewhat offset by a 16-week run. Canada's RPM magazine ranked "I Could Never Miss You" with a #10 peak. The track had its strongest chart impact in New Zealand with an April 1982 peak of #3, which remains the highest post-1960s' peak on a national Pop chart for a solo recording by Lulu (tying with the 1974 UK chart peak of "The Man Who Sold the World"). ==Other versions== * Melba Moore as "I Could Never Miss You More" for her 1980 album Closer * Bobbi Walker as "I Could Never Miss You" for her 1980 album Diamond in the Rough * Shirley Bassey as "Nadie Más Te Quiso (Como Yo)" (Nobody loves you more [than me]) for her 1989 Spanish language album La Mujer whose producer Leonardo Schultz wrote the new lyrics. * Syd Dale as an instrumental on his album Love Isn't Just For The Young ==References== Category:Lulu (singer) songs Category:1981 singles Category:1978 songs Category:Songs about heartache

22280680	I Corps (British India)	The I Indian Corps was an army corps of the British Indian Army in the World War I. It was formed at the outbreak of war under the title Indian Corps from troops sent to the Western Front. The British Indian Army did not have a pre- war corps structure, and it held this title until further corps were created. It was withdrawn from the Western Front in December 1915 and reconstituted as I Indian Corps in Mesopotamia until the end of the war. ==Western Front== thumb|A group of soldiers from the Indian Corps who had been mentioned in dispatches during fighting on the Western Front In 1914 Indian Expeditionary Force A was sent to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) fighting in France. In France it formed the Indian Cavalry Corps and Indian Corps composed of 3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) Divisions. (In France, these formations were simply known as 'Lahore' and 'Meerut' Divisions, to distinguish them from the 3rd and 7th British divisions.) Despatch from India was delayed by the activities of the German raiders and operating in the Indian Ocean, and by the slow speed of the transport vessels. Lahore Division began landing at Marseilles on 26 September 1914, but there were further delays while the troops were re-armed with the latest pattern rifle, and the supply train could be improvised, using tradesmens' vans procured locally.Edmonds, 1914, Vol II, p. 92, Note 1. The corps finally got into action at the Battles of La Bassée, 1st Messines and Armentières in October–November 1914. ===Order of Battle October–December 1914=== General Officer Commanding: Lieut-Gen Sir J.

Coincidentally, on the same day, the Secretary of State for India, Austen Chamberlain, told the Viceroy of India that he was anxious for the Indian infantry to be withdrawn from France before they had to endure another winter. The system for supplying drafts had broken down and the Indian battalions were becoming very weak after the heavy casualties they had suffered. Although the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, objected to their withdrawal from the Western Front, orders were issued on 31 October for the two divisions of Indian Corps (3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) Division) to embark at Marseilles for Mesopotamia.Edmonds & Wynne, 1915, Vol II, pp. 402–3. Indian Corps was relieved in the front line on 6 November by XI Corps and the two divisions were due at Basra in December, but their departure from Marseilles was delayed because of fear of submarine attack.Moberly, Vol II. 3rd (Lahore) Division finally arrived in Mesopotamia in April 1916 and joined Tigris Corps, too late to relieve 6th (Poona) Division at Kut-al-Amara. == See also == * Mewar Bhil Corps ==Notes== ==References== * * * ==External links and further reading== * India and the Western Front, Dr David Omissi, BBC History website * * Category:Corps of British India Category:Corps of India in World War I Category:Military units and formations established in 1914 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1918

In late 2005, they started recording I Believe in a studio in Wellington New Zealand. Midway during the production of the album, a limited edition EP was released at the 2006 Parachute Music Festival.

2254705	I Call Your Name	"I Call Your Name" is a song recorded by the English rock band the Beatles and credited to Lennon–McCartney. It was written primarily by John Lennon, with assistance from Paul McCartney. It was released in the US on The Beatles' Second Album on 10 April 1964 and in the UK on the Long Tall Sally EP on 19 June 1964. On 7 March 1988, the song appeared on Past Masters, a compilation album that includes every song commercially released by the band that was neither included on the 12 UK studio albums nor the US Magical Mystery Tour LP, meaning that "I Call Your Name" appeared for the first time on a core catalogue album. ==Overview== Lennon wrote the song prior to the formation of the Beatles. In 1963, he gave it to Billy J. Kramer of The Dakotas, another Liverpool band who were signed to Parlophone by George Martin. Kramer released it as the B-side of the single "Bad to Me", another Lennon–McCartney composition. Lennon was reportedly dissatisfied with the Dakotas' arrangement of his song as well as its position as the single's B-side, so the Beatles recorded their own version. The song features George Harrison playing the Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, offering the distinctive sound of the famous guitar to the world for the first time. Since the song was being considered for inclusion in the Beatles' 1964 debut film A Hard Day's Night, a rush mono mix for United Artists was attempted on 3 March 1964, but was ultimately scrapped. The following day, a new mono mix was made for the US Capitol Records release The Beatles' Second Album, while a stereo mix, edited from two separate takes, was recorded on 10 March 1964 and was also rushed to the US for the stereo version of the album. The edit uses an alternate take of the opening guitar riff and the opening line sung by Lennon. The final UK mono mix was performed on 4 June 1964, intended for the A Hard Day's Night LP, but ultimately appearing on the EP Long Tall Sally. The final UK stereo mix, performed on 22 June 1964, three days after the release of the Long Tall Sally EP, and also intended for the upcoming stereo version of the UK album, did not appear on a British release until the 1976 Rock 'n' Roll Music compilation (along with the remaining tracks from the Long Tall Sally EP). The song was never added to the 1964 film A Hard Day's Night because director Richard Lester thought it sounded too similar to "You Can't Do That", which was recorded five days prior and featured on the non-soundtrack side of the album release. The mono mixes feature cowbell from the start of the rhythm downbeat. The UK stereo edit has no cowbell and Lennon's vocal is single tracked until edited at the second measure of the opening verse, when the cowbell and double tracked vocal appear. The earlier US stereo mix places the edit on the word "call", and the double tracking and cowbell begin. The vocals are more prominent to the right, with the UK version being better centered, and there is a significant addition of reverb by the producers of The Beatles' Second Album. The song's instrumental bridge is the Beatles' first attempt at ska. "I Call Your Name" was re-released in stereo in 1988 on the compilation album Past Masters.

22598521	I Am a Lonesome Hobo	"I Am a Lonesome Hobo" is a song written and recorded by Bob Dylan, released in 1967 on his eighth studio album, John Wesley Harding. The song was produced by Bob Johnston. ==Background and composition== In their book Bob Dylan All the Songs: The Story Behind Every Track, authors Philippe Margotin and Jean- Michel Guesdon observe that the hobo, "a vagabond or tramp, traveling by train throughout America and offering his services to farms to earn enough money to survive", was a "key figure in early 20th century American society", including in the works of Dylan's influences Woody Guthrie and Jack Kerouac. They point out how Dylan's song is narrated by such a character and that Dylan draws a parallel between this narrator and Cain (who killed his brother Abel) in the Book of Genesis. They also note that, musically, it is the "most blues-rock song on the album" even if Dylan is only playing an acoustic guitar. The version that appeared on the album is the fifth and final take. ==Critical reception== The original Rolling Stone review of John Wesley Harding from 1968 claimed that the song recalled Arthur Rimbaud's "miniature masterpiece My Bohemian Existence" and noted how Dylan "brilliantly...reverses the role of the Hobo and tells us what road one may end up on if one does not 'stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code', hold your judgment for yourself and keep cool". Dylan scholar Tony Attwood sees the song as "fitting neatly alongside 'Drifter's Escape', representing the other side of the coin of the outcast in American society". Whereas the narrator of "Drifter's Escape" is an honest man who "steals only in desperation", the narrator of "I Am a Lonesome Hobo" is a man whose "past success and well-being financially...has corrupted him". Jochen Markhorst calls it a song of "simple beauty" but also "a neglected child" since Dylan never played the song again after recording it for John Wesley Harding. Markhorst also notes that, "To compensate: almost every cover is very attractive". In a 2021 essay, Greil Marcus mentions the song as an exemplary blues from Dylan, citing it as his first example of Dylan's version of "the chair" (after a metaphor John Lennon had used in a Rolling Stone interview: "[The blues] is not a concept. It is a chair, not a design for a chair...it's chairs for sitting on, not chairs for looking at or being appreciated. You sit on that music."). Marcus also notes the song has origins in "Poor Boy, Long Way from Home and a hundred other blues and folk songs". ==Notable covers== There have been at least a half dozen notable covers of "I am a Lonesome Hobo". * Brian Auger Trinity and Julie Driscoll released a cover as a single in 1968 * Thea Gilmore for her tribute project John Wesley Harding in 2011 * Duke Robillard on his album Ear Worms in 2019 * The Triffids on their debut album Treeless Plain in 1983 * Jazz musician Jef Lee Johnson on his 2009 album The Zimmerman Shadow * Mikael Wiehe who translated it into Swedish (as "Jag är en fattig stackare") for the 2006 Dylan by Totta & Wiehe tribute album ==References== ==External links== *Lyrics at Bob Dylan's official site Category:Bob Dylan songs Category:1967 songs Category:Songs written by Bob Dylan Category:Song recordings produced by Bob Johnston

It was written by Derek Bramble and Franne Golde, produced by Narada Michael Walden, and was released on October 18, 1991, as the album's fifth single. "I Belong to You" was a Top 10 hit on the US Billboard R&B; chart, and also charted in the UK and the Netherlands. The song garnered Houston a nomination for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance at the 35th Grammy Awards (1993). ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that Houston "delivers a mature and restrained vocal within a lush, urban-angled swing/R&B; arrangement." He noted its "contagious chorus". A reviewer from Music & Media said that "the hip hop-shaped beat is more raw than the melody line, reminiscent of Beats International's 'Dub Be Good to Me'. Vintage Houston." Alan Jones from Music Week viewed it as "a pleasant but unexceptional soul shuffle". James Hunter of Rolling Stone commented that the song "acts out its claim in a penthouse bedroom", and described its production by Narada Michael Walden as "high-end grooves accented by pinballing counterrhythms." ==Music video== The music video for "I Belong to You" features some shots from "My Name Is Not Susan", that are extended and/or unreleased in the video to that song. Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was featured in the video and was also featured in "My Name is Not Susan" as well.

22811714	I Accuse!	I Accuse! is a British 1958 CinemaScope biographical drama film directed by and starring José Ferrer. The film is based on the true story of the Dreyfus affair, in which a Jewish captain in the French Army was falsely accused of treason. ==Plot synopsis== In 1894 Alfred Dreyfus (José Ferrer), a Jewish captain in the French Army, is falsely accused of treason. He is sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil's Island. Major Ferdinand Walsin-Esterhazy, an infantry officer of Hungarian descent, helps in the investigation. When he is found to be the real spy, the French Army tries to hide the truth by exonerating the traitor in a mock trial. Émile Zola, the famous French author, writes an open letter to the prime minister of France entitled I Accuse!, which reveals the truth behind the cover up. The letter is published in the newspaper, causing a firestorm around the world, leading to a re-examination of the entire Dreyfus case. Eventually, Esterhazy makes a full confession, and Dreyfus is completely exonerated, being inducted into the French Legion of Honor. ==Cast== * José Ferrer as Captain Alfred Dreyfus * Anton Walbrook as Major Esterhazy * Viveca Lindfors as Lucie Dreyfus * Leo Genn as Major Piquart * Emlyn Williams as Émile Zola * David Farrar as Mathieu Dreyfus * Donald Wolfit as General Mercier * Herbert Lom as Major DuPaty de Clam * Harry Andrews as Major Henry * Felix Aylmer as Edgar Demange * George Coulouris as Colonel Sandherr * Peter Illing as Georges Clemenceau * Michael Hordern as Prosecutor * Laurence Naismith as Judge * Ernest Clark as Prosecutor * Eric Pohlmann as Bertillon * John Phillips as Prosecutor, Esterhazy trial * Malcolm Keen as President of France * Charles Gray as Captain Brossard ==Production== The film was based on a book Captain Dreyfus: Story of Mass Hysteria which was published in 1955. In October 1955 MGM acquired an option on the film rights. The story had been filmed previously, notably in The Life of Émile Zola , but MGM claimed the book "contains quite a bit of material that had not come to life before". The film was known as Captain Dreyfus before being retitled I Accuse. The location work was done in Belgium, as the French army refused to allow filming in France. Filming finished by June 1957. I Accuse! was a box office flop. It earned $190,000 in the US and Canada and $475,000 elsewhere, leading to a loss of $1,415,000. ==Reception== Variety called the film "strong, if plodding, entertainment." The publication said Ferrer's performance is "a wily, impeccable one, but it comes from the intellect rather than the heart and rarely causes pity." The Philadelphia Inquirer was unimpressed: "For no immediately apparent reason, the Dreyfus scandal...is being given a new screen airing....more zeal than art....Gore Vidal's plodding writing is almost constantly at odds with the overly melodramatic or numbed performances director-star Ferrer has elicited from himself and his cast....If Ferrer underplays drastically, the reverse must be said for almost everyone else in the large, hard-pressed cast."Martin, Mildred. "Jose Ferrer Stars in 'I Accuse'." Philadelphia Inquirer, 6 March 1958. New York Times critic Bosley Crowther wrote that the film's "studious and generally valid re-enactment of the highlights of the case offers rewards," but said the film lacked excitement and drama and that "Mr. Ferrer's Dreyfus is a sad sack, a silent and colorless man who takes his unjust conviction with but one outburst of protest and then endures his Devil's Island torment lying down. He is a chilly hero who stirs mere intellectual sympathy." ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:1958 films Category:1950s historical drama films Category:1950s biographical drama films Category:British biographical drama films Category:British historical drama films Category:British black-and-white films Category:Films about the Dreyfus affair Category:Films based on non- fiction books Category:Films set in 1894 Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:CinemaScope films Category:Films directed by José Ferrer Category:Films with screenplays by Gore Vidal Category:Films scored by William Alwyn Category:Cultural depictions of Georges Clemenceau Category:Cultural depictions of Alfred Dreyfus Category:Cultural depictions of Émile Zola Category:1950s English-language films Category:1950s British films

It peaked at number thirty- eight on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Described as one of the album's "monumental singles",Huey, Steve. [ allmusic Eric B. & Rakim > Biography]. Allmusic. Accessed August 15, 2008. Michael Di Bella wrote in the All Music Guide to Rock that "Rakim grabs the listener by the throat and illustrates his mastery of the rhyming craft". A music video was made for it, featuring dancing from Flavor Flav of the group Public Enemy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TN-kDEKxF0 Music Video The song was selected by Jay-Z for the NBA 2K13 soundtrack. It was also featured in the video game Saints Row. ==Background== Eric B and Rakim met in 1985, after Rakim responded to Eric B's search for "New York's top MC". In 1986 they released their debut single, "Eric B. Is President", on an independent label Zakia Records. Def Jam Recordings co-founder Russell Simmons found out about the duo and they were signed to Island Records. In early 1987 the duo started working on Paid in Full. ==Recording== According to Rakim, the duo spent a week working on Paid in Full, with "I Ain't No Joke" taking most of it, four days. In an interview with Spin magazine Rakim said that while writing the song he deliberately avoided using obscene language: "I Ain't No Joke" was produced by the duo using the samples from "Pass the Peas" by The J.B.'s and "Theme from the Planets" by Dexter Wansel. Like most of the album, "I Ain't No Joke" was recorded at Power Play Studios in Long Island City, Queens, New York City. ==Music video== Music video for "I Ain't No Joke" was directed by Vivien Goldman, a British journalist, writer, and musician, who also had experience in guerrilla filmmaking. The budget available to them was low, so she asked Eric B. and Rakim where they like to hang out, and chose it as the locations for the music video. The video features Rakim rapping in three different locations: in front of a graffiti mural, on a playground with his friends, and outside of an electronics shop in Harlem, in front of a crowd, with Eric B. playing on turntables. The shots of these locations change constantly throughout the video. Both Eric B. and Rakim wear golden age era outfits, consisting of tracksuits and heavy gold chains and jewelry, and described by Complex magazine as "flamboyant" and "both classic and priceless". The video also features a cameo appearance from Flavor Flav of the group Public Enemy, and a cameo of "Chill Will", a DJ from the trio Doug E. Fresh and The Get Fresh Crew, dancing on the playground and in front of the crowd near the store. ==Track listing== ;Side A # "I Ain't No Joke" – 3:54 # "Extended Beat" – 3:49 ;Side B # "Eric B.

22964741	I Couldn't Live Without Your Love (album)	I Couldn't Live Without Your Love is a Petula Clark album released in the United States and the UK in September 1966. Clark's fifth US album release, I Couldn't Live Without Your Love was the first Petula Clark album to include creative personnel besides Tony Hatch, who produced the album and arranged some of the tracks, along with Johnny Harris. The album was released subsequent to the Top Ten success in both the UK and the US of the "I Couldn't Live Without Your Love" single. Unlike the parent albums of Clark's precedent hits which had favored original material over cover versions, the I Couldn't Live Without Your Love album featured seven contemporary covers plus the traditional pop standard "Come Rain or Come Shine". This formula proved to be a popularity booster in the UK where I Couldn't Live Without Your Love became Clark's first charting album; its #11 peak remains Clark's UK album chart best. In the US the album reached #43. The mid-60s hits Clark covers on the album include "Elusive Butterfly"; its original artist and writer Bob Lind has called Clark's recording his favourite version despite its omission of a verse. Also included is Clark's version of the Mindbenders' "A Groovy Kind of Love"; that track became a hit for Clark in Rhodesia (#7) and South Africa (#5) in the summer of 1967. The set opens with Clark's bouncy rendition of Frank Sinatra's recent #1 hit "Strangers in the Night". Her nasal version of the song was reportedly in retaliation for Sinatra's version of "Downtown". Clark performed the song on "The Hollywood Palace". The song "Two Rivers" was penned by Clark as autobiographic, with references to the Thames and the Seine Rivers, as well as to her husband. I Couldn't Live Without Your Love also features "Wasn't It You", which is Clark's only recording of a Gerry Goffin/Carole King song.1 *1Clark has cut post-1960s compositions written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King independently of each other - respectively "Two Lives" (Gerry Goffin/Tom Kelly/Billy Steinberg) and "Beautiful"; Clark has also recorded a live version of King's "You've Got a Friend". ==Track listing== ;Side one #"Strangers in the Night" (Bert Kaempfert, Charles Singleton, Eddie Snyder) #"A Groovy Kind of Love" (Carole Bayer Sager, Toni Wine) #"Rain" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) #"Wasn't It You" (Gerry Goffin, Carole King) #"There Goes My Love, There Goes My Life" (Tony Hatch, Petula Clark, Hubert Ballay, Jackie Trent) #"Monday Monday" (John Phillips) ;Side two #"Bang Bang" (Sonny Bono) #"Homeward Bound" (Paul Simon) #"Two Rivers" (Petula Clark) #"Come Rain or Come Shine" (Johnny Mercer, Harold Arlen) #"Elusive Butterfly" (Bob Lind) #"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love" (Tony Hatch, Jackie Trent) ==Personnel== ;Technical *Tony Hatch - arrangements, conductor *Johnny Harris - arrangements, conductor *Roy Prickett - recording engineer *Ed Thrasher - art direction ==References== Category:1966 albums Category:Pye Records albums Category:Petula Clark albums Category:Warner Records albums Category:Albums conducted by Johnny Harris (musician) Category:Albums arranged by Tony Hatch Category:Albums produced by Tony Hatch
2296541	I Could Go On Singing	I Could Go On Singing is a 1963 British-American musical drama film directed by Ronald Neame. It stars Judy Garland, Dirk Bogarde, and Jack Klugman. Originally titled The Lonely Stage, the film was renamed so that audiences would know that Garland sings in it; she had not sung in a film since A Star Is Born in 1954. Although not a huge box-office success on release, the film won Garland much praise for her performance. The film had its world premiere at the Plaza Theatre in London's West End on 6 March 1963.The Times, 6 March 1963, Page 2 This was Garland's final film before her death in 1969. In his memoir, Bogarde claimed that he had substantially rewritten Garland's lines, with her consent.John Coldstream, Dirk Bogarde, Weidenfeld & Nicolson 2004, p. 287 ==Plot== Jenny Bowman (Judy Garland) is a successful concert singer who regularly tours the world. During a stay in London, she visits recently widowed David Donne (Dirk Bogarde), a prominent surgeon. More than a decade ago, the two had an affair that led to the birth of Matt, who is raised by David alone and has been told that he was adopted. Although Jenny and David agreed that Matt would never know the truth, David takes Jenny to Matt's boarding school in Canterbury so that she may meet him just once. Jenny and Matt hit it off and the three spend the whole day together. Jenny invites the two to her concert at the London Palladium, but David is unable to make it because of work in Rome. With David absent and under the impression that Matt is back at school, Jenny and Matt spend a few days together exploring London. Jenny's manager and assistant try to cover for Matt by calling his school, but word about his absence gets back to David in Rome, who is furious. When David returns to London, he and Jenny have a fight, during which Matt overhears that they are his birth parents. David implores Matt to remain in England and finish his schooling, while Jenny insists that Matt should accompany her on her world tour. Confused, Matt rejects Jenny's invitations and the two agree to see each other again sometime in the future. Jenny turns to a night of drinking on the town to cope with the heartbreak and ends up twisting her ankle. At a clinic, she demands that David come to treat her. When he arrives, she claims to be quitting singing as she is "stretched too thin and everyone wants a bite," but David insists that she cannot let herself down this way and tells her that he loves her. At her concert that night, Jenny sings marvelously to the crowd. David leaves midway through her first number. == Cast == * Judy Garland as Jenny Bowman * Dirk Bogarde as David Donne * Jack Klugman as George Kogan, Miss Bowman's manager * Gregory Phillips as Matt * Aline MacMahon as Ida, Miss Bowman's dresser * Pauline Jameson as Miss Plimpton, Donne's nurse/receptionist * Jeremy Burnham as Hospital surgeon * Lorna Luft as Girl on boat (uncredited) * Joseph Luft as Boy on boat (uncredited) * Leon Cortez as Busker * Robert Rietty as Manager, London Palladium * Gerald Sim as Joe, Assistant Manager, London Palladium * Frazer Hines as a Schoolboy * Tony Robinson as a Schoolboy (uncredited) == Music == All songs performed by Judy Garland: * "I Am the Monarch of the Sea" (Judy Garland and Boys) from H.M.S. Pinafore by Gilbert and Sullivan * "Hello Bluebird", words and music by Cliff Friend * "'It Never Was You" by Kurt Weill and Maxwell Anderson * "By Myself" by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz * "I Could Go On Singing" by Harold Arlen and E. Y. Harburg == Reception == In the New York Herald Tribune, Judith Crist wrote, "Either you are or you aren't - a Judy Garland fan that is. And if you aren't, forget about her new movie, I Could Go On Singing, and leave the discussion to us devotees. You'll see her in close-up...in beautiful, glowing Technicolor and striking staging in a vibrant, vital performance that gets to the essence of her mystique as a superb entertainer. Miss Garland is - as always - real, the voice throbbing, the eyes aglow, the delicate features yielding to the demands of the years - the legs still long and lovely. Certainly the role of a top-rank singer beset by the loneliness and emotional hungers of her personal life is not an alien one to her...", Writing in the New York Daily News, Dorothy Masters said, "3 stars...Judy Garland is back on screen in a role that might have been custom- tailored for her particular talents. A new song, I Could Go On Singing, provides her with a little clowning, a chance to be gay, a time for wistfulness, an occasion for tears. She and Dirk Bogarde play wonderfully well together, even though the script itself insists on their being mismatched..." ==Soundtrack== A soundtrack album was released by Capitol Records at the time of the original film release. ==Novelization== A paperback novelization of the screenplay (uncredited in the book's authorship) was written by celebrated mystery novelist John D.

23240617	I Am Terrified	I Am Terrified is an American post-hardcore band originating from Birmingham, Alabama. The band was signed to Gotee Records and toured to promote their self-titled debut EP, I Am Terrified. ==History== The band was formed as Fixed Til Tuesday in Birmingham by guitarist Jeremy Folse, vocalist Patrick Schefano, and drummer Joel Bailey by knowing each other from local schools and churches. Influenced both by the sound of church hymns and hardcore rock, the three formed the band and released an independent EP, Aww Son. After much consideration and new thinking, Fixed Til Tuesday changed their name to I Am Terrified sometime between 2006 and 2010. The name comes straight from the verse in the Bible's Book of Job 23:14-15 which reads, "He carries out His decree against me, and many such plans He still has in store. That is why I am terrified before Him; when I think of all this, I fear Him."Database (undated). "Job 23:14-15 (New International Version)". BibleGateway.com. Retrieved March 1, 2013. As guitarist Jeremy Folse explained they changed the name because they became driven "by the desire to give God straight-up worship, and to show the love of Christ to every kid we can possibly reach". The band was signed in 2007 to Mono Vs Stereo Records and began work on their debut EP. When Mono Vs Stereo was put on hiatus by its parent company Gotee Records, the band was transferred to Gotee's roster. I Am Terrified was released on July 18, 2008, and then re-released on July 29, 2008. ==Members == ;Current *Patrick "Paddy" Schefano - vocals *Brandon Henderson - guitar *Joel Bailey - drums *Gabe Rosser guitar *John Ball bass guitar ;Past members *Logan Freeman rhythm guitar *Matthew Stagner - bass guitar *Dustin Carter bass guitar *Jeremy Folse guitar *Devin Smith (First Servant, the band's name previous to Fixed Til Tuesday) bass guitar *Daniel Nelems (Fixed Til Tuesday) bass guitar *Eric Anderton bass guitar *Mark Lucas drums == Discography == *Aww Son (as "Fixed Til Tuesday", 2006) *I Am Terrified (EP, 2008) ==See also== * List of Mono Vs Stereo artists * List of Gotee Records artists * Music of Alabama == References == == External links == * I Am Terrified on Myspace * Category:2004 establishments in Alabama Category:2010 disestablishments in Alabama Category:American screamo musical groups Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Alabama Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2010 Category:Musical groups established in 2004 Category:Musical quartets Category:Gotee Records artists Category:Musical groups from Birmingham, Alabama

2333244	I Am David	I am David is a 1963 novel by Anne Holm. It tells the story of a young boy who, with the help of a prison guard, escapes from a concentration camp in an unnamed Eastern European country and journeys to Denmark. Along the way, he meets many people who teach him about life outside the concentration camp. The book, originally written in Danish, has been translated into several languages, including Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, and German (all 1963), Dutch (1964), English (1965), Afrikaans (1982), and French (1986), and Konkani (1987). In the United States, the book was first called North to Freedom and "On the road to America", but it is now also being published as I am David. It was made into a film in 2003. ==Plot== 12-year-old David has lived in a concentration camp for as long as he can remember. David was a strong, brave, and intelligent boy who had been ripped away from his mother and put into a dreadful camp. His only friend in the camp, Johannes, died. As is revealed in a flashback in Chapter 1. One of the commandants has been keeping an eye on David, making sure he is fed properly and taking his vitamins. This guard sets up the escape, gives him some soap, and leaves a sack outside the camp fence with bread, a bottle of water, and a compass in it. David must go south to Thessaloniki (Salonika) , find a boat to Italy, then travel north to a free country that has a king. David finds a truck headed for Salonika, and without realizing it, climbs on board. He eats some of the food inside and when the truck stops, he jumps out. He finds a boat labelled "Italy" and sneaks in. After hiding for a few days and getting quite drunk from drinking wine, he is found. Thankfully, the Italian sailor decides to help David escape by lowering him down the side of the ship with a lifebelt on. He floats to land and, after climbing a little way, promptly falls asleep. After having a bath, David finds a cave to spend the day in. Then he decides to go to the town nearby to learn about life outside of a prison camp. He is given, much to his surprise, a loaf of bread. He also finds a piece of newspaper that he uses to practice reading with. Later, after visiting the town every day for a while, David uses the excuse that he works for a circus to explain why he is a [polyglot] and why he is travelling. Then he overhears people talking about him. He flees the town and travels north. On his way, he helps people, and sometimes they give him money. Along his journey, David discovers the beauty of the world and slowly changes his behavior and how he interacts with people. He saves a girl named Maria from a fire in a shed where she was trapped. David spends some time in Maria's family's house, where he sees a globe and learns about different countries. However, his knowledge of suffering and death, as well as his enmity with their eldest son and his deepening, overtly exclusive relationship with Maria worries the parents. David overhears them talking about him and, after writing them a letter, leaves the house to travel north again. Sometime later he sees a personal advertisement in a newspaper placed by Maria's family, offering him a home and saying they understand his reticence. David has also been praying to the "God of green pastures and still waters", and a priest explains that while some people say there are many gods, there really is Christianity and Judaism only one. When he meets Sophie, a middle-aged lady who lives in Switzerland and likes to paint as a hobby, she asks David if she might paint him; later she invites David to have lunch with her in her house, and while he is there, David sees a picture of a woman in Denmark. Sophie tells him that the woman's husband and her child, a boy named David, were killed, but that a guard who was attracted to the woman allowed her to escape. He realizes he needs to travel to Denmark and find that woman, who is his mother. He also realizes that the guard who became the commandant has saved him because he was in love with David's mother. However, because she did not love him back, and the commandant felt a need for revenge, he did not tell her that David was still alive. When winter hits, David travels through the mountains, and he is held prisoner by a farmer who uses him for work. It is a hard season, but he is grateful to shelter at night in the farmer's stable until the snow melts. The farmer's dog, King, keeps him company through the winter. David knows that as the snow melts, he must escape from the bolted stable, as the farmer will soon hand him to the police. He makes a hole in the stable, digs a tunnel, and is free again. King catches up with him. Later, the dog gives his life to distract some guards in East Germany so that David can sneak over the border. David travels on through Denmark to Copenhagen where he looks up his mother's address in a telephone book, which he does find. Virtually at the end of his strength he knocks on the door of "the house" and introduces himself to his mother whom he recognizes from the picture he saw of her in Switzerland. His mother instantly recognizes him as her son David. Gladly she takes her son into her house and that is the end of the story. ==Awards== *Lewis Carroll Shelf Award *American Library Association Notable Book *Best Scandinavian Children's Book *Boys Club of America Junior Book Award Gold Medal ==Release details== * David, [København] Gyldendal, 1963 * I am David, Orlando, Fla. : Harcourt, 2004, (hc), (pbk) * The Best Scandinavian Children's Book awarded in 1995 == References == * Gale Children's Literature Review, vol. 75, 136-141 * Gale Contemporary Authors, vol. 17 * Kraks Blaa Bog (Danish Who's Who) 1998 == External links == * Review by Readingmatters.co.uk Category:1963 Danish novels Category:Children's historical novels Category:Danish novels adapted into films Category:Gyldendal books Category:Danish children's literature Category:Novels set in Europe Category:1963 children's books Category:Children's books set in Switzerland Category:Children's books set in Denmark Category:Children's books set in Italy

Fearful and suspicious of anyone, he has with him a precious "symbol" to be absolutely hidden from the eyes of the curious, a white dove locked in a cage. During a stop on the train, a gust of wind takes away his hat where he has hidden all his money: he goes down to retrieve it, but his sudden departure separates him from the rest of the delegation. The hat with the money is recovered by Mario, an aspiring sacristan accompanied by a priest in the convent, who chases it in vain to try to return it: thanks to a ride in the car, he ends up in Venice but finds himself lost and alone. Having met Marisa, a beautiful flower girl whom he soon falls in love with, he involuntarily frees the dove, symbol of peace in Piazza San Marco, which flies away with the pigeons and seeks help in the party's city headquarters. Due to various misunderstandings, he is chased first by a fanatic Communist and then by a fervent republican. Refugee in the house of the relatives of the flower girl, his mild nature soon leads him into trouble: after having attended a wedding dinner he finds himself in the house of a count where he is coveted by an aristocrat. Discovered by Marisa, he is soon forgiven, but the three of the delegation discover him and, considering him a traitor, they pursue him to bring him back to his homeland. Boris, in the throes of nightmares, is therefore forced to make a decision, which will be the most obvious one: he will stay in Italy with the girl. == Distribution == The film obtained the censorship visa no. 13,743 of February 23, 1953 for a film length of 2,540 meters and had its first screening on March 3, 1953. ==Cast== * Renato Rascel: Boris Popovic * Tina Lattanzi * Marisa Pavan: Marisa * Nino Manfredi * Carlo Mazzarella * Margherita Bagni: la fioraia * Dina Perbellini * Eduardo Passarelli * Cesco Baseggio * Giulio Calì * Pietro Tordi: un comunista * Michele Abbruzzo * Ave Ninchi: Giovanna * Ignazio Leone * Gianni Rizzo * Kiki Urbani * Paolo Panelli * Frederick Valk * Gino Cavalieri * Ettore Mattia ==References== ==Bibliography== * Parish, Robert.

Besides being released as a single and on the Reptile studio album, the song was released to several compilation albums and B-side single releases. AllMusic critic William Ruhlmann notes that by "remaking [the] song by Wonder means competing with [him] vocally, and as a singer Clapton isn't up to the challenge. He is assisted by the current five-man version of the Impressions, who do much to shore up his vocal weaknesses, but he still isn't a disciplined or thoughtful singer. Of course, when that distinctive electric guitar sound kicks in, all is forgiven". Although the song was well received in digital media, it did not make a big splash on the international music charts, reaching only position 63 in Switzerland and peaking at number six on the Polish LP3 single chart. ===Music video=== A music video to accompany the single release was shot on February 14, 2001 during the Reptile World Tour rehearsal. The official music video starts with a rehearsal photo session and later features Eric Clapton and his band – namely Andy Fairweather Low, Steve Gadd, Nathan East, Paulinho da Costa, David Sancious and The Impressions – performing the song, while early biographical pictures of Clapton can be seen. During other passages of the video, early childhood memories of the band members are shown. While performing the song in the rehearsal situation, sounds of Clapton and his band talking, laughing and playing table football can be seen and heard. The video to "I Ain't Gonna Stand for It" fades out to another rehearsal section, as the music does also, to the end. It was published under license of the Warner Music Group originally in 2001 for TV broadcasting and was made available legally via various Internet platforms in 2007. ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2001) Peak position Hungary Airplay (Music and Media) 15 Poland (LP3) 6 Poland Airplay (Music and Media) 1 Romania (Romanian Top 100) 87 Spain Airplay (Music and Media) 4 ==References== Category:1980 singles Category:2001 singles Category:1980 songs Category:Eric Clapton songs Category:Stevie Wonder songs Category:Motown singles Category:Songs written by Stevie Wonder Category:Reprise Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Stevie Wonder
23785213	I Am... Yours	I Am... Yours was the first concert residency by American singer Beyoncé. It was held four consecutive nights in July and August 2009 in support of her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). The residency was held at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in Las Vegas, Nevada. Beyoncé performed over thirty songs backed by an orchestra and her all-female band, the Suga Mamas, to an audience of 1,500. The residency was deemed "an intimate encounter" as Beyoncé portrayed a more raw and uninhibited show versus her previous concert performances. The concept of the shows revolves around Beyoncé's recording career. I Am... Yours received positive response from music critics who praised the intimate performances and Beyoncé's vocals as well as the jazz, funk and orchestral arrangements of the songs. The success of I Am... Yours has led Wynn Resorts to ask Beyoncé to return as a residency act. A double disc CD and DVD, I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas, was released in November 2009, featuring the performance recorded on August 2, 2009. It contained the full concert, a behind-the-scenes feature, along with an audio CD of the concert. I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas was aired on several TV Networks as a special. ==Background and development== thumb|left|The concerts were held at the Encore Theater in Wynn Las Vegas to a standing-audience. When Beyoncé's I Am... Tour (2009–2010), was announced in 2008 by Entertainment Weekly, the article mentioned Beyoncé would perform a week-long Las Vegas showcase. As tour dates were announced, it was later revealed that Beyoncé would perform four shows in Las Vegas. The concerts were held at the Encore Theatre in Las Vegas, Nevada to a standing room-only audience of 1,500. Tickets for the first three shows were sold out after they were made available, but the ones for the fourth night were sold slowly with Las Vegas Sun reporting that ninety percent of the tickets were sold. The prices for the tickets were from $250 to $1,000. According to Beyoncé, the show is an "unplugged" version of her normal concerts; she removed all the elaborate costumes and theatrics of her latest tour and performed with her band, Suga Mama, and a small team of dancers. Regarding the concerts, she told ABC News, > "I've always wanted to perform in Las Vegas, I've always wanted to do my own > show there, because a lot of the icons that I look up to had amazing shows > in Las Vegas. I thought if I'm going to have my own Las Vegas show, it has > to be right and it has to have heart and soul and it has to be something > memorable... My whole objective here is for people to see what they don't > get to see. Just give me my band, give me a stage, some cool smoke and > lights and you see the sweat, you see the pain, you see the love, you see > the soul and it's about music." During the documentary, "What Happens in Vegas...", Beyoncé stated that when the idea of a Vegas show was presented to her, she wanted the show to be a complete 180 from her current tour. Also, she did not want it to be the typical Las Vegas showcase. She wanted to remove the theatrics and "consciously show that I don't need any of that stuff. Just give me my band, a stage and some cool smoke and lights." Beyoncé and her production quickly organized the show in seven days, based on a script provided by filmmaker Matthew Dickens. She often rehearsed during sound checks of her 2009 tour. The concept of the shows revolves around Beyoncé's recording career, from her early childhood beginnings to the star she is today. She revealed, "In the beginning, I'm gonna start out, sing and make it about my songwriting, my arrangements, my band and my love for music. Then, I'm gonna tell my story. This way, I can sing all of the hit songs, the songs that people want. But, it's a deeper meaning... these songs meant more than just the chorus that's catchy... it's my life." Since the show was created last minute, there were many changes. Originally, the set list included, "Ego", "At Last", "Listen", "Ring the Alarm", and "Upgrade U". These songs were later removed from the set list and a new one was added with additional instruments. The success of the show has led Wynn Resorts to ask Beyoncé to return as a residency act. ==About the show== ===Fashion and stage=== The stage contained wind machines, lasers, arena lighting, a teleprompter on the back and a retro, mood-lit platform during the performances of the songs. According to Nate Chinen of The New York Times, "the stagecraft... keeps a viewer at a worshipful remove". During a statement before the show, Beyoncé revealed, "We have designed an elegant and beautiful stage and we will have new costumes that are being designed especially for this show." Beyoncé is accompanied by an orchestra and her 18-member all-female band on stage "whose satin interpretations pump lush over pomp" according to Mike Ragogna of The Huffington Post. She is also backed by several dancers during the performances of several songs and also appears alone during some performances. The choreography for the show was developed by Beyoncé's collaborator Frank Jr. Gatson. The set list included performances of over thirty songs, both from Beyoncé's solo career and as part of the girl group Destiny's Child. During the show, one major costume change was made. Beyoncé first appeared in beaded Jean Paul Gaultier couture and then in a cape-like jacket for the first half of the show. Both pieces were worn on top of a figure-flaunting grey bodysuit. For the second part, Beyoncé traded the bodysuit for a black sequined, bathing suit-like number. Several costumes for the stage during the show were also designed by Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles, who was her designer for many years. Arseniuk of Las Vegas Weekly praised the costumes of the show, saying that Beyoncé "sparkled from beginning to end". She noted that the first costume "left little to the imagination" while the second one "left no curve unnoticed". ===Show synopsis=== The show begins with a narrator introducing Beyoncé to the audience. She appears from the back of the theater performing "Hello". She greets the audience and makes her way towards the stage as she continues to perform. At the stage, Beyoncé sings "Halo". Next, she performs "Irreplaceable" and interacts with the audience. She later moves into an acoustic medley, performing a down-tempo version of "Sweet Dreams", "Dangerously in Love 2" and "Sweet Love" (originally recorded by Anita Baker). The medley leads into "If I Were a Boy" (which contains excerpts from "You Oughta Know") and "Scared of Lonely". The show continues with a performance of "That's Why You're Beautiful", intertwined with excerpts from "The Beautiful Ones" (originally recorded by Prince), "Satellites", and "Resentment". The first act concludes with Beyoncé performing a jazz-fused "Déjà Vu". Before the next act begins, three dancers appear and perform a tap sequence called "Bebop". Beyoncé begins the second act by telling the story of her career, starting from when she was nine years old when she auditioned for the talent show Star Search to her then-latest album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). Beyoncé highlights that one of the first songs she remembers learning was Michael Jackson's "I Wanna Be Where You Are". She continues with a medley of Destiny's Child's hits songs, including "No No No", "Bug a Boo", "Bills, Bills, Bills", and "Say My Name" whilst in between the songs, she talks about the story behind them. The medley leads into "Work It Out" and "'03 Bonnie & Clyde", as she now begins to talk about the start her solo career. As the set continues, Beyoncé explains how her record company felt her debut album did not have "one" hit song. She sarcastically remarks, "I guess they were kinda right... I had five." Beyoncé goes on to perform "Crazy in Love" (reminiscent of "Proud Mary" by Tina Turner), "Naughty Girl" and "Get Me Bodied". As the show draws to a close, Beyoncé performs "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"; she then exits the stage after thanking the audience for their presence. ==Critical reception== Overall, the show received a positive response from many music critics. Mike Weatherford of the Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote, "The spectacle rivals Celine Dion's 'A New Day' as the singer transforms from fragile soul to the rock warrior alter ego of her album title, I Am ... Sasha Fierce." Melissa Arseniuk of Las Vegas Weekly wrote in her review of the show, "Once Beyoncé took to the stage, she hardly left it. Appearing both on her own and with back-up dancers, she worked the theater from left to right throughout the showcase. She sang, danced, and looked good while she did it... Indeed, the mezzo-soprano is as easy on the eyes as she is on the ears." John Griffiths of Us Weekly described the concert as "lavish". Andy Kellman from Allmusic wrote, "The show is certainly a theatrical production worthy of Vegas, with Beyoncé and her large backing band energetically rolling through the singer's back catalog." Darryl Sterdan of the website Jam! commented: "Only Beyonce would think an 'intimate' theatre gig should include her massive all-girl band, an orchestra, lasers, dancers, costume changes and a wind machine to keep her hair blowing majestically. And only Beyonce could pull it all together as superbly as she does in this 98-minute... show". A writer of The Boston Globe praised I Am... Yours, comparing it with Sin City. He commended the jazz interlude, the acoustic rearrangements of the songs, and the "charming B[eyoncé] telling her life story in [the] song[s]". Mike Ragogna of The Huffington Post compared Beyoncé with Diana Ross during the show and added: "This 'concert' is a staged, stripped-down reconfiguration by Beyoncé... of her current touring extravaganza that covers her biggest hits... as she whisks us through her career highlights in two tidy acts plus an 'intermission' that is nothing of the sort (it's a jazz medley with a dance payoff)." He finished his review by saying, "Beyoncé's I Am...Yours is a satisfying decade-and-then-some retrospective that reveals the artist's interesting back story with a personal warmth". Mike Diver of BBC Online reviewed the show positively and said, "this is an entirely second-guessable affair, each movement telegraphed and every realigned arrangement (bombast turned down, jazz and funk switched up) meeting the listener's expectations head on." The writer of People magazine described the show as a "magic". Nate Chinen of The New York Times positively noted that I Am... Yours documents a smaller show than the other ones Beyoncé usually makes. A less favorable review came from Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly. She writes, "I just wish this special had the balls to call itself 'I Am…Mine' and admit that among the many things we admire about Beyonce is that she's not ours. In fact the opposite's true. We're hers". ==Broadcasts and recordings== A double disc CD and DVD, titled I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas, was released in November 2009, featuring the performance recorded on August 2, 2009. The collection featured the full concert (though her cover of "The Beautiful Ones" was not present), a behind-the-scenes feature, along with an audio CD of the concert.Sources about the content of I Am...

24047175	I Build the Tower	I Build the Tower is a feature-length documentary film depicting the life of Sabato Rodia also known as Sam Rodia and Simon Rodia, the Italian immigrant who created the Watts Towers in South Los Angeles. The film has been recognized by Robert Koehler in Variety as "the most complete visual account of Rodia and his masterpiece". == Production == Completed in 2006, I Build the Tower was directed, written and produced by Edward and Brad Byer. The project was initiated by Byer's extensive research into the life of Rodia, his great- uncle. With exclusive access to a wealth of family materials, Byer teamed up with independent filmmaker Edward who had been working with Watts community groups for several years. Together they started production by filming the last recorded interview with architect, designer and futurist Buckminster Fuller, three months before his death in 1983. Hailing Rodia as "one of the greatest sculptors of the twentieth century", Fuller analyzed Rodia's intuitive understanding of aesthetics and natural engineering principles. The filmmakers went on to shoot their film throughout Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area and southern Italy, and managed to sustain the vitality of their work while waiting years for the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department to remove the scaffolding erected for the restoration of the towers. The narrative of the documentary is drawn from audio interviews of Rodia recorded in the early 1960s. In his own words and voice, Rodia himself chronicles his redemption from alcoholism and despair to a fierce determination to build "something big". The story is filled out by recent interviews with relatives, neighbors and other witnesses who have come into close contact with the Watts Towers, including artist John Outterbridge and historian Mike Davis. Phil Proctor of the Firesign Theater gives voice to historic trial proceedings involving Rodia. The film's musical score is based on the opera arias of Giuseppe Verdi – the music Rodia loved – and spans the time and distance from nineteenth century Italy to present-day Los Angeles. The classical score was arranged and conducted by noted silent film music composer Robert Israel. Jazz pianist Nate Morgan composed an original jazz score using Verdi's themes and performed by Morgan's ensemble. Filmmakers Byer and conceived a hip-hop song incorporating Rodia's own voice as lead vocal, backed up by jazz vocalists Dwight Trible and Logan Johnson, Jr., set to music by Michael Abels. In April, 2009, I Build the Tower was the opening presentation of "Art and Migration: Sabato Rodia's Watts Towers in Los Angeles", the first international conference on the Watts Towers. The conference was held in Genoa, Italy, sponsored by the University of Genoa and the U.C.L.A. International Institute. == Reception == I Build the Tower has been praised by documentary filmmaker Ken Burns as "wonderful, lyrical and compelling", and by film critic Leonard Maltin as "heartfelt and fascinating... a real discovery". == References == * Christopher R.

24246927	I Ain't Movin'	I Ain't Movin is the second studio album by British soul singer-songwriter Des'ree. It was released on 9 May 1994 in the UK, and 5 July 1994 in the US on Epic Records, and features the top 5 smash hit, "You Gotta Be". ==Critical reception== Tom Demalon of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing that "Des'ree possesses a pleasing vocal delivery, and it serves her well on songs like the slinky, mid-tempo 'Feel So High,' the breezy 'Little Child,' the hypnotic groove of 'Trip on Love' and the confessional title cut." ==Singles== Three singles were released from I Ain't Movin: "You Gotta Be", "I Ain't Movin'" and "Little Child". In the US, "Feel So High" was featured on and released as a single from I Ain't Movin' rather than from Des'ree's debut album Mind Adventures.

24310763	I Am the Future	"I Am the Future" is a 1982 song by rock musician Alice Cooper. The song was one of two singles released from his 1982 album Zipper Catches Skin. The single did not chart, and despite the advent of MTV at the time a promotional video was not created for it. The song was produced by Steve Tyrell, and written by Gary Osborne and Lalo Schifrin. The 1982 US single featured the album version of the song and "Tag, You're It" as its B-side. The international single version, released in March 1983 in most countries, featured a remix of the song, and had "Zorro's Ascent" as its B-side. Like "I Am the Future", both B-sides are also featured on the Zipper Catches Skin album. The remix version of "I Am the Future" was eventually included in 1999's The Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper box set. ==Releases on albums== * Zipper Catches Skin - album version * The Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper - remix version ==References== Category:1983 singles Category:Songs with lyrics by Gary Osborne Category:Alice Cooper songs Category:Warner Records singles Category:1982 songs Category:American new wave songs Category:American pop rock songs

24501467	I Am My Own Woman	I Am My Own Woman (German: Ich bin meine eigene Frau ) is a 1992 German semi- documentarian film directed by Rosa von Praunheim. The film attracted international attention and was shown at the Berlin International Film Festival and the Toronto Film Festival in 1993, for example.Kuzniar, The Queer German Cinema, p. 111 ==Plot== The trans woman Charlotte von Mahlsdorf recounts incidents from her eventful life. Now elderly, she runs the Gründerzeit Museum, fulfilling her dream of living as a woman from the turn of the 20th century. Scenes of her life are dramatized. Two actors play the young and middle-aged Charlotte and she plays herself in old age. Life was difficult for Charlotte, growing up as Lothar Berfelde in Nazi Germany during World War II. An effeminate boy, Lothar enjoyed cleaning and dusting at the home of a benevolent great uncle; an early desire to live as a woman finally found an outlet on a vacation to Eastern Prussia in the household of "aunt" Luise, a transgender man, who allows the youth to try out female outfits and dress at home as a girl, and giving Lothar the book The Transvestite by Dr Magnus Hirschfeld to read. Luise also respects the youth's privacy when he finds him having sex in the barn with a farm boy. Back in Berlin, after the death of a great uncle, the young Lothar is found at the complete mercy of his brutal father. Trying to save his mother and himself from his father's punishments and threats, Lothar bludgeons his father to death, a crime for which he is psychiatrically evaluated and imprisoned. The defeat of Germany during the war and the Allied invasion sets the boy free. Wandering through the street of Berlin, he barely escapes being killed as a deserter by German soldiers. By 1946 Lothar has come to identify herself as a feminine being in a masculine body. She lives now full-time as a woman under the name Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, "Charlotte" or "Lottchen" being similar to Lothar, and Mahlsdorf referring to the section of Berlin where she lives. She moves into the destroyed Friedrishfelde castle and spends years and a lot of hard work trying to restore it. But eventually, she is expelled by the East German authorities. Working as a domestic in the household of Herbert von Zitzenau, an elderly equestrian officer, she is seduced by her employer and they start a sexual relationship. She explains that she preferred older lovers feeling protected by them the way women do. That affair lasted several years until Zitzenau's health declined and death. Even though life for gays is difficult under the communist regime of East Germany, they find their way around. Cruising a public restroom, Charlotte meets Joechen, a lover with whom she could be a real woman. Their relation with sadomasochistic role-playing last for 27 years until Joechen's death. For more than 30 years Charlotte manages to live her life as a woman in East Germany. She preserves the entire contents of East Berlin's first (and only for many years) gay bar, after the DDR government closed the bar, and moved to demolish the building. Its contents were transferred to the Gründerzeit Museum in Mahlsdorf run by Charlotte and a lesbian couple. In 1989 the elderly Charlotte, very much active, takes a role in the first East German gay film: Heiner Carow's Coming Out. Its premiere coincides with the fall of the Berlin Wall. But even in a unified Germany Charlotte has to face many problems. The German government takes the Gründerzeit Museum and its contents from Charlotte's hands and she and her gay friends are attacked by neo-Nazis during the first joint East–West gay and lesbian gathering. In 1992 her labor is recognized when she receives the Cross of the Order of Merit from the government for furthering the cause of sexual freedom. ==Cast== Two actors play the young and middle-aged Charlotte, and she plays herself in the later years. * Charlotte von Mahlsdorf - Herself * Jens Taschner – Lothar age 15-17 * Ichgola Androgyn - Charlotte age 20-40 * Robert Dietl - Herbert von Zitzenau ==Awards== 1993: FIPRESCI Award at the International Film Festival Rotterdam ==Reception== "A moving picture."

24519921	I Can Transform Ya	"I Can Transform Ya" is a song by American singer Chris Brown from his third album Graffiti. The song features vocals from American rappers Lil Wayne and Swizz Beatz. The artists co-wrote the song with Lonny Bereal, Trayce Green, and Jason "Poo Bear" Boyd, with Beatz producing the track. The song was released as the lead single from Graffiti on September 29, 2009, and was Brown's first official release since his altercation with former girlfriend, Barbadian singer Rihanna. Originally known simply as "Transformer", it is an electro-composed song infused with hip hop, crunk and "industrial" R&B; musical genres, while making use of robotic tones. It is lyrically about introducing someone to a life of luxury. "I Can Transform Ya" received mostly positive reviews, noting the song's club feel and catchiness. The song peaked the highest in New Zealand, at number seven, and was also certified platinum in the country. It peaked in the top twenty of the United States, at twenty- one in Australia and Ireland. The song also charted in the top thirty in the United Kingdom, becoming a top ten hit on the UK R&B; Chart. The dance-heavy accompanying music video, coined a "shiny, sexy, throwback" features choreography with hooded ninjas, and makes puns on the Transformers franchise. ==Background== The song was originally titled "Transformer" according to producer and featured guest Swizz Beatz in a September 2009 interview with MTV News. The song was set to be the first real record that Brown had released since his highly-publicized domestic violence case against then-girlfriend Rihanna at the beginning of the year. Another song "Changed Man", an "apologetic ode to Rihanna" written by Brown, and several other tracks were leaked but Jive Records said the material was old. Swizz Beatz said that Brown had recorded "60 or 70" songs for the album, and that "He's got something to prove." Beatz also commented on Lil Wayne's contribution to the song, saying, ""The Wayne part is just nothing to talk about, He really showed his ass on this one. It's probably the best feature verse since the 'It's Me [Bitches]' remix. He really went in on the 'Transformer' joint." It was originally supposed released on September 30, 2009, but Brown stated on his Twitter that the song would be released a day early on September 29, 2009. ==Composition== The song, influenced by hip-hop, has been described as an "upbeat tune", is composed of pounding drums, and features referee whistles and hand claps. It also has synthpop elements, featuring a "synthesized guitar riff." Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times says the song has a robo-crunk groove. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, the song is an "adult club track". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that the song is one of the album tracks featuring an "aggressive stance" and "club banger" that would "sound fantastic on the dancefloor". The song is lyrically about introducing someone new to a luxurious life. The song makes references to the Transformers franchise. ==Music video== ===Background=== The song's music video was directed by Joseph Kahn. Kahn, who also directed the video for Brown and Ester Dean's "Drop It Low", said that Brown played him tracks from his album on the set, and had a clear idea of what he wanted for the "I Can Transform Ya" video. Kahn said, > "...obviously, him going in there and dancing and turning into cars and > trucks is right up my alley. His interests, in terms of kung fu and special > effects and science fiction and all the boy-culture stuff, it falls directly > in line with what I like. "His talent is phenomenal. I'm still struggling to > try and capture that talent on film, and it's a challenge. Here's a guy who > can literally do anything. If you watch this thing, he's doing nunchuck > tricks, and I'm a huge kung fu aficionado, and they're mind-blowing. I've > never seen stuff like that before in kung fu flicks. I would say it's like a > pure aesthetic dance video from the very fiber of it. Everything dances > onscreen. Everything has movement. Everything has a certain mechanical > rhythm. He actually created a dance style for this that is mechanical. It's > sort of a hyper-intense version of the robot. Even the transformations go > directly in line with the movements." Kahn also said that instead of taking the song's lyrics and being "pretentious" about it, he wanted to show the audience exactly what Brown was singing about, commenting, "What if we just got ambitious and demonstrated the lyrics? The trick is to do it in a creative way. Let's try to display the lyrics and the feeling of the dance at the same time." In October 2009, Brown released screencaps for the video, coincidentally the same day Rihanna released her video for "Russian Roulette". The photos showed several scenes, including Brown in the middle of a squadron of black storm troopers, Brown in a gray suit, and him giving a karate kick in mid-air. Another was also of Brown, Wayne and Swizz Beatz standing confidently against a white backdrop. ===Synopsis and reception=== thumb|200px|right|Brown wearing an unzipped black hooded jacket, spray painting the title of the song The video premiered on MTV Networks on October 27, 2009. The music video opens with Brown transforming from a black sports car, and spray painting the name of the single onto the screen, indirectly referencing his forthcoming album Graffiti. The video, set entirely on an all-white backdrop, focuses on Brown's dance moves, as Brown performs alongside hooded ninjas. Several other "transformations" are made in the video including from motorcycles and helicopters. Swizz Beatz appears in the clip, as well as Lil Wayne, playing an electric guitar. Transformers star Tyrese Gibson makes a cameo appearance. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News described the video as "glossy" and "fast-paced". James Montgomery of MTV News called the video a "shiny, sexy throwback". Montgomery also said, "It's a blockbuster, loaded with eye-popping special effects — the titular transformations are particularly great looking, as are the scene-to-scene transitions — and frighteningly precise pop-and-lock moves from Brown himself." Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said the clip was "snazzy-looking", but commented, "it feels … kind of gross." BET's Sound Off Blog said, "the visual embodies exactly what the title represents- transforming into abnormal objects while doing splits and showing off some several thick wasted PYT’s." The video's choreography and dancers resembling "cyber ninjas" also drew comparisons to Janet Jackson's "Feedback" by several critics. ==Critical reception== The song received generally positive reviews. Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune gave the song a positive review, calling it a "club banger". Thomas Gonlianpoulous of Spin commended Swizz Beatz' "bombastic production", Wayne's "energetic yet nonsensical rap", and Brown's "joyful, brisk vocals." Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song, serving as lead single, says "Brown's promise for the future is to be an altogether more interesting kind of R&B; artist." Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly referred to the song as a "swaggering" lead single. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times referred to the song as a type that he has made his specialty, and called it an "electric, brassy collaboration." Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy called the song "a brutal, tuneless hunk of industrial R&B; \- as musically ugly as something like 'With You' was pretty", he said "for that matter, this track rocks", commenting "Whatever you may think of him, you can't claim that Chris Brown lacks balls." Jude Rogers of BBC Music said the song was catchy, but was one of the album's tracks that were a "pale imitation of Justin Timberlake album tracks." ==Chart performance== In the United States, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number fifty-two. After weeks of ascending and descending the charts the single reached a peak of twenty on its eighth week on the chart, giving Brown his eighth top twenty hit in the United States. Also in the U.S., the song peaked at number eleven on the Hot R&B;/Hip Hop Songs. In Canada, the song entered the charts at seventy-five. The song fluctuated around the charts for seven weeks before finally peaking at fifty-four on its eight week. It reached five on the Flanders and Wallonia Belgian Tip Charts. The song peaked at number seven in New Zealand, where it spent seven weeks on the chart. "I Can Transform Ya" peaked in the top thirty in the United Kingdom, and Ireland, whilst reaching number nine on the UK R&B; Chart. In Australia it peaked at twenty-one, where it spent eighteen weeks on the chart. It reached fifty-seven on the Mega Single Top 100 in the Netherlands, having a seven-week stint. "I Can Transform Ya"'s charting in European marks propelled it to debut and peak at seventy-six on the European Hot 100. The song was certified Platinum in New Zealand by the RIANZ and Gold in Australia by the ARIA. ==Credits and personnel== *Vocals - Chris Brown, Lil Wayne, Swizz Beatz *Songwriting - Chris Brown, Jason "Poo Bear" Boyd, Kasseem Dean, Joseph "Lonny" Bereal, Dwayne Carter *Production - Swizz Beatz *Audio Mixing - Manny Marroquin, assisted by Christian Plata and Erik Madrid *Recording Engineer - Brian Springer *Guitar - Rayfield "Ray-Ray" Holloman *Mastering - Chris Bellman Source Chris Brown Graffiti (Liner notes) Jive Records, RCA Records, Zomba Label Group.

24768455	I Corps (German Empire)	The I Army Corps / I AK () was a corps level command of the Prussian and then the Imperial German Armies from the 19th Century to World War I. It was established with headquarters in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Initially, the Corps catchment area comprised the entire Province of East Prussia, but from 1 October 1912 the southern part of the Province was transferred to the newly formed XX Corps District.German Administrative History Accessed: 5 June 2012 In peacetime, the Corps was assigned to the I Army Inspectorate, which became the 8th Army at the start of the First World War. The corps was still in existence at the end of the war, and was disbanded with the demobilisation of the German Army after World War I. == Austro- Prussian War == The I Corps fought in the Austro-Prussian War against Austria in 1866, including the Battle of Trautenau and the Battle of Königgrätz.Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935); Bredow == Franco-Prussian War == The Corps served in the Franco- Prussian War against France in 1870–1871.

The 25 peacetime Corps of the German Army (Guards, I - XXI, I - III Bavarian) had a reasonably standardised organisation. Each consisted of two divisions with usually two infantry brigades, one field artillery brigade and a cavalry brigade each. Each brigade normally consisted of two regiments of the appropriate type, so each Corps normally commanded 8 infantry, 4 field artillery and 4 cavalry regiments. There were exceptions to this rule: :V, VI, VII, IX and XIV Corps each had a 5th infantry brigade (so 10 infantry regiments) :II, XIII, XVIII and XXI Corps had a 9th infantry regiment :I, VI and XVI Corps had a 3rd cavalry brigade (so 6 cavalry regiments) :the Guards Corps had 11 infantry regiments (in 5 brigades) and 8 cavalry regiments (in 4 brigades).They formed the Guards Cavalry Division, the only peacetime cavalry division in the German Army.

2493193	I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man	"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" is a song written and recorded by American musician Prince. It was released as the final single from his ninth studio album Sign o' the Times (1987), becoming the third top-ten hit off the album. It has since been covered by numerous artists. ==Content== The song is an upbeat pop number featuring a combination of live drumming with two drum machine patterns. Also featured are two guitar solos, one wild and energetic and one more bluesy and subdued in the full album cut. The song consists of two verses and two choruses, followed by a lengthy instrumental coda. The lyrics paint the image of a woman seeking a man to replace the one who left, while Prince refuses, saying that she would not be satisfied with a one-night stand. The music and accompanying music video pushed this song to the top 10 in the US. The video was taken from the Sign “☮” the Times film, and is a live take of the song and included the horn section of Eric Leeds and Atlanta Bliss. Cash Box called it an "exceptional tune [that] is skillfully produced and performed." The live version of "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" from the video and the Sign “☮” the Times film includes a horn solo in the song's coda. The solo lifts a part of the "Camille" and Black Album track, "Rock Hard in a Funky Place". ==B-side== The single was backed with "Hot Thing", also from Sign “☮” the Times. The 12-inch single includes the full album version of "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man", as well as several remixes of "Hot Thing". One of these was included on the Ultimate compilation album in 2006. "Hot Thing" received enough airplay by DJs to chart on its own, reaching No. 63. ==Track listing== ===7": Paisley Park / 7-28288 (US)=== # "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" (fade) – 3:39 # "Hot Thing" (edit) – 3:40 ===12": Paisley Park / 0-20728 (UK)=== # "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" – 6:31 # "Hot Thing" (edit) – 3:40 # "Hot Thing" (Extended Remix) – 8:32 # "Hot Thing" (Dub Version) – 6:53 === 12": Warner Bros / W8288T (UK) === # "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" – 6:31 # "Hot Thing" (edit) – 3:40 # "Hot Thing" (Extended Remix) – 8:32 *also released as a picture disc (W8288TP) == Personnel == Credits from Duane Tudahl, Benoît Clerc and Guitarcloud * Prince – lead and backing vocals, electric and acoustic guitars, Fairlight CMI, Oberheim OB-8, bass guitar, LinnDrum, handclaps * Susannah Melvoin - possible backing vocals ==Charts== Chart (1987–88) Peak position ==Jordan Knight version== Jordan Knight, of New Kids on the Block, recorded a cover of the song as a ballad for his 1999 self-titled solo debut.

2499506	I Am a Wallet	I Am a Wallet is the debut studio album by English indie pop band McCarthy. It was first released in November 1987. After recording three singles, "In Purgatory", "Red Sleeping Beauty" and "Frans Hals", I Am a Wallet demonstrates jangly guitar pop reminiscent of The Byrds. While this form of indie pop was widespread in '80s underground Britain, McCarthy brought left-wing politics to the genre. Religion is attacked in "God Made the Virus", while the return of Victorian values espoused by Margaret Thatcher is compared to medieval oppression in "In the Dark Times". Johnny Dee of Underground magazine gave the album a 3/3 review, naming it as his favourite record of the year. I Am a Wallet has since been described by Nicky Wire as "the most perfect record, a Communist manifesto with tunes". On the album cover of the 2007 re-release he writes that McCarthy "are partly to blame for the realisation of the Manic Street Preachers". James Dean Bradfield rated I Am a Wallet as his top British album of all time. The cover art features Georg Grosz's painting Widmung an Oskar Panizza (The Funeral). == Track listing == #"An MP Speaks" – 2:10 #"Monetaries" – 1:57 #"The International Narcotics Traffic" – 2:25 #"The Way of the World" – 2:28 #"Antinature" – 1:42 #"Charles Windsor" – 1:38 #"The Vision of Peregrine Worsthorne" – 2:50 #"The Well of Loneliness" – 2:29 #"The Wicked Palace Revolution" – 2:32 #"God Made the Virus" – 1:40 #"The Funeral" – 1:51 #"A Child Soon in Chains" – 1:46 #"In the Dark Times" – 1:44 #"The Procession of Popular Capitalism" – 3:07 == Re-releases == In 1989, the album was re-released on CD with four bonus tracks from The Well of Loneliness EP.

25000194	I Am the College of William and Mary	I Am the College of William and Mary (also known simply as I Am the College) was written in 1945 by Dr. Dudley W. Woodbridge, esteemed professor (1927-1966) and inaugural dean of the revived Law School at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. The narrative poem recounts William & Mary's historic legacy as the seventh oldest college in the English-speaking world (second oldest in North America after Harvard University). Made popular by the Seven Society, Order of the Crown & Dagger, which adopted I Am the College as its official poem, Dean Woodbridge's verses are meant to foster unity and engender pride across the university. The poem is commonly cited by members of the William & Mary community and can be found displayed in a number of campus buildings and offices. ==Text== I Am the College of William and Mary by Dr. D. W. Woodbridge (1945) We are the beautiful buildings, the stately trees, the statue of Lord Botetourt, the friendly campus. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the scholars, the philosophers, the scientists that have pioneered human progress. We come from every corner of the globe and from the remotest periods of recorded history. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the youth whom the call of duty tore from the College’s bosom. We are fighting and dying in a thousand climes without a thought of personal sacrifice, that colleges like William and Mary might live. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the great freedoms of humanity: freedom of thought, freedom of press, freedom of conscience, freedom of speech in whose presence tyranny and falsehood cannot long survive. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the traditions of the College: the tradition of honor, the tradition of service, the tradition of loyalty. We are intangible, but whenever you think of the College, or sing her Alma Mater you feel that we are very real. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the City of Williamsburg and the Counties of York and James City. Our people serve the College in myriad ways, ministering to all her manifold needs. We are part of the College of William and Mary. I am the Commonwealth of Virginia. My history and that of the College are inseparable. I was at her side in her darkest hours, when her friends were penniless, her faculty dispersed, her halls empty. Through me, the humblest citizen contributes to her support so that she may live and prosper. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the people of the United States. Restored Williamsburg is our shrine. We come by the tens of thousands to be instructed and inspired. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the Board of Visitors. We determine the policies of the College. On the wisdom of these policies her very existence may depend. We give generously from busy lives without pecuniary reward. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the President and the Administration. We weld into one harmonious whole all the diverse elements of the College and cause them to function smoothly as an educated institution of the First Order. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the faculty. Into our hands is trusted the instruction of youth, humanity’s most precious possession. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the College’s activities: the athletics, the publications, the social clubs. We educate the students in courage, in honor, in dependability, and in the social graces. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the alumni, both living and dead, upon whose minds the imprint of the College has been planted. The College never forgets us though some of us may forget her. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the students. We attend our Alma Mater in never ending processions and receive bountiful gifts. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the fathers and mothers, the brothers and sisters, the friends and well wishers of the students in residence. We rejoice at their accomplishments. We are part of the College of William and Mary. We are the countless generations to come. The College was founded to serve us. We are part of the College of William and Mary. I am the College of William and Mary. I have been forged on the anvil of time by master workmen. I have faith in humanity under God. I believe in a glorious future. I am the College of William and Mary. == References == == External links == * Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award * Dudley Warner Woodbridge Professor of Law * Swem Special Collections Research Center (Dudley Warner Woodbridge) * Thomas Jefferson Award Category:1945 poems Category:College of William & Mary

25125549	I Can Dream About You	"I Can Dream About You" is a song performed by American singer Dan Hartman on the soundtrack album of the film Streets of Fire. Released in 1984 as a single from the soundtrack, and included on Hartman's album I Can Dream About You, it reached number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Background== The song first appeared in Streets of Fire, where it was performed by the fictional group The Sorels. The real voice behind the version used in the film was Winston Ford, but Hartman's version was the one used on the soundtrack album and released as a single. In a Songfacts interview with the film's musical director, Kenny Vance, he recalled the following: > "The same guy that sings lead on that and 'Countdown to Love,' a song that I > wrote for the film, was a guy working at a Radio Shack (Winston Ford), and I > think when you look at the film and The Sorels are singing it live in the > movie, that was the version that was supposed to come out, and I recorded > that version. But then when Dan Hartman heard it, I don't know what happened > next, but I know that he took that guy's voice off and he put his own on, > and he had a hit with it. Hollywood is a very slippery place." Originally, producer Jimmy Iovine had asked Hartman to write a song for a film he was working on. Hartman was told that the song was going to be sung by four Black guys in a concert situation within the film, and Hartman ended up thinking about a demo he made of "I Can Dream About You." As described by Tuber (1985), Hartman went through some “legal maneuvering to get the benefit of his breakthrough”. The use of the song in the film being performed by actors did not feature Hartman on vocals but rather Ford. After some negotiating to enforce the original contract, Hartman insisted he sing the song on the soundtrack, and that his version be released if a single were to be issued from the soundtrack album. Additionally, any music video had to feature his own voice using the song. These clauses helped Hartman become an "overnight sensation" despite the fact that Hartman had been a working musician since adolescence. In an interview snippet from Portzline (2014), Hartman elaborated on another controversy related to the song—stating that “…some people had a fit because it was my name and my voice coming out of this group that looked like the Temptations. It was a big mess, but it was the best I could do under the circumstance." In the film, the Sorels are played by Stoney Jackson (lead singer), Grand L. Bush, Mykelti Williamson and Robert Townsend (the latter three portraying backing singers). In a 2012 interview, Williamson stated that people were initially confused and thought that Jackson was Hartman. As a result, Hartman was supposedly upset; however, he might have had a change of heart by the following year due to the “good publicity” that the confusion generated (Tuber, 1985). Although the choreography for the Sorels was arranged by Jeffrey Hornaday, the actors eventually improvised much of the dance moves with Hornaday’s support. Williamson further mentioned that he, Jackson, Bush and Townsend received vocal coaching from Jim Gilstrap and they provided background vocals for the track. In the vinyl releases, Hartman, Joe Pizzulo, and Ford are credited as providing backing vocals for the song. Thus, in the interview, Williamson may have been referring to the version that appeared in the film with Ford's vocals. Frank and George Simms, who perform as The Simms Brothers Band and worked as backup singers for artists such as David Bowie, revealed in a 2021 podcast that they sang on "I Can Dream About You" as a favor to Hartman but were uncredited due to the song's quick release thereafter. According to Daryl Hall, Hartman had initially written the song with Hall & Oates in mind, and offered the song to them to record as their own. Hall & Oates declined, as their new album was about to be released. Later in their career, however, they issued an album of covers called Our Kind of Soul, in 2004, on which they recorded their own version (with changed lyrics) of Hartman's song. When performing the song live in February 2005, Hall revealed before the performance: > "Here's a song that we did on the new album that we sort of did twenty years > late. An old friend of ours, Dan Hartman, wrote this song. I remember back > in the day he came up to me and said 'You know, I have this great song I > wrote for you guys. It's you, you know? – you have to sing this song.' And > unfortunately we had just finished an album, we couldn't put it on the album > so I said sorry Dan. About six months later I was watching MTV and there it > was, and it was a hit for him, God bless him. So here we are twenty years > later, I hope he's hearing it, and I hope he enjoys it." Before Ford settled as a musician in Colorado, he went on to tour as a vocalist for artists such as The Platters, Earth, Wind & Fire, The Drifters and Phat Daddy. He died in a motor vehicle accident in 2007 in Denver. ==Album release and promotion== Both Hartman and Iovine worked on his 1984, same- titled solo album I Can Dream About You, following the song's use in the film. The album would spawn two other Top 40 charting singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 – "We Are the Young" and "Second Nature". A tour was also organized to promote the I Can Dream About You album and its singles, and Hartman toured alongside Toto in 1985. It was his first tour in a decade but also his last. The song was performed on this tour. ==Music videos and promotion== Two music videos accompanied the song. One does not feature Hartman and consists of scenes from Streets of Fire, intercut with footage of the fictional Sorels miming the song as part of a live performance. In the second video, filmed at the Hard Rock in London, Hartman appears as a bartender trying to charm a young woman (played by Joyce Hyser), singing to her as the Sorels' performance plays on a TV set hanging above the bar. In a 2010 interview with Hyser for the blog Old School: Back to the 80s, she was asked how she came to feature in the video. She replied, "I knew Dan's manager and he asked me if I would do it. We shot at the Hard Rock in London. I honestly remember very little about it, but Dan was very nice and I absolutely love that song." While recording a mimed TV performance of the song, Hartman explained why one music video featured actors: "The producers and directors of Streets of Fire wanted the best of everything, so they hired the best singers, the best dancers and best actors to play the parts in the film. So the singers in 'I Can Dream About You' who are the Sorels are actually actors, and I wrote and sang this song." Aside from the two music videos which accompanied the song, Hartman appeared on various American and European TV shows to perform the song once it was released as a single. On the musical variety show Soul Train, during December 1984, Hartman dubbed the song with his touring band, along with "We are the Young", and later appeared on the show solo in May 1985 to perform both "I Can Dream About You" and "Second Nature" alone, but with live vocal. He also dubbed the song on the music-performance program American Bandstand in December 1984, with his touring band. "Second Nature" was also performed, and both performances aired on the January 12, 1985, episode of the show. In November 1984, Hartman and his band performed the song on Late Night with David Letterman, along with "We Are the Young". It was also dubbed on the American syndicated half hour television show This Week's Music, where his name was incorrectly spelled as 'Harkman'. Within the UK, Hartman performed the song on Top of the Pops, dated August 29, 1985. He also dubbed the song on Cheggers Plays Pop, dated October 31, 1985. ==Track listing== ;7" Single #"I Can Dream About You" – 3:50 #"Blue Shadows" (performed by The Blasters) – 3:14 ;7" Single (American promo release) #"I Can Dream About You (Long Solo Version)" #"I Can Dream About You (Short Solo Version)" – 3:51 ;7" Single (Brazilian release) #"I Can Dream About You (Versão Solo Longa)" #"I Can Dream About You (Versão Solo Curta)" – 3:51 ;7" Single (1985 UK reissue) #"I Can Dream About You (Edited Version)" – 3:51 #"Instant Replay" – 3:25 ;12" Single (American and Italian release) #"I Can Dream About You (Jellybean Remix)" – 7:31 #"I Can Dream About You" – 4:23 #"I Can Dream About You (Instrumental)" – 4:23 ;12" Single (Australian, Canadian and US #2 release) #"I Can Dream About You (Extended Remix)" – 5:56 #"I Can Dream About You (Jellybean Remix)" – 7:31 ;12" Single (American promo release) #"I Can Dream About You (Jellybean Remix)" – 7:31 #"I Can Dream About You" – 4:23 #"I Can Dream About You (Instrumental)" – 4:23 ;12" Single (German release) #"I Can Dream About You (Jellybean Remix)" – 7:31 #"I Can Dream About You (Extended Remix)" – 5:56 ;12" Single (Spanish release) #"I Can Dream About You (Jellybean Remix)" – 7:31 #"I Can Dream About You (Instrumental)" – 4:23 #"Blue Shadows" (performed by The Blasters) – 3:14 ;12" Single (1985 UK release) #"I Can Dream About You (Extended Mix)" – 5:56 #"I Can Dream About You (7" Version)" – 3:51 #"Instant Replay" – 8:18 ;12" Single (1985 UK white label promo release) #"I Can Dream About You (Extended Mix)" – 5:56 #"Instant Replay" – 8:18 ==Critical reception== Alex Henderson of Allmusic reviewed the I Can Dream About You album and stated "This excellent album finds Hartman showing his enthusiasm for R&B; on pop/rock gems that range from the hit title song and the anthemic 'We Are the Young' to the Motown-tinged 'Name of the Game' and the new wave- ish 'Electricity'." In the Billboard magazine of November 3, 1984, another review of the album was published in the Pop Picks section, which meant that Billboard predicted the album to hit the top half of the chart. The review stated "The title track survived the failure of the 'Streets of Fire' motion picture to become a recent top 10 smash. Hartman follows it with an album reflecting the same broad-based pop/rock appeal." ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1984–85) Peak position Australia (Kent Music Report) 3 Belgian Singles Chart (Vl) 16 Canadian Adult Contemporary (RPM) 7 Canadian Singles Chart (RPM) 11 Dutch Singles Chart 18 French Singles Chart 62 Irish Singles Chart 4 New Zealand Singles Chart 47 South African Singles Chart 7 Swedish Singles Chart 13 UK Singles Chart 12 US Billboard Hot 100 6 US Billboard Adult Contemporary 7 US Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play 8 US Billboard Hot Black Singles 60 US Cash Box Top 100 Singles 6 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1984) Rank Australia (Kent Music Report) 24 Canada RPM Top Singles 93 US Billboard Hot 100 29 US Cash Box http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/80s_files/1984YESP.html Cash Box Year-End Charts: Top 100 Pop Singles, December 29, 1984 60 ==Personnel== * Lead Vocals, All Instruments (except as noted below) – Dan Hartman * Bass – Eddie Watkins * Acoustic Piano – Billy Payne * Oberheim DMX – Art Wood * Additional Guitar – Richie Zito * Percussion – Bobbye Hall * Backing Vocals – Dan Hartman, Joe Pizzulo, Winston Ford * Producers – Dan Hartman, Jimmy Iovine * Recording Engineer – Dan Hartman * Additional Recording Engineer – Shelly Yakus * Assistant Mixing Engineer – Steve Krause * Mastering – Steve Marcussen * Mixing on "I Can Dream About You" – Humberto Gatica * Additional Engineer on "I Can Dream About You" – Gabe Veltri * Management – Robert A.

25142650	I Corrupt All Cops	I Corrupt All Cops ( is a 2009 Hong Kong crime drama film directed by Wong Jing. The English initials of the film spells out ICAC. ==Plot== During the time Hong Kong was under British rule, there was a dark age when corruption and bribery were the order of the day. Chinese Chief Inspector Lak (Tony Leung Ka-fai) together with his gang, Unicorn (Anthony Wong), Gale (Eason Chan) and Gold (Wong Jing) laundered massive sums thereby making Hong Kong an empire of graft. Whenever they failed to apprehend the felons, Unicorn would get innocent victims, like Bong (Alex Fong), to admit to the crimes. Gale had nine "wives", all of whom were actually mistresses of other constables. Only Lily (Kate Tsui) was loyal to him, but Gale was fascinated by the female drug lord, Rose (Liu Yang). Lak was found having an affair with Unicorn's mistress (Natalie Meng Yao). Unicorn beat up Lak and was demoted to stand guard at a reservoir. In the early 1970s, the Governor of Hong Kong decided to clean up the police force. The ICAC was established, whose operation branch was headed by Yim (Bowie Lam). Bong and Unicorn also joined the ICAC. Despite threats of violence and intimidation, they managed to bring about the downfall of the empire of graft. ==Cast== * Tony Leung Ka-fai - Chief Inspector Lak Chui * Anthony Wong - Unicorn Tang * Eason Chan - Gale Chan * Bowie Lam - Inspector Yim * Alex Fong - Bong * Wong Jing - Gold * Kate Tsui - Lily * Kong Lin - Lak Chui's wife * Natalie Meng Yao - Unicorn's mistress * Liu Yang - Rose * Paw Hee-Ching - Bong's mother * Timmy Hung - Pastry * Samuel Leung - Fai * Simon Waikiss - Donald * Alan Chui Chung-San - Limp * Mars - Det.

25346929	I Am Not a Robot	"I Am Not a Robot" is a song by Welsh singer Marina Diamandis, released under the stage name Marina and the Diamonds, from her debut studio album, The Family Jewels (2010). It was released digitally on 23 April 2010 and physically on 26 April 2010 as the album's third single. The track originally appeared on Diamandis's second extended play, The Crown Jewels EP (2009). The single was added to BBC Radio 1's A List in April 2010. A choral version of "I Am Not a Robot" was used in an advertisement for British healthcare provider Bupa in March 2011. Additionally, the song was heavily sampled by American rapper Hoodie Allen for his debut single "You Are Not a Robot" (2010). ==Background and composition== "I Am Not a Robot" is a pop, avant-garde, and glam pop song. In an interview with Wales Online, Diamandis stated, "['I Am Not a Robot'] was me singing to myself. It's me saying, stop being so ridiculous, you can't let having a fear of failing hold you back and you're just one person. It's connected with a lot of people. I knew that would happen when I was writing it. I had a funny feeling." Diamandis said that she decided to release "I Am Not a Robot" as a single because "people seem to empathize and relate with the song, regardless of gender or age." ==Commercial performance== "I Am Not a Robot" debuted at number 74 on the UK Singles Chart, reaching its peak position of number 26 two weeks later. In total, the single spent seven weeks on the chart. As of February 2019, the song had sold 132,000 units in the United Kingdom. On 3 April 2019, "I Am Not a Robot" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments in excess of 500,000 units. It was Diamandis's third single to achieve this feat, following "Primadonna" and "How to Be a Heartbreaker", which were both certified gold on 15 May 2017. ==Critical reception== Gareth James from Clash named "I Am Not a Robot" "one of 2010's best singles", calling it "an infectious pop track featuring a unique vocal with more fluctuations than Florence sat on a washing machine." Alexis Petridis from The Guardian commented that "the lovely delicacy of 'I Am Not a Robot's tune is easy to miss when there's a woman doing Dalek voices over the top of it. Such are the dangers of trying a little too hard." John Murphy from musicOMH praised the song saying it "shows a pleasing touch of vulnerability which works very well." Diamandis was also praised following a performance of the song on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge on 23 April 2010. ==Music video== left|thumb|Diamandis in the music video for "I Am Not a Robot" The music video for "I Am Not a Robot" was directed by Rankin & Chris Cottam and was released onto YouTube on 24 June 2009. The music video features Diamandis in five scenes: one with her covered in black oil and glitter, one made-up in black, green and pink body paint, one with diamond lips and eyelids, one with the green, pink, and black body paint smeared, and lastly just her as her normal self. Each sequence shows Diamandis in the centre of the screen with either a starry, grey, white or black background whilst singing to the camera. Diamandis explained in an interview on Scott Mills's BBC Radio 1 show that the black oil reacted to her skin and it took forty minutes to rub off. It also took her eighteen hours to get all of her make-up done for the video. An alternative version of the video was shot on Los Angeles' Hollywood Boulevard and released on 14 April 2010. The music video starts with an unfocused view of headlights on a road. It zooms out to show Diamandis with white painted hair, and a white dress with one feathered sleeve, on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Diamandis walks down the street while singing the song, and blurred-face bystanders around her make way, stare, or go their way. Near the end, the camera shows Diamandis's white heels and white paint on her legs. At the end, Diamandis laughs, the camera follows her, and reveals the camera crew and the window of a shop. ==Track listings== *UK CD"I Am Not a Robot" (UK CD single).

25346998	I	I, or i, is the ninth letter and the third vowel letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is i (pronounced ), plural ies.Brown & Kiddle (1870) The institutes of English grammar, p. 19. Ies is the plural of the English name of the letter; the plural of the letter itself is rendered I's, Is, i's, or is. ==History== Egyptian hieroglyph ꜥ Phoenician Yodh Etruscan I Greek Iota Latin I 45px 30px 25px 64px Latin I In the Phoenician alphabet, the letter may have originated in a hieroglyph for an arm that represented a voiced pharyngeal fricative () in Egyptian, but was reassigned to (as in English "yes") by Semites, because their word for "arm" began with that sound. This letter could also be used to represent , the close front unrounded vowel, mainly in foreign words. The Greeks adopted a form of this Phoenician yodh as their letter iota () to represent , the same as in the Old Italic alphabet. In Latin (as in Modern Greek), it was also used to represent and this use persists in the languages that descended from Latin. The modern letter 'j' originated as a variation of 'i', and both were used interchangeably for both the vowel and the consonant, coming to be differentiated only in the 16th century. The dot over the lowercase 'i' is sometimes called a tittle. In the Turkish alphabet, dotted and dotless I are considered separate letters, representing a front and back vowel, respectively, and both have uppercase ('I', 'İ') and lowercase ('ı', 'i') forms. ==Use in writing systems== ===English=== In Modern English spelling, represents several different sounds, either the diphthong ("long" ) as in kite, the short as in bill, or the sound in the last syllable of machine. The diphthong developed from Middle English through a series of vowel shifts. In the Great Vowel Shift, Middle English changed to Early Modern English , which later changed to and finally to the Modern English diphthong in General American and Received Pronunciation. Because the diphthong developed from a Middle English long vowel, it is called "long" in traditional English grammar. The letter is the fifth most common letter in the English language. The English first-person singular nominative pronoun is "I", pronounced and always written with a capital letter. This pattern arose for basically the same reason that lowercase acquired a dot: so it wouldn't get lost in manuscripts before the age of printing: ===Other languages=== thumb|Pronunciation of the name of the letter in European languages|305x305px|left In many languages' orthographies, is used to represent the sound or, more rarely, . Language Pronunciation in IPA Notes Esperanto See Esperanto orthography. French See French orthography. German , , See German orthography. Italian Pronounced as long in stressed and open syllables, when in a closed stressed syllable or unstressed. See Italian orthography. Kurmanji represented with Portuguese /i/ See Portuguese orthography. ==Other uses== The Roman numeral I represents the number 1. In mathematics, a lowercase "" is used to represent the unit imaginary number, while an uppercase "" serves to denote an identity matrix. ==Forms and variants== In some sans serif typefaces, the uppercase letter I, 'I' may be difficult to distinguish from the lowercase letter L, 'l', the vertical bar character '|', or the digit one '1'. In serifed typefaces, the capital form of the letter has both a baseline and a cap height serif, while the lowercase L generally has a hooked ascender and a baseline serif. The uppercase I does not have a dot (tittle) while the lowercase i has one in most Latin-derived alphabets. However, some schemes, such as the Turkish alphabet, have two kinds of I: dotted (İi) and dotless (Iı). The uppercase I has two kinds of shapes, with serifs (x15px) and without serifs (x15px). Usually these are considered equivalent, but they are distinguished in some extended Latin alphabet systems, such as the 1978 version of the African reference alphabet. In that system, the former is the uppercase counterpart of ɪ and the latter is the counterpart of 'i'. ==Computing codes== : 1Also for encodings based on ASCII, including the DOS, Windows, ISO-8859 and Macintosh families of encodings. ==Other representations== ==Related characters== ===Descendants and related characters in the Latin alphabet=== *I with diacritics: Ị ị Ĭ ĭ Î î Ǐ ǐ Ɨ ɨ Ï ï Ḯ ḯ Í í Ì ì Ȉ ȉ Į į Į́ Į̃ Ī ī Ī̀ ī̀ ᶖ Ỉ ỉ Ȋ ȋ Ĩ ĩ Ḭ ḭ ᶤ *İ i and I ı : Latin letters dotted and dotless I *IPA-specific symbols related to I: *The Uralic Phonetic Alphabet uses various forms of the letter I: ** ** ** ** *Other variations used in phonetic transcription: ᵻ ᶤ ᶦ ᶧ 𝼚 *i : Superscript small i is used for computer terminal graphics *Ꞽ ꞽ : Glottal I, used for Egyptological yod *Ɪ ɪ : Small capital I *ꟾ : Long I *ꟷ : Sideways I ===Ancestors and siblings in other alphabets=== * : Semitic letter Yodh, from which the following symbols originally derive **Ι ι: Greek letter Iota, from which the following letters derive *** : Coptic letter Yota ***І і : Cyrillic letter soft-dotted I ***𐌉 : Old Italic I, which is the ancestor of modern Latin I **** : Runic letter isaz, which probably derives from old Italic I *** : Gothic letter iiz ==See also== * Tittle ==References== ==External links== * * Category:ISO basic Latin letters Category:Vowel letters

25392992	I Am (2010 Indian film)	I Am is a 2010 Indian Hindi-language anthology film by Onir. It consists of four short films: "Omar", "Afia", "Abhimanyu", and "Megha". Each film shares the common theme of fear, and each film is based on real-life stories. The film was financed by donations from more than 400 different people around the world, many of whom donated through social networking sites like Facebook. There are four stories but the characters are interwoven with each story. "Abhimanyu" is based on child abuse, "Omar" on gay rights, "Megha" is about Kashmiri Pandits and "Afia" deals with sperm donation. I Am was released with subtitles in all regions as six different languages are spoken in the film: Hindi, English, Kannada, Marathi, Bengali and Kashmiri. ==Plot== Each film shares the common theme of fear, and each film is based on real-life stories. They are - *"Afia" - A single woman Afiaa (Nandita Das) decides to become a mother using a sperm donor. She is a web designer by profession. She had been pushing her husband Manav (Manav Kaul) for a child but Manav leaves her because he loves some other girl. She then decides to have a kid on her own, through a test tube baby. She visits a Doctor Basu's (Anurag Basu) clinic and asks the doctor to provide her more details of the Donor. She meets Suraj (Purab Kohli) and asks him few questions wherein Suraj feels awkward. Later, she goes ahead with the sperm donation and test tube baby and offers Suraj some reward as thank you gift. Suraj politely declines but hands her over his phone number. In last scene, they show a smiling Afiaa tearing the note on which Suraj's phone number was written. *"Megha" - Almost 20 years after leaving Kashmir, Kashmiri Pandit Megha (Juhi Chawla) returns home on a business trip to find her childhood Muslim friend Rubina (Manisha Koirala) has suffered too. "Megha" is inspired by Sanjay Suri's real life experiences in Kashmir. *"Abhimanyu" - Abhimanyu (Sanjay Suri), a successful director, is haunted by memories of sexual abuse as a child. He must deal with his dark memories even as he struggles with his sexual identity. "Abhimanyu" is based on the experiences of fashion designer Ganesh Nallari and gay rights activist Harish Iyer. *"Omar" - Jay Gowda, from Bangalore, (Rahul Bose) meets Omar, a struggling actor in Mumbai, (Arjun Mathur). They flirt and have dinner together and then have sex at a public place. A policeman (Abhimanyu Singh) comes and manhandles them both and threatens Jay to turn him in under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and blackmails into giving 100,000 Rupees as bribe. Omar goes with Jay's ATM card to draw money, meanwhile the policeman rapes Jay. Omar returns with 50,000 Rupees, which the policeman takes along with both Jay and Omar's cellphones. Then he takes Omar along with him against protests of Jay (A hint of the policeman intenting to rape Omar). Later on Jay meets Omar again in a hotel and tell him that later that night, Jay had gone and woke up a big lawyer and went with him to the police station to get Omar released only to find that Omar was never there and then he realized that Omar was a part of setup to extort money from Jay. "Omar" is inspired by stories and research material provided by the online portal Gay Bombay. ==Cast== === Afia === * Nandita Das as Afiaa Kidwai * Purab Kohli as Suraj * Anurag Basu as Doctor Basu * Manav Kaul as Manav in a special appearance === Megha === * Juhi Chawla as Megha * Manisha Koirala as Rubina * Rushad Rana as Rubina's brother * Madhu Sagar as Ami (Rubina's mother) * Behram Rana as Abu (Rubina's father) * Faisal Burza as the lawyer * Fayeem Shah as Rubina's cousin * Mushtaq Kak as Beig Shab (shop keeper) === Abhimanyu === * Sanjay Suri as Abhimanyu “Abhi” * Radhika Apte as Natasha/Nats * Shernaz Patel as Asha (mother) * Anurag Kashyap as Vinay (step-father) * Pooja Gandhi as Aparna === Omar === * Rahul Bose as Jay Gowda * Arjun Mathur as Omar * Abhimanyu Singh as Policeman ==Production== thumb|right|150px|Artists on the set of the film in 2010. Onir first developed an idea for a short film while in Berlin, Germany. He later decided to make four shorts as he had too many ideas to fit into only one film. "Abhinmanyu" was originally written as a full-length film starring Karisma Kapoor in her comeback, but after she pulled out Onir changed the main character to a male and turned it into a short film. The shorts were shot on location in Srinagar ("Megha"), Mumbai ("Omar"), Bangalore ("Abhimanyu") and Kolkata ("Afia"). The "Afia" segment was originally intended to explore corruption in NGOs, but Onir decided to focus on sperm donation instead. During location shooting in Srinagar for the "Megha" segment, the crew was attacked by rocks and received terror threats and had to shift to Karan Nagar. Onir returned later under the guise of a documentary filmmaker to capture additional footage. === Sponsorships through social media === Onir raised financing from not only the film's stars, but also from members of the general public from around the world. Using Twitter and Facebook, Onir offered backers co-production credit in the film and a share in the profits. People who donated more than Rs. 100,000 became co-producers with a share in profits while those who contributed less than Rs. 100,000 received a mention in the credits. People have sent their contributions from Austria, the US, Nigeria and Australia. I Am is the first mainstream Hindi film that is crowd-sourced through social networking sites. Over 400 people from 45 cities across the world made this film happen by volunteering or contributing financially. === Celebrity contribution === Many of the participants in the film worked for free; Juhi Chawla, Manisha Koirala and Anurag Kashyap did not draw salaries and Manish Malhotra designed the film's costumes for free. Fashion designers like Manish Arora and Aki Narula have made costumes available for free, while actors and his friends Juhi Chawla and Sanjay Suri, and director Anurag Kashyap have supported him with ideas. Juhi Chawla and Purab Kohli also financially contributed to the stories in the movie. ==Release== I Am had its world premiere at the I View Film Festival in New York City. It screened at several other film festivals like the International Film Festival of Kerala and the Vancouver International Film Festival. I Am was originally scheduled for theatrical release in India and Australia on 22 April 2011, but Onir changed it to 29 April. To promote the release of the film, Onir has started a script writing contest where the authors of the 10 best scripts will win a meeting with him to pitch their screenplays. I Am will have a staggered release internationally beginning in New Zealand, and then moving to the US, Canada and Europe. ===Home media=== The DVD of I Am released on 31 May. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== I Am received mainly positive reviews from critics.

Taran Adarsh gave the film three and a half stars and named it "a motion picture of major significance" and "a landmark film". Rajeev Masand praised I Am for "fine performances and its inherent honesty". Critics particularly praised Abhimanyu Singh and Nandita Das for their performances. On the other hand, Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters called I Am "painfully rehearsed" and "oversimplified". ===Box office=== In its opening weekend I Am released on 67 screens in India and 7 in Australia, but failed to make an impact at the box office. It was fourth in overall weekend collections, ranking ahead of only Zokkomon. The Times of India blamed the poor collections on the film's depiction of social issues, saying it was "restricted only to discerning audience". ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack for I Am was released on 8 April 2011 on Sony Music. The songs are composed by Amit Trivedi, Rajiv Bhalla and Vivek Phillip with lyrics by Amitabh Verma and Amitabh Bhattacharya. ==Accolades== In 2012 I Am won the National Award for Best Hindi Film and Best Lyrics.

It first went on general release in Italy in March 2010, followed by the UK and Ireland in April 2010. In the United States it had only a limited release in June 2010, before being released on DVD in October 2010.IMDb: I Am Love - release dates Retrieved 6 January 2013 The film received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design at the 83rd Academy Awards. == Inspiration == Aside from a few minor differences, the Recchi family are largely based on the aristocratic Castellini Baldissera family, whose properties and ancestral homes were used as the set for the film. Piero Castellini Baldissera appears in a cameo role multiple times throughout the film == Plot== The wealthy Recchi family are first and second-generation textile manufacturers in Milan. Tancredi Recchi (Pippo Delbono) and his wife Emma (Swinton) are hosting a formal dinner party for Tancredi's ailing but still-formidable father, Edoardo Sr. (Gabriele Ferzetti), patriarch and founder of the family business, who is celebrating his birthday. As the many servants bustle about, the family note with disappointment the news that Edoardo Jr. (Flavio Parenti), Tancredi and Emma's eldest son, lost a competition the day of his grandfather's birthday. Edoardo Jr. arrives from that competition, having informed the family that he has invited a girlfriend. She is Eva, of the prominent Ugolini family, whom he plans to marry. Edoardo Jr.'s young adult siblings, Gianluca (Mattia Zaccaro) and Elisabetta (Alba Rohrwacher), complain of yet again being served "ukha", Edoardo Jr.'s favourite dish, a special soup his mother Emma, who is Russian by birth, has made for him since childhood. The grandfather announces he is passing the family business to his son, Tancredi, who has long worked with him, and also, unexpectedly, to Edoardo Jr. At the dinner, Elisabetta, who attends school in London, presents her grandfather with one of her artworks, a photograph, despite a tradition of presenting one another paintings. He is disappointed, but encouraged by his glamorous wife Allegra "Rori" Recchi (Marisa Berenson) to gloss over his disappointment. Later during the birthday celebration, Edoardo Jr. receives a surprise visit from Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), the chef who defeated him in the competition earlier that day. Antonio brings a beautiful cake as a gift, and Edoardo, flattered by the gesture, introduces him to his mother. After the party, while Emma is running errands, she discovers a CD, with a note from Elisabetta to her brother Edoardo revealing that Elisabetta is a lesbian. She tells her brother of an encounter with a woman and that she is in love with another woman. Meanwhile, Edoardo Jr. visits Antonio in Antonio's father's restaurant. They later make plans to open a restaurant together on some property Antonio's father owns in San Remo. Months later, Emma is having lunch at Antonio's restaurant with Rori and Eva, and she is aroused while relishing a prawn dish he prepares for her. Elisabetta returns to Milan, with her hair cut short, and invites Emma to go with her to Nice to look for a venue for Elisabetta's art exhibition. While stopping in San Remo en route to Nice to surprise her daughter, Emma spots Antonio, follows him, and eventually speaks to him outside of a book shop. She goes with him to his house in the hills above the city, and they begin their affair. Meanwhile, Edoardo Sr. has died, and in London, Edoardo Jr. struggles as his father and other family members seek to sell the family business they inherited from Edoardo Sr. to foreign investors. Edoardo Jr. visits his sister and tells her of the future of the business and his opposition to the sale. On her second trip to San Remo, under the pretext of discussing a menu for the formal dinner she will host for the foreign investors who are buying the Recchi family business, Emma spends the day with Antonio, and the two enjoy passionate lovemaking. Emma tells Antonio how Tancredi met her during a trip to Russia hunting for art treasures. Antonio cuts Emma's blonde hair, a long lock of which falls unnoticed to the terrace, where Edoardo Jr. finds it during his own visit after the London meeting. They cook together, and Emma teaches him to make ukha. On the night of the dinner at the Recchi villa for the investors, a conversation between Edoardo Jr. and Eva is overheard, revealing she is pregnant with his child. Antonio prepares ukha. When Edoardo sees this dish served, he instantly realizes his mother is having an affair with Antonio. He leaves the dinner table in a fury. Emma follows him outside to the garden and alongside the pool she tries to talk to him. In pulling away from Emma's outstretched hand, Edoardo loses his balance, falls, strikes his head on the edge of the pool's stone trim, and falls into the pool. He sustains a cerebral haemorrhage and dies in hospital. At the cemetery following the funeral, Tancredi tries to console Emma. She tells him that she is in love with Antonio. He responds by telling her "You don't exist." Emma rushes home and changes her clothes while her housekeeper helps her pack her things to leave. Before she leaves, she exchanges a knowing glance with her daughter, who it appears understands her mother's desire to follow her heart. Eva, who has hardly been noticed by Edoardo's family since his death, clutches her abdomen as she calls out to Eduardo Jr.'s siblings and grandmother, revealing her pregnancy. When the family members look back into the foyer where Emma was standing, she is gone. During the final credits, Emma and Antonio are seen lying together inside a cave. == Production == Many of the scenes were shot in the , a 1930s mansion in the heart of Milan designed by architect Piero Portaluppi. and currently owned by Fondo Ambiente Italiano, following a 2001 donation by Gigina Necchi Campiglio and Nedda Necchi. While the plot and characters of the film are fictitious, the surname of the family portrayed (Recchi) clearly echoes that of the entrepreneurial family (Necchi) which owned the mansion, mixing it with the name of coastal town Recco (hinting to the role played by Liguria in the film). Tilda Swinton said the villa was perfect because they were looking for a house “that was part palace, part museum, and part prison.” The funeral and the subsequent scene were filmed in the Cimitero Monumentale di Milano and notably in its distinctive "Famedio" (Hall of Fame). The soundtrack is made up entirely of pre-existing pieces by the modern classical composer John Adams. Swinton explained that the film was actually created around the pieces of music, and that they went to Adams after finishing the film and asked to use his music, which he had not allowed before. They were relieved when he liked the film and said yes.DVD commentary The film's title is taken from a line from the aria La mamma morta (from the opera Andrea Chénier by Umberto Giordano), which is explored in the film Philadelphia—a scene from which Swinton's character watches in bed with her husband. The food and meals in the film were inspired by the cuisine of Carlo Cracco, the owner of the Cracco Peck restaurant in Milan. == Cast == * Tilda Swinton as Emma Recchi * as Edoardo Recchi Jr. * Edoardo Gabbriellini as Antonio Biscaglia * Alba Rohrwacher as Elisabetta "Betta" Recchi * Pippo Delbono as Tancredi Recchi * as Ida Roselli * Diane Fleri as Eva Ugolini * Waris Ahluwalia as Shai Kubelkian * Marisa Berenson as Allegra Recchi, called Rori * Gabriele Ferzetti as Edoardo Recchi Sr. * Honor Swinton Byrne as Young Emma Recchi (non-speaking cameo) ==Reception== ===Critical response=== I Am Love was met with positive reviews. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 81% based on reviews from 136 critics, with an average score of 7.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "It stumbles into melodrama, but I Am Love backs up its flamboyance with tremendous visual style and a marvelous central performance from Tilda Swinton." Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a "generally favorable" score of 79 based on 32 reviews. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, praising Swinton's performance and saying "I Am Love is an amazing film. It is deep, rich, human. It is not about rich and poor, but about old and new. It is about the ancient war between tradition and feeling." The Washington Posts Ann Hornaday said the film was "carefully composed and framed, gorgeously appointed, superbly choreographed and accompanied by a thrilling musical score, it would no doubt provide rewarding fodder for critics of art, design, fashion, dance and music." Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, saying "It's a high-IQ picture – there are few enough of those – and it's fascinating, if a little bloodless. A gorgeously costumed and styled piece of work." Margaret Pomeranz of At the Movies gave the film four and a half out of five stars and said "This is a beautiful film, moving, stylish with a sensual romance at its heart." Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times praised Swinton's performance, saying "Swinton is one of the finest actresses working in contemporary cinema, but Guadagnino, who developed the project with her in mind, has created a film that literally luxuriates in her talents." Empires Damon Wise gave the film four out of five stars and said "Though it drags a little, this stately film never descends into formula, using John Adams' score to great effect and boldly utilising the flourishes of '70s Italian genre cinema (zooms, handheld camera) to create something original, refreshing and really very moving." Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a grade of "C+", saying "O sexytime in the countryside! O many wardrobe changes! The film is almost deliriously stylish, which helps mask the silliness. But the bellowing music, by John Adams, is infuriatingly intrusive – which undoes the visual good." Mark Demetrius of Filmink gave the film a negative review, stating "Despite an elegant and impressive visual style, the narrative of this slow-paced film is uninteresting and full of cliché." New York Film Critics Online called the work the Best Foreign Film of 2010. Quentin Tarantino listed it as one of his favorite 20 films of 2010. ===Accolades=== The film was nominated at the 68th Golden Globe Awards for Best Foreign Film but lost out to Denmark's In a Better World. Costume designer Antonella Cannarozzi was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design for her work in the film, but the award went to Colleen Atwood for Alice in Wonderland. The film was also nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language, but lost to Niels Arden Oplev's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. ===Box office=== By March 2011, the film had grossed a total of USD$11,568,202 in cinemas worldwide. Home entertainment and TV sales are not included in the totals. ==References== == External links == * * * * * Category:2009 films Category:2009 romantic drama films Category:2009 LGBT-related films Category:2000s Italian-language films Category:Italian LGBT-related films Category:Italian romantic drama films Category:Lesbian-related films Category:LGBT-related romantic drama films Category:Films about the upper class Category:Films set in Milan Category:Films shot in Italy Category:Films directed by Luca Guadagnino

2554661	I Am Me	I Am Me is the second studio album by American recording artist Ashlee Simpson. It was released in the United States on October 18, 2005 (see 2005 in music) and debuted at number one in sales. The album produced two top 25 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, "Boyfriend" and "L.O.V.E." Simpson worked with John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi on this album, as she did on her first album, 2004's Autobiography. Shanks produced the album, and Simpson co-wrote all the songs with Shanks and DioGuardi.Geffen press release, "Ashlee Simpson's New Single 'Boyfriend' Now Radio's Best Friend Makes Fast Rise on U.S. Playlists" , PRNewswire, October 11, 2005. On December 15, I Am Me was certified Platinum by the RIAARIAA.com. for its shipments of over one million copies in the U.S. (as of April 2008, it had sold 987,000 copies). A new single from Simpson, "Invisible", was reportedly going to be included on a re-release of I Am Me in mid-2006, but was canceled. The song was later included as an international bonus track on Simpson's next album, Bittersweet World. ==Background and production== I Am Me was released about fifteen months after Autobiography, which was released in July 2004. According to Simpson, following her concert tour from February to April 2005, she was supposed to take a month off, but began working on the album early;Alisha Davis, "Ashlee Simpson: Everybody Has Moments" , MTV.com. as she said, "I got home and got bored, so I called John Shanks and was like, 'Can I come in the studio? Let's get a head start so the record company's not asking for the record right away or anything."Gary Graff, "Ashlee Simpson puts woes of 'SNL' mishap on record", The Plain Dealer, October 20, 2005. She also said that she wanted to "get the pre-jitters or anything that was going wrong out of my system. And when I went in everything started going smooth. It was fun." According to Simpson, she felt less pressure when recording I Am Me than she did when recording Autobiography. I Am Me is, like its predecessor, a mixture of rock and pop; it has been described as similar to Simpson's first album,Jennifer Vineyard, "Ashlee Remembers SNL Incident But Forgets Boys On New LP", MTV News, August 8, 2005. Joe Simpson is quoted here as saying: "They're going to love this record because it's more of the same". and Simpson herself has said that she wanted it to be "familiar" to Autobiography. Some differences have also been noted. I Am Me has been said to be influenced by '80s music,Talia Kraines, BBC.co.uk review of I Am Me.Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [ Allmusic review of I Am Me]. and Simpson herself said "I just love '80s music" and "It's just so light and fun, and that was a lot of what I wanted to do on this record.""I 'Me' Mine", Billboard.com, October 16, 2005. Prior to recording I Am Me, Simpson had said she wanted to incorporate more of the feel of 17th century music into her next album, as some of her favorite music is from that time.Jennifer Vineyard, "Ashlee Simpson Going '80s, Getting Personal On Next Album", MTV News, March 25, 2005. I Am Me has been called more musically "aggressive" than Autobiography and incorporates a range of musical styles; it has been called "dynamic" and "ambitious". Simpson's father and manager Joe said that his daughter had to be held back from "the places she wanted to go" as an artist, because, he said, if she changed too quickly her fans would be left behind.Jonah Weiner, "Sister Act 2", Blender, December 2005, page 117. Simpson has mentioned how she tried "new sounds" when working on the album, citing in particular the song "Burnin Up",Larry King Live transcript, October 22, 2005. which was described by one reviewer as "a fairly credible stab at Clash-style dub".Mike Usinger, I Am Me review, Straight.com, November 10, 2005. This song is not a cover of the early Madonna song ("Burning Up") that Simpson covered live during her February–April 2005 tour.Josh Timmermann, review of I Am Me , Stylus, October 26, 2005. Lyrically, the album reflects Simpson's different life experiences since her last album; in particular, two songs deal with Simpson's emotions following her failed performance on Saturday Night Live in October 2004, in which she used a backing track due to illness, only to have the wrong track played, thus making the presence of the backing track obvious and embarrassing her on live television. This incident left Simpson the target of a great deal of criticism and humor at her expense. The first song on the album that deals with the incident is "Beautifully Broken", which strikes a positive tone of overcoming as Simpson finds beauty in failure--"the song is kind of about when you're in bed and you're crying and you don't want to get up the next day ... it's about finding that inner strength and finding that part in yourself that's like, 'Yes, I can put my head up and I can continue.'" "Catch Me When I Fall", the second song on the album dealing with the incident, is a piano-driven ballad which reflects weakness and sadness and deals with a feeling of loneliness. The theme of accepting imperfections is reflected in a hidden message that is included in the CD case.MuchOnDemand transcript , November 1, 2005. Simpson has said of the album: "The record is dark meets light in a sense. I feel everyone has a dark side. This album is about finding the positive, finding the lighter side as well." Simpson mentioned in an AIM interview online that she chose the title I Am Me "because I've been through a lot of highs and lows this year, but no matter what happens to me I always stay true to who I am."AIM chat with Ashlee Simpson, November 2005. Simpson has also mentioned how the lyrics on the album reflect her different feelings at different times, the ups and downs she experienced: "We all get sad sometimes, and we all want to dance and party, too." Like Autobiography, many of the songs deal with relationships. "Coming Back For More" is, as Simpson calls it, a "fun, dancey song about an ex-boyfriend" and their relationship that won't come to an end. "I Am Me" is an energetic song in which Simpson responds with hurt and anger to her boyfriend being with another girl, and insists: "I am me, and I won't change for anyone". "In Another Life" is, in Simpson's words, "a cute romantic song about when you meet a guy and it's kind of like he knows everything about you before you really get to know him, and you feel comfortable with him right away. And he makes you feel beautiful." "Say Goodbye", the melancholy album closer, deals with the ending of a relationship. Other songs cover a variety of topics: "Boyfriend" is a response to rumors or accusations that she stole another girl's boyfriend (although rumors suggest it is about her alleged affair with Lindsay Lohan's ex-boyfriend, Wilmer Valderrama, Simpson has said it is not about "one person in particular", but is instead about a situation many girls can relate toCorey Moss, "Ashlee Says New Single Isn't Directed At Lindsay Lohan", MTV News, August 15, 2005.); "L.O.V.E." is about girls going out and having fun without needing any guys;Vineyard, "Ashlee Remembers SNL Incident But Forgets Boys On New LP", MTV News, August 8, 2005. "Eyes Wide Open" is a "spooky song" about Simpson's feeling that there was a ghost living in her house.Total Request Live television interview, October 18, 2005. In 2009, Miley Cyrus covered the international bonus track "Kicking and Screaming" for her The Time of Our Lives EP. Although Simpson co-wrote the song with Shanks and DioGuardi, Simpson was not credited for her writing contribution on Cyrus' EP. ==Promotion== Initially, the first single was planned to be "L.O.V.E.", and the album was going to be titled In Another Life. Soon after these things were announced, however, the first single was changed to "Boyfriend" and the album title to I Am Me. "Boyfriend" officially hit radio on September 6 and its airplay rapidly increased afterward; it debuted on the Hot 100 in September at number 71,Barry A.

It was subsequently stated in an article in the June/July 2006 issue of Teen People that there would be a re-release of the album with the new song "Invisible";Carrie Borzillo-Vrenna, "Teen People's Hottest 25 Stars Under Twenty-Five: Hot Survivor", Teen People, June/July 2006, page 143. Simpson also said this in interviews, but as of January 2007, no release date for the re-release had been announced and therefore the re-release plans were presumably dropped. Simpson filmed the music video for "Invisible" in May, and it premiered on June 19. ===Touring=== To promote the album and single, Simpson began touring on September 21 in Portland, Oregon,List of Ashlee Simpson tour dates, September–December 2005, top40.about.com. with another stage of the tour starting on November 9 in Portland, Maine with opening act October Fall.Gil Kaufman, "Ashlee Simpson Hits The Road", MTV.com, October 20, 2005.

Subsequently, she embarked on a major summer tour, the L.O.V.E.

Ashley Parker Angel was an opening act for Simpson;Geffen press release, "Ashlee Simpson Sets Summer 2006 Tour", PRNewswire.com, May 17, 2006. The Veronicas also opened on the first few shows of the tour, but had to cancel their participation in the tour due to a problem with the vocal cords of one of the singers, Lisa Origliasso.Sire Records press release, "The Veronicas' North American Summer Tour Cancelled", Marketwire.com, June 13, 2006. During the concerts of this tour, Simpson had a number of costume changes, including a "risque" outfit for "La La", and performed a cover of the Eurythmics song "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)".E! News, "Backstage Exclusive" interview of Simpson by Ryan Seacrest, aired June 8, 2006. She also performed a cover of "Why Don't You Do Right?".Jay Lustig, "Ashlee throws everything but the sync into high-energy show", The Star- Ledger, July 22, 2006. ==Critical reception== Initial critical response to I Am Me was mixed to negative. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 43, based on 13 reviews. A BBC review of the album was positive, calling it "confident yet searching" and saying that it "flirts with 80s production throughout and produces a more mature, tighter sound than some of her peers." Stylus also gave it a favorable review; while saying that it "isn't as consistently strong a record as Autobiography", it calls I Am Me "more-than-respectable" and "a very good record". Another review called it "a solid pop/rock album" with strong songwriting that "should go far to re- establish Ashlee Simpson as a legitimate artist", giving it three-and-a-half stars (out of five).Bill Lamb, I Am Me review, top40.about.com. Rolling Stone gave it a negative review, rating it slightly lower than it had previously rated Autobiography: I Am Me received one-and-a-half stars, while Autobiography received two (out of five). The Rolling Stone review called the album "a collection of eleven soulless tunes that fail to even qualify as guilty pleasures" and said that "in venturing to offer something for everyone, Simpson offers nothing for anyone." Allmusic also gave the album a negative assessment (and a rating of two stars out of five), saying that "unlike Autobiography, this simply is no rock & roll fun — the songs aren't catchy, the attitude is dour, the productions are cold and distant, all highlighting the deficiencies in Ashlee Simpson as a singer, while burying the likeable persona she had on both her debut and her MTV show."Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [ Allmusic review]. Blender said that, in comparison to Autobiography, "the songs are soggier, the sentiments more banal", and calls I Am Me a "sophomore slump", giving it two out of five stars.Dennis Lim, "Sync or Swim", Blender, December 2005, page 154. Another review called the album "solid but unspectacular", crediting Simpson with going "in directions that Avril Lavigne has never thought of" but wishing that Simpson displayed more "obnoxious grit" on the album. ==Commercial performance== I Am Me debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, as did its predecessor, Autobiography; however, I Am Me did not achieve the same level of success as Autobiography. Whereas Simpson's first album sold 398,000 copies its first week of release in the U.S., I Am Me sold only about 220,000, according to Billboard;Margo Whitmire, "Simpson Strikes Back: Ashlee Scores 2nd No. 1", Billboard.com, October 26, 2005. sales for the album declined 67% in its second week, when it sold about 73,000 copies and fell to number six on the Billboard 200.Chris Harris, "Destiny's Child's #1's Hits — You Guessed It — #1", MTV News, November 11, 2005. In its third week, the album sold about 54,000 copies, a sales drop of 25%, and it fell on the chart to number ten.Margo Whitmire, "'NOW 20' Cruises To No. 1 Debut", Billboard.com, November 9, 2005. Rolling Stone magazine grouped it among the numerous "heavily anticipated albums" of the season whose sales had "fizzled", such as Alicia Keys' Unplugged and Rod Stewart's Thanks for the Memory: The Great American Songbook 4, which had been released the same week as I Am Me.Steve Knopper, "Kanye Couldn't Save Fall". Rolling Stone, November 15, 2005. As of April 2008, I Am Me has sold 944,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan. In Australia, I Am Me debuted at number 35 without a single being lifted from it before its release. "Boyfriend" was released the week after I Am Me was released. However, I Am Me failed to chart again after its debut and dropped out completely. In the United Kingdom, in the absence of any promotion, I Am Me debuted at #160, selling just 1,392 copies in its first week. However, in late January 2006, Simpson went to the UK to promote "Boyfriend", several months later than in the U.S.; the single was released in the UK on 30 January 2006, and hit #12 in its first week;Paul Sexton, "Monkeys, B.I.G. Remain Atop U.K. Charts", Billboard.com, February 6, 2006. also, the album climbed to #50 in the UK in mid-February 2006. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from the I Am Me liner notes.I Am Me liner notes. ===Musicians=== * Ashlee Simpson – vocals, background vocals (4, 7) * John Shanks – guitars (all tracks), bass (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14), keyboards (1, 2, 4-14), piano (3), background vocals (2, 3, 7, 9 and 11) * Kara DioGuardi – background vocals (4 and 7) * Jeff Rothschild – drums (all tracks) * Dan Chase – additional keyboards (1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 13 and 14) * Patrick Warren – keyboards (3 and 8) * André Bowman – bass, keyboards (4) * Mike Elizondo – bass (4, 5 and 8) * Paul Bushnell – bass (11) ===Production=== *John Shanks – producer, mixing * Jordan Schur – executive producer, A&R; * Joe Simpson – executive producer *Jeff Rothschild – mixing, engineering * Ted Jensen – mastering * James White – photography * Bubbles – design * Jessica Paster – stylist * Ken Paves – hair * AYAKO – make-up ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2005) Peak position Australian Albums (ARIA) 35 Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria) 60 Canadian Albums (Billboard) 4 Japanese Albums (Oricon) 13 UK Albums (OCC) 50 US Billboard 200 1 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2005) Position US Billboard 200 171 Chart (2006) Position US Billboard 200 126 ==Certifications== ==Release history== Release dates and formats for I Am Me Region Date Format Label Canada October 18, 2005 CD Universal United States Geffen Japan October 19, 2005 Universal Australia October 30, 2005 United Kingdom October 31, 2005 Germany April 21, 2006 Japan September 27, 2006 ==References== ==External links== * Ashlee Simpson's official website * Ashlee Simpson at Geffen Records * Category:2005 albums Category:Albums produced by John Shanks Category:Ashlee Simpson albums Category:Geffen Records albums
25566142	I Am 13	I Am 13 Years Old () is a 1980 play by Merle Karusoo. This is the first of a series of plays representing Karusoo's 'memory theatre' based on documentary material. The drama, set in deep Soviet occupation era of Estonia, was developed by integrating a number of essays collected from 13-year-old schoolchildren of the era, and developed into a coherent, yet comprehensive plot depicting everyday life and culture of 1980s early teenagers. It was staged by Karusoo 1980 in the State Youth Theatre of the Estonian SSR. The text was born in course of repetitions. It was played at Klooga rand, a beach outside of Tallinn. == Foreshadowing == The generation depicted — people born in late 1960s — were the last generation spending their youth in occupied Estonia, and the first generation to shape the post-occupation culture, life and eventually, policy. While most of the superficial trappings have been forgotten, changed or become memorables, several attitudes illustrated in the play are recognisable in Estonian public life of late 20th and early 21st century. == Common presentation == The play is best known as presented by Andrus Vaarik, Guido Kangur and in the primary roles, and originally written with these actors in mind. (The primary roles, Andrus, Guido and Toomas, are named after them.) However, as a technically simple drama of strong recognition by teenagers of later decades, it, or episodes from it, has been presented by numerous non-notable school theatre projects. ==Awards== As the director, Merle Karusoo was awarded by the award of the Theatre Union of the Estonian SSR (1980). The troupe got the collective special award of the Theatre Union. In 1981, Merle Karusoo was awarded by the Literary Award of the Estonian SSR for the play. In 1988, Andrus Vaarik was awarded by the for his roles, including the role in this play. ==Sources== * Olen 13-aastane == Further reading == * Merle Karusoo 1989: Olen kolmeteistkümne aastane.

25609512	I Ain't Been Shot Mum!	I Ain't Been Shot Mum! (abbreviated as IABSM) is a World War II tabletop skirmish miniatures wargame produced by Too Fat Lardies. Designers Richard Clarke and Nick Skinner started work on a set of rules for the Vietnam war. Feeling that the existing rulesets allowed too much control over their forces they set out to design a set of rules that would force a player to think as a real-life commander rather than a gamer. As such, IABSM has been heavily influenced by the Kriegsspiel approach, usually (but not always) utilizing an umpire to help decide points of issue that arise during the game such as modifiers for shooting, spotting enemies, etc. The rules are designed to force players to adopt realistic tactics, including scouting ahead for hidden enemies as the game system uses "blinds" to simulate the fog of war. The main focus is not on military hardware but on the men using that hardware, and on morale and command and control. Rather than giving the player total control over their forces every action, the system uses so-called "Big Men" to allow players to influence their forces behaviour. It also features a random, card- driven initiative system rather than the classic I-GO-U-GO system most turn- based strategy games use. A typical company will have a card for each platoon and a card for each Big Man (officers and NCOs). The actions of squads/sections are keyed to the platoon and Big Man cards. This initiative system is designed to simulate the "friction" of war noted by Carl von Clausewitz, plus units use a dice system for movement, observation, and fire that means you never know exactly how they will perform. The basic IABSM system provides a framework allowing players to tailor the game to specific situations or conflicts. Apart from its main focus on World War II, it has been adapted to the Spanish Civil War, the Falklands War and the Korean War. The rules are designed for Company level games, i.e. where each side fields roughly a reinforced company of troops at 1 man to 1 figure scale, with infantry combat being at the heart of the rules, but also including a comprehensive mechanism for armour support, artillery, etc. The rules have been designed for 15 mm scale figures, but can be easily adopted for other scales such as 6 mm or 25 mm. The system does not use a point-based method for constructing opposing forces, so most games are designed to be scenario driven. == The Kriegsspiel approach == One of the main characteristics of IABSM is that many common and somehow simple decisions are left to the players, effectively providing a "framework for play"Unknown,"Review: I Ain't Been Shot Mum!", The Wargame Shed, November 2006 rather than a checklist to represent real situations on the model battlefield. The challenges and possibilities of this approach are endless, since shooting at a target behind some cover would require both players (or the umpire) to agree on the shot being Great, Ok or Poor. But this freedom also allows for any non predictable action to take place, like heroic feats, based in the same common agreement. == Rules and Sourcebooks == The main rules of versions 1 and 2 did not contain any information about the armies involved. However version 3, published in Summer 2012 contains 'The Normandy Handbook', to cover the campaign in France following Operation Overlord, and contains basic lists for US, British and German forces, as well as four historically inspired scenarios, and six generic 'scenario generator' templates. The armies are described in more detail in various supplements. The following supplements were written for IABSM v1 and v2 (see further down for details of the v3 supplements): * Blitzkrieg :Covers the period between 1939 and 1943. :Army information for Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Holland, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. * Götterdammerung :Covers the period between 1943 and 1945. :Army information for Brazil, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Romania, the Soviet Union and the United States. * In the Footsteps of Legions :Covers the war in the Mediterranean and North Africa. :Army information for British Empire and Dominion forces, Free French, Vichy France, Germany, Greece, Iraq, Italy, United States and Yugoslavia. * In The Shadow of the Rising Sun :Covers the war in the Pacific. :Army information for Australia, China, Holland, Vichy France, Great Britain, Japan, Thailand and the United States. == Scenarios == As well as supplements detailing various armed forces, Too Fat Lardies also publishes scenario supplements for use with IABSM. The supplements contain historical background, maps, mission briefings and participating forces. As the forces involved are described as real world equivalents rather than point values, conversion to different rulesets is relatively easy. Nearly all the scenario packs are available adapted or written for IABSM v3. Scenario/campaign packs published so far are: * Western Front :The Defence of Calais (historical) :The Campaign for Greece (historical) :Operation Sea Lion (fictional) :Anzio: Wildcat to Whale (historical) :Where the Hell Have You Been Boys (historical - D-Day) :Blenneville or Bust! (fictional - Normandy) * Eastern Front :The September War, Part 1 (historical - Poland 1939) :The September War, Part 2 (historical - Poland 1939) :Vyazma or Bust (fictional) :Bashnya or Bust (fictional - Operation Bagration) * Pacific/Far East :Fall of the Lion Gate (historical - Fall of Malaya/Singapore) :Bloody Burma (historical - Fall of Burma) * Africa :Call this a Ruddy Picnic? (historical - East Africa) :Operation Compass (historical) * Others :Cymru am byth (historical - rather than detailing a specific operation or campaign, this supplement follows the actions of one regiment during the course of the war.) Also, some free scenarios has been published in the Scenario of the Month section of the Too Fat Lardies webpage. ==3rd edition supplements== For the 3rd edition, the following specific supplements have been written: *Blitzkrieg in the East #1: Poland :Covers the invasion of Poland in September 1939 :Army information on Polish, German and Soviet forces :Currently available as a free download from the Too Fat Lardies website *Blitzkrieg in the West #1: France :Covers the French army of May 1940 *Blitzkrieg in the West #2: The BEF :Covers the British Expeditionary Force of May 1940 *Blitzkrieg in the West #3: The Low Countries :Covers the Dutch and Belgian armies of May 1940 *Blitzkrieg in the West #4: Germany :Covers the German army in May 1940 *Blitzkrieg in the Far East #1: Japan :Covers the Japanese army between December 1941 and July 1942 :Also includes substantial campaign information * Battle For Liberation :Covers the Western Front during the period 1943 to 1945 :Army information for British & Commonwealth [sic], United States, French, German and Italian forces. * Vpered Na Berlin :Covers the Eastern Front during the period 1943 to 1945 :Army information for German, Romanian, Hungarian, Finnish, Yugoslavian and Soviet forces Earlier supplements are usable, however crosschecking of statistics with the 'Normandy Handbook' is advisable, as some values have changed, most notably 'Strike' values for Tank/Anti-tank guns. ==References== ==External links== * Too Fat Lardies website Reviews: * Independent review on Boardgame Geek. * Independent review on RPG.net. * Independent review on The Wargame Shed. * A totally biased, in their own words, review from the Durham Wargames Group.

25670024	I Always Get Lucky with You	"I Always Get Lucky With You" is a song written by Merle Haggard, Freddy Powers, Gary Church, and Tex Whitson. It was first recorded by Haggard on his 1981 album Big City and then covered by American country music artist George Jones in April 1983 as the second single from the album Shine On. The song was Jones' ninth and final number one on the country chart as a solo artist . The single stayed at number one for one week and spent thirteen weeks on the country chart. == Background == Co-writer Merle Haggard recorded the song first on his 1981 hit LP Big City but did not release it as a single. According to the Stephen L. Betts Rolling Stone article "George Jones Gets 'Lucky' with Merle Haggard Song" published online on February 13, 2015, Haggard's manager, Tex Whitson, first pitched it to Jones' producer Billy Sherrill because Jones and Haggard were on the outs at the time. "I'd get mad at him over the years because of his self-damage, but everything I said to him was out of love," Haggard wrote in an article for Rolling Stone after his friend died. "Imagine you're George Jones, and every night you're expected to sing as good as you did on a song like 'She Thinks I Still Care.' He was a shy country boy from East Texas walking around with that on his shoulders. He knew people expected him to be the greatest country singer that ever lived. He was the Babe Ruth of country music, and people expected a home run every time." Sherrill, who had produced Jones and Haggard on their first duet album together A Taste of Yesterday's Wine the year before, still possessed his instincts for a great song and persuaded Jones to cut it. In the 1994 video retrospective Golden Hits, Jones recalled that he "sung it around Nashville at some of the clubs to try and get used to it before I went into the studio and it came off great. It's a great song. Merle Haggard wrote a good one there." Jones, who was about to hit rock bottom after spending most of the previous decade in a booze and drug-crazed wasteland, delivered a sterling performance, which became the last chart topper of his career, ironically bumping off "Pancho and Lefty," Haggard's hit duet with Willie Nelson. Haggard would record the song again in 2006 as part of the second Jones/Haggard release Kickin' Out the Footlights...Again. A duet version featuring Jones and Shelby Lynne was made available on the 2009 Jones LP Burn Your Playhouse Down – The Unreleased Duets. == Charts == === Weekly charts === Chart (1983) Peak position Canadian RPM Country Tracks 6 === Year-end charts === Chart (1983) Position US Hot Country Songs (Billboard) 11 == References == Category:1981 songs Category:1983 singles Category:Merle Haggard songs Category:George Jones songs Category:Songs written by Merle Haggard Category:Songs written by Freddy Powers Category:Song recordings produced by Billy Sherrill Category:Epic Records singles
25700722	I Am the Cheese (film)	I Am the Cheese is a 1983 American film adaptation of Robert Cormier's 1977 novel of the same name, about a young man's journey to find the truth behind his family. The film was directed by Robert Jiras and filmed in Vermont. ==Plot== Fifteen year old Adam Farmer (Robert MacNaughton) seeks to unearth the many secrets locked in his subconscious. Adam's journey through his mind is paralleled with a bike trip to Rutterburg, Vermont, with a package for his father. As he travels through several small towns, he starts to remember past events from his life. Adam's trip is prompted by a call from his girlfriend, Amy (Cynthia Nixon), who says her father met a reporter from Adam's alleged hometown of Rawlings, Pennsylvania, and the reporter had never heard of anyone named Farmer living there. Suspicious, Adam begins spying on his parents and finds two birth certificates with his name on them, but with different birthdates - February 14 (Valentine's Day) and July 14 (Bastille Day). Adam confronts his father, who admits some shocking truths. Adam's real name is Paul Delmonte and the family was forced to relocate in a Witness Protection- type program after his father testified in state and federal trials against corrupt government officials. In reality, Adam is not biking to Vermont; he is riding in circles around the psychiatric facility where he has been held for the past three years, and the people he meets along the way are patients and workers at the facility. His "journey" is a quest to discover the whereabouts of his parents, who mysteriously disappeared (in truth, they were "terminated" by the adversaries they sought to elude). The memories Adam recounts are documented in "psychiatric sessions," which are, in fact, interviews to determine whether or not he knows more about his father's involvement with the government than he's telling. Adam's final interview ends with two possible outcomes, neither of which bode well for the boy: "Terminating" him or continuing to question him until he dies. ==Cast== * Robert MacNaughton as Paul Delmonte / Adam Farmer ** Frank McGurren as young Adam * Cynthia Nixon as Amy Hertz * Robert Wagner as Dr. Brint * Don Murray as Anthony Delmonte / David Farmer * Hope Lange as Betty Farmer * Lee Richardson as Mr. Grey * Robert Cormier as Mr. Hertz * John Fiedler as Arnold ==External links== * * * * ==References== Category:1983 films Category:1983 drama films Category:American drama films Category:Films based on American novels Category:American independent films Category:1983 independent films Category:Films about witness protection Category:1980s English-language films Category:1980s American films
2571541	I Can Do Bad All by Myself (play)	Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad All by Myself is a 1999 American stage play written, directed and produced by and starring Tyler Perry. The play marks for the first official appearance of the well-known fictional character Madea, who is portrayed by Perry. Although the original production wasn't recorded, the live performance that was released on DVD and VHS was recorded live in Washington, D.C. at the Lincoln Theatre in August 2002. ==DVD plot== ===Act One=== Vianne, who in the middle of settling a bitter divorce with her ex- husband Anthony– a successful stock broker, has moved in with her grandmother, Mable "Madea" Simmons. Madea is sick with complications from her diabetes. Another person Madea is helping out is Bobby, an ex-con. Bobby is Madea's handyman and usually cuts her grass. Both Madea and Vianne find him very attractive, though Vianne would not like to admit it. Vianne's niece, Keisha, is also staying with Madea. Keisha's mother, Maylee shows up to her school wearing a blond wig and a mini-skirt, embarrassing Keisha. Maylee later pops up at the house announcing her engagement to none other than Vianne's ex- husband, Anthony. Keisha is resentful towards her mother for being away for so long. When Anthony calls, Maylee drops everything to assist him, leaving Keisha all alone (Motherless Child). Cora, Madea's daughter, arrives, announcing she is only staying for the weekend, as she lives out of town. Keisha confides in her aunt about her troubles with the kids at school as they all bully her except for one kid, named Kelly. Madea's next door neighbor, Mr. Brown, also drops by and brings in her mail. While everyone is preparing for dinner, Bobby, taking a shower, runs downstairs to get some soap. While Bobby and Vianne flirt with each other, Madea can tell that Vianne secretly likes him. Tensions are high during dinner as Bobby and Anthony debate over their religious beliefs and Anthony insults Madea. The family then reminisces over their time in the church choir, singing old gospel favorites (Old Time Mix). Tensions blow soon after when Anthony starts insulting Vianne. Maylee and Vianne then get into a spat of their own. This leads a hurt Vianne to pull a knife on Anthony, alarming everybody. The entire family disperses, except Cora, who tries to calm Vianne down. Vianne, left with all the rubble of the night, tries to reflect (Lord I'm Sorry). ===Act Two=== Bobby returns, flirting with Vianne, and tells her his story of how he was incarcerated. Vianne opens up about her past relationships & newfound doubts while Bobby assures her their relationship will be different (Let Me Hold You). Maylee gets a call from the school nurse about Keisha. Anthony tells Maylee that she must either choose between him or her daughter, convinced she'd be an hindrance to his lifestyle. When Keisha arrives home, Maylee orders her to put her stuff down as they are going to go to the clinic. Keisha is pregnant with the neighbor boy, Kelly's child. Maylee insists she have an abortion. Cora tries to get through to her, but Maylee will not have it. It is revealed that Keisha was the product of a rape that Maylee endured at 13, by the hands of a man her mother let use her for drug money. With that, Maylee forces Keisha out of the house and Cora is left alone praying for the saving of her family (In the Name of Jesus). Madea gets a call from an Eric Jones offering Bobby a job and relays the message to Bobby and Vianne. When Maylee and Keisha get back from the clinic, Madea admonishes the both of them. It is, however, too late as Keisha is too far gone to get an abortion. Vianne tries to get Maylee to understand that Anthony does not love her and he is only marrying her to get back at Vianne. Maylee, upset, refuses to believe her. Bobby tells everyone about his job offer in California as Head Foreman, but he is reluctant to accept. Vianne and Bobby force Madea upstairs as they talk about their future. Bobby wants marriage and kids, but Vianne does not see it for her right now. As they talk, the doorbell rings and it is Mr. Brown, who is mad at Madea for giving his dog sleeping pills. Madea and Brown get into a light insulting match, leaving Vianne and Bobby to call the vet. The next day, while Bobby is packing his bags, he runs into Anthony. Anthony tries to turn Bobby against Vianne, again insulting her weight. Bobby tells Anthony that Vianne never loved him. Anthony threatens Bobby to move away to California and leave Vianne alone for good. Saying that if he stays here, then Anthony will call his probation officer and get him sent back to prison, seeing as they're old friends. Police sirens are then heard and Madea enters, running upstairs. Apparently, Madea and Maylee were out getting their nails done, when the nail salon employees began talking about Madea. One employee, in particular, insulted her, comparing her to Godzilla. So, she shot up the nail salon and hightailed home. Maylee comes back, angrily relaying the details to the boys. Bobby debates whether to stay or take the job offer in California. Vianne tells him to follow his heart. Bobby realizes he really wants to stay with Vianne even though she says she's not ready for a relationship. However, Bobby still walks out the door and heads for California. Madea tells Vianne that she needs to go after her man. After a few minutes of hesitation, Vianne decides to chase Bobby down before he leaves. However, as soon as Vianne opens the door, Bobby is revealed to be standing right there. Bobby comes inside and proposes to Vianne, and under Madea's direction, she agrees. Vianne drives Madea off to the casino. Maylee congratulates Bobby on the proposal, though she is admittedly jealous of their relationship. Cora gets Maylee and Keisha to reconcile (It’s Gonna Be Hallelujah). Later that day, Maylee brings Anthony his bags and lets him know that he will be driving home alone. Once Anthony leaves, Maylee apologizes to Vianne for everything. Cora gathers the family to reflect on all of the insight they've gained in spite of all of that has caused them pain in the past (God is the Answer). == Shows == Scheduled Shows Date City Venue September 28, 1999 Chicago New Regal Theater September 29, 1999 September 30, 1999 October 1, 1999 October 2, 1999 October 3, 1999 October 15, 1999 Memphis Orpheum Theatre October 16, 1999 October 17, 1999 November 11, 1999 Richmond Carpenter Center November 12, 1999 November 13, 1999 November 14, 1999 February 3, 2000 Indianapolis Murat Theatre February 4, 2000 February 5, 2000 February 6, 2000 February 29, 2000 Cleveland State Theatre March 1, 2000 March 2, 2000 March 3, 2000 March 4, 2000 October 3, 2000 Dallas Bruton Theatre October 4, 2000 October 5, 2000 October 6, 2000 October 7, 2000 October 8, 2000 October 11, 2000 Atlanta Atlanta Civic Center October 12, 2000 October 13, 2000 October 14, 2000 October 15, 2000 November 2, 2000 St. Louis Fox Theatre November 3, 2000 November 4, 2000 November 5, 2000 ==Cast== ===1999 Original Cast=== *Tyler Perry as Madea *Kisha Grandy as Vianne *Tyga Graham as Bobby *Tosha Moore as Maylee **Terri Brown-Britton (2000) *David Mann as Mr. Brown *Tamela Mann as Cora *Carl Pertile as Anthony ===2002 Film Cast=== *Tyler Perry as Madea *Kisha Grandy as Vianne *Tyga Graham as Bobby *Donna Stewart as Maylee *Carl Pertile as Anthony *Elaine O'Neale as Keisha *Tamela Mann as Cora *David Mann as Mr. Brown == The Band == * Elvin Ross - Musical Director * Mike Frazier - Bass * Sheryl Harper - Drums * Jerome Harmon - Keyboards * Jim Gorst - Sound * Davie Holmbo - Sound ==Musical numbers== All songs written and/or produced by Tyler Perry and Elvin D.

Her song, the spiritual, "Motherless Child" is a hold-over from Tyler Perry & T.D. Jakes' Woman, Thou Art Loosed!, which Elaine O'Neale also starred as Michelle. *Carl Pertile previously worked with Tyler Perry on his first play, I Know I've Been Changed. He later originated the role of Mike in Why Did I Get Married?. A show that Donna Stewart would also star in. *Kisha Grandy, Tamela Mann, and David Mann are original members of Kirk Franklin's group, The Family. In the shows that Kisha appeared, she would sing her rendition of the group's "Silver & Gold". While at the end, Kisha, Tamela, and David would close out the show with a medley of other memorable songs from their time with The Family. **On nights that Kisha didn't appear, "Bye Baby" would be sung in its place. *In the original show, "Let Me Hold You" included a second verse, in which Bobby proposes to Vianne. *Kelly Price was the original leading lady who was supposed to join the show, but pulled out at the last minute. She was supposed to play the role of "Aunt Lizzie", and sing a few of her own songs. Due to this sudden change, Madea's role was boosted over what was originally a short cameo, and the rest of her lines were split among the rest of the cast. *During the 2002 performance, there are mentions of characters and events that happen in the previously-taped show, Madea's Family Reunion, such as the revelation between Cora's daughters, Lisa & Tina. ==Film== A film adaptation titled of the same name was theatrically released on September 11, 2009. The film has a completely different storyline from the play, focusing on an alcoholic club singer (Taraji P. Henson) whose niece and nephews are taken under Madea's wing. It received positive reviews and was commercially successful. Vianne and Anthony were loosely adapted for A Madea Family Funeral. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Plays by Tyler Perry Category:1999 plays Category:Comedy plays Category:African-American plays Category:American plays adapted into films

25750703	I Am Jackie Chan	I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action is a 1998 autobiography written by Jackie Chan with help from Jeff Yang, written before Chan's success Rush Hour-a special edition of the book was released in 1999 telling events occurring after Chan's success with the movie. The book tells of Chan's life story from when he was born to several months after Rush Hour was made. The last few pages of the book contain a Top 10 list of Chan's favorite stunts and fights and an almost complete filmography of him. The book was dedicated to his parents. On January 7, 2010, on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien, Chan stated that he has had plans since around 2008 to produce a musical film of his life based on the book, which would be entitled I Am Jackie Chan: The Musical. The film was inspired due to Chan's early love for musicals, with such films as The Sound of Music. The movie ended up never coming to fruition. ==References== ==External links== *Official Site * Category:1998 non-fiction books Category:1999 non-fiction books Category:Show business memoirs Category:Random House books Category:Jackie Chan
25775326	I Break Chairs	I Break Chairs is Damien Jurado's fourth album, and first with his backing band, Gathered in Song. The album was produced by the former lead singer of Pedro the Lion and Headphones, David Bazan. == Track listing == All songs written by Damien Jurado, except Air Show Disaster written by Josh Golden. #"Paperwings" – 2:55 #"Dancing" – 4:02 #"Birdcage" – 2:13 #"Inevitable" – 2:11 #"Air Show Disaster" – 2:24 #"Never Ending Tide" – 4:44 #"Big Deal" – 2:23 #"The Way You Look" – 3:12 #"Castles" – 2:25 #"Like Titanic" – 3:26 #"Parade" – 2:34 #"Lose My Head" – 5:21 ==Personnel== *Damien Jurado – guitar, vocals *Eric Fisher – guitar, glockenspiel, keyboards *Andrew Myers – drums, glockenspiel *Josh Golden - Bass, Guitar, Vocals *David Bazan – producer, engineer, mixing *Jesse LeDoux – design *Aaron Sprinkle – mixing *Rick Fisher – mastering ==Reception== Heather Phares of Allmusic writes that I Break Chairs "proves that [Damien Jurado] can rock with the best" and the music is "emotionally deep as it is musically diverse". Andy Cockle of Dusted writes that Jurado "displays his golden throat, though the setting seems a bit different" and that the addition of his backing band, Gathered in Song, "allows Jurado to create hopeful pop after providing us with several albums of harrowing solitude". Brad Haywood of Pitchfork Media laments "Jurado's prior three releases was honest, introspective, moody, sometimes peppy and sometimes heartbreaking. The new Jurado is none of those things" and "a return to normalcy would be welcome". Colleen Delaney of Stylus writes "it's too hard to compare I Break Chairs to anything because it's got that sort of timeless quality to it" and "it's bringing me back to the salad days [of indie pop] of 1992, 1993". ==References== Category:2002 albums Category:Damien Jurado albums Category:Sub Pop albums

"After writing several lines to the song, I looked back and saw the line 'I can't stop loving you.'

26315867	I Can Make You Love Me	I Can Make You Love Me, also known as Stalking Laura, is an American 1993 made-for-television psychological thriller film starring Richard Thomas and Brooke Shields. The film is based on the real-life story of American mass murderer Richard Farley, a former employee of ESL Incorporated whose romantic obsession and subsequent stalking of co-worker Laura Black culminated in the mass murder of several co-workers at ESL's headquarters in California, resulting in the first anti-stalking laws to be enacted in the United States. ==Plot== Laura Black, a young and ambitious intern from Virginia, accepts a job at Kensitron Electronics International (KEI) in Silicon Valley, California. During a tour of her new workplace, Laura meets long-time KEI employee Richard Farley. Richard invites her to a local tractor pull, but she politely refuses. She later visits an apartment in Sunnyvale, and is accepted as a new roommate by the current tenant. On her first day at the office, Richard is waiting at her new work station with fresh-baked blueberry bread to show his affections. In the days that follow, Laura enrolls in a local aerobics class. When the class dismisses, Richard meets Laura in the parking lot and asks her out, but she politely refuses and informs him that their relationship is only professional. Richard continues to make advances on Laura. At a KEI softball game, Laura once again denies that their relationship extends outside the workplace. During the game, Laura's new friend and co- worker Glenda Moritz takes note of Richard's infatuation with her. Richard also becomes offended when he notices Laura and Glenda looking toward him laughing. Through an excuse of wanting to present a staff birthday celebration for Laura, Richard is permitted by a coworker to see her personal dossier, from which he learns of her birthday and address, later showing up at her apartment with a gift. When her roommate says she should inform KEI management of the apparent stalking, Laura insists that she can handle Richard. Laura later finds her tires slashed at her home. She calls the police about the incident and suspects Richard as the culprit. Richard later confronts Laura on her suspicions. Laura finally approaches KEI management to file a formal complaint; but management brushes it off. However, management instructs Richard to leave her alone at work, which he skirts by enrolling in the same non-work aerobics class as Laura. Richard later photographs Laura from the yard in front of her house, and uses the photos to doctor a picture of himself and Laura together. Laura and her roommate relocate to a new apartment, which is gated for added security. Richard later sneaks into Laura's office after hours and discovers her new address, as well as her family records. Richard then threatens to go after one of Laura's sisters if Laura does not accept that she "is meant for him." While visiting her family for Christmas in Virginia, a gift arrives: the above-mentioned doctored photograph of the two of them together. Laura then files a second complaint at KEI upon her return, again with little effect. After being obligated to attend a counseling session at work, an enraged Richard confronts Laura in the ladies' restroom at a restaurant, threatening her for not accepting his advances. Laura reports the incident to KEI management, and Richard declares that he will kill anyone who attempts to interfere with his "private relationships." He is later fired, though Laura is told it was because the quality of his work went down. The harassment continues on an irregular basis. Laura begins dating Sam Waters, who fears for Laura's safety. To protect her, Sam teaches her how to use a gun for self-defense. When Richard breaks into her garage and leaves a note on her windshield, Laura confronts him and he casually brushes it off with yet another advance. At work, Laura receives a major promotion that is delayed when she is unable to obtain security clearance. Thinking the delay is because of Richard's harassment, Laura's supervisor Chris convinces Laura to serve papers on Richard for a restraining order. Enraged by the restraining order, Richard purchases numerous guns and over 2000 rounds of ammunition. At work, Laura is looking forward to her upcoming court appearance for the restraining order to become permanent. On that same day, Richard arrives at the KEI offices in an RV, bringing numerous shotguns, revolvers and explosives. He blasts his way through the lobby and into the secure offices, shooting several employees and killing Glenda along the way. Richard bursts into Laura's office, shooting her in the left shoulder and leaving her for dead, though she is only unconscious. SWAT units arrive and evacuate most of the building, though Richard remains holed up with dozens of hostages. While hostage negotiator Lt. Grijalva speaks with Richard; Laura, although weakened due to loss of blood, makes her way through the ransacked offices. Richard attempts to convince Lt. Grijalva that Laura is the guilty party for refusing dates with him, and insists that she was the one messing with him. Laura finally manages to escape the building and is rushed to a hospital for surgery on her shoulder. Richard continues his rampage, at one point executing one of his surviving victims, unknowingly shoots Chris through a wall, but also permits his former landlady Nancy to leave the building unharmed. Richard demands a sandwich and a beverage from the authorities while he considers surrendering. Hours later, the police produce the food and drink, but Grijalva tells Richard that they do not have the proper means of getting it to him. Overcome with exhaustion and dehydration, Richard agrees to surrender to the police. Seemingly unconcerned by the carnage he has caused, Richard asks Grijalva if he thinks Laura will remember all this. ==Cast== * Richard Thomas as Richard Farley * Brooke Shields as Laura Black * Viveka Davis as Mary Ann, Laura's roommate. * William Allen Young as Chris, Laura's section manager at K.E.I. * Richard Yniguez as Lt.

It was released by Blue Note Records on November 17, 2003, in the United Kingdom and on November 18 in the United States. Produced by Willie Mitchell, the album was Green's first since 1995, his first for Blue Note, and his first collaboration with Mitchell since 1985's He Is the Light; it was also Green's first entirely secular recording since the 1970s. The reunion between Green and Mitchell was highly anticipated and I Can't Stop was a commercial success, peaking at number 53 on the US Billboard 200 and number 9 on the Top R&B;/Hip- Hop Albums charts. It was Green's highest placing on both charts since his 1975 album Al Green Is Love. The album was nominated for the 2004 Grammy Award for Best R&B; Album, while its title track also received a nod in the Best Traditional R&B; Performance category. ==Critical reception== I Can't Stop received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, it received an average score of 75 out of 100, based on 18 reviews. Mojo opined "(Green) is, if anything, singing better than ever". In The Guardian, Alexis Petridis stated "The songwriting is largely superb, which keeps the album from sounding like a clever pastiche".The Guardian: CD of the week November 14, 2003 Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, said that the album is not a sophisticated modernization or comeback to "a form he never lost", but instead shows that Green has "retained plenty of voice and the guile to know what to do with it." In a mixed review, Tom Smucker of The Village Voice felt that Green gets "tied down when production's slathered on a bit too thick".Village Voice December 16, 2003 Blender magazine dismissed it as "a weak echo of those gloriously clean and spacious [1970s] LPs". In a retrospective review for the magazine, Christgau gave the album four stars and called it Green's "finest late pop album". He felt that, although Green "can no longer shade with sprightly delicacy," his singing is louder and strengthened by "two decades in the pulpit at his own Memphis church." ==Track listing== *All tracks written by Al Green and Willie Mitchell except where noted. #"I Can't Stop" - 3:48 #"Play to Win" - 4:38 #"Rainin' in My Heart" - 4:45* #"I've Been Waitin' on You" (Green) - 3:43 #"You" - 4:29 #"Not Tonight" - 4:25 #"Million to One" - 4:52 #"My Problem Is You" - 6:28 #"I'd Still Choose You" - 4:05 #"I've Been Thinkin' 'Bout You" (Green) - 4:04 #"I'd Write a Letter" (Green) - 3:53 #"Too Many" (Green) - 4:01 *"Rainin' in My Heart" is a new song written by Green & Mitchell for this album.

26324850	I Am the West	I Am the West is the ninth studio album by American rapper Ice Cube. It was released on September 28, 2010 by Lench Mob Records and EMI. ==Background== Ice Cube said this album would be different from any one of his others, having a different direction. The album was released independently under his label Lench Mob. Ice Cube stated that "being independent is beautiful because we can do things 'out the box' that record companies would usually frown at. Instead of working from a ready-made cookie-cutter marketing plan, we can tailor make a marketing plan specifically for me". In an interview with Baller Status, Ice Cube spoke on two songs that were going to be on the album, "Man vs. Machine" and "Hood Robbin". "'Man vs. Machine' is talking about our obsessions with machinery and how it's taking over. Automation is taking over human beings in all our relevancy in this world. Pretty soon, machines are gonna take over and that's just real...['Hood Robbin'] is talking about how big corporations is now stealing from the poor and giving to the rich. It's a whole thing about the things we're going up against with housing and medical insurance ... just everything people are going through. Real shit that ain't got nothing to do with money, cars, and all the shit most rappers talk about." Young Maylay made guest appearances on the album.Icecube.com Ice Cube confirmed that Dr. Dre would no longer be on the album in August. He received beats from West coast veteran producers such as DJ Quik, Dr. Dre, E-A-Ski, and Sir Jinx, not having worked on a solo album with the latter in nearly 20 years.

Jeff Weiss from The L.A. Times music blog gave it 2 and a half out of 4 stars stating "Even the greatest can use a little help from their friends, and all too often this feels like how the West was one-dimensional." Allmusic reviewer David Jeffries said "I Am the West shows the younger generation how to cross 40 while retaining their freedom and baller status. Middle age hip-hop is born here, and if the game follows his lead, it will be one monster of a genre.

267656	I Corps (United Kingdom)	I Corps ("First Corps") was an army corps in existence as an active formation in the British Army for most of the 80 years from its creation in the First World War until the end of the Cold War, longer than any other corps. It had a short-lived precursor during the Waterloo Campaign. ==Napoleonic precursor== Assembling an army in Belgium to fight Napoleon's resurgent forces in the spring of 1815, the Duke of Wellington formed it into army corps, deliberately mixing units from the Anglo-Hanoverian, Dutch-Belgian and German contingents so that the weaker elements would be stiffened by more experienced or reliable troops. As he put it: 'It was necessary to organize these troops in brigades, divisions, and corps d’armee with those better disciplined and more accustomed to war'.Hofschroer, Ligny and Quatre Bras, p.109. He placed I Corps under the command of the Prince of Orange and it was this corps that was first contacted by the advancing French at Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815. However, Wellington did not employ the corps as tactical entities, and continued his accustomed practice of issuing orders directly to divisional and lower commanders. When he drew up his army on the ridge at Waterloo, elements of the various corps were mixed up, and although he gave the Prince of Orange nominal command of the centre, that officer had different forces under him. Subsequent to the battle, the corps structure was re-established for the advance into France, I Corps being commanded by Maj-Gen Sir John Byng, the Prince of Orange having been wounded at Waterloo.Hofschroer, The German Victory, p.201. ===Composition of I Corps in the Waterloo Campaign=== General Officer Commanding (GOC): General The Prince of Orange * 1st (British) Division (British Guards) * 3rd (British) Division (Anglo-Hanoverian) * 2nd (Netherlands) Division (Dutch- Belgian) * 3rd (Netherlands) Division (Dutch-Belgian) ==Prior to the First World War== After Waterloo the army corps structure largely disappeared from the British Army, except for ad hoc formations assembled during annual manoeuvres (e.g. Army Manoeuvres of 1913). In 1876 a Mobilisation Scheme for eight army corps was published, with 'First Corps' based on Colchester. In 1880 First Corps' organization was: * 1st Division (Colchester) ** 1st Brigade (Colchester) *** 1st Bn. 2nd Foot (Colchester), 1st Bn. 10th Foot (Colchester) ** 2nd Brigade (Colchester) *** 1st Bn. 9th Foot (Kinsale), 28th Foot (Fermoy) ** Divisional Troops *** 2nd Bn. 12th Foot (Portsmouth), Buckinghamshire Yeomanry (Buckingham), 1st Company Royal Engineers (Shorncliffe) ** Artillery *** F/1st Brigade Royal Artillery (Ipswich), D/1st Brigade RA (Woolwich) * 2nd Division (Chelmsford) ** 1st Brigade (Chelmsford) *** 1st Bn. 15th Foot (Tipperary), 47th Foot (The Curragh) ** 2nd Brigade (Warley) *** 1st Bn. 3rd Foot (Shorncliffe), 49th Foot (Dover), 55th Foot (Shorncliffe) ** Divisional Troops *** 1st Bn. 23rd Foot (Woolwich), Hertfordshire Yeomanry (St Albans), 20th Company Royal Engineers (Chatham) ** Artillery *** I/4th Brigade RA (Newcastle), N/4th Brigade RA (Woolwich), M/4th Brigade RA (Newcastle) * 3rd Division (Gravesend) ** 1st Brigade (Gravesend) *** 77th Foot (Dublin), 104th Foot (Belfast), 105th Foot (Newry) ** 2nd Brigade (Chatham) *** 2nd Bn. 5th Foot (Chatham), 31st Foot (Chatham), 86th Foot (Chatham) ** Divisional Troops *** 87th Foot (Limerick), West Kent Yeomanry (Maidstone), 22nd Company Royal Engineers (Woolwich) ** Artillery *** O/4th Brigade RA (Weedon), A/5th Brigade RA (Weedon) * Cavalry Brigade (Maldon) ** 3rd Hussars (Colchester), 4th Hussars (Shorncliffe), Suffolk Yeomanry (Bury St Edmunds), F Battery C Brigade Royal Horse Artillery (Canterbury) * Corps Artillery (Colchester) ** E Battery C Brigade RHA (Woolwich), H Battery A Brigade RHA (Woolwich) ** G/1st Brigade RA (Woolwich), B/5th Brigade RA (Sheffield) * Corps Engineers (Colchester) ** A (Pontoons) Troop Royal Engineer Train (Aldershot) ** C (Telegraph) Troop Royal Engineer Train (Aldershot) ** 23rd Company Royal Engineers and Field Park (Chatham) This scheme had been dropped by 1881.Army List 1876–1881. The Stanhope Memorandum of 1891 (drawn up by Edward Stanhope when Secretary of State for War) laid down the policy that after providing for garrisons and India, the army should be able to mobilise three army corps for home defence, two of regular troops and one partly of militia, each of three divisions. Only after those commitments, it was hoped, might two army corps be organised for the unlikely eventuality of deployment abroad.Dunlop ch 2. When the Second Anglo-Boer War was imminent in September 1899, a field army, referred to as the Army Corps (sometimes I Army Corps) was mobilised and sent to Cape Town. It was, in fact, 'about the equivalent of the First Army Corps of the existing mobilization scheme',Dunlop p 72. and was placed under the command of Gen Sir Redvers Buller, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Aldershot Command. However, once in South Africa the corps never operated as such, and the three divisions (1st, 2nd and 3rd) were widely dispersed. The 1901 Army Estimates introduced by St John Brodrick allowed for six army corps based on the six regional commands (Aldershot, Southern, Irish, Eastern, Northern and Scottish) of which only I Corps (Aldershot Command) and II Corps (Southern Command on Salisbury Plain) would be entirely formed of regular troops.Dunlop pp 130-40. However, these arrangements remained theoretical, the title 'I Corps' being added to Aldershot Command. In early October 1902 a memorandum was issued showing the organization and allocation of the 1st Army Corps, to which Sir John French had recently been appointed in command: * 1st Division ** 1st Brigade (Guards) (Marlborough Lines) ** 2nd Infantry Brigade (HQ Blackdown) ** One squadron of cavalry, two brigade divisions Royal Field Artillery, an ammunition column, a field company Royal Engineers, one company Army Service Corps, a field hospital * 2nd Division ** 3rd Infantry Brigade (HQ Stanhope Lines) ** 4th Infantry Brigade (HQ Wellington) ** One squadron of cavalry, two brigade divisions Royal Field Artillery, an ammunition column, a field company Royal Engineers, one company Army Service Corps, a field hospital * 3rd Division ** 5th Infantry Brigade (HQ Bordon) ** 6th Infantry Brigade (HQ Bordon) ** One squadron of cavalry, two brigade divisions Royal Field Artillery, an ammunition column, a field company Royal Engineers, one company Army Service Corps, a field hospital * 1st Cavalry Brigade (South Cavalry Barracks) In 1907 the title changed to 'Aldershot Corps' but reverted to simply 'Aldershot Command' the following year.Army List Finally, the Haldane Reforms of 1907 established a six-division British Expeditionary Force for deployment overseas, but only Aldershot Command possessed two infantry divisions and a full complement of 'army troops' to form an army corps in the field.Dunlop p 262. ==First World War== Pre-war planning for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) did not envisage any intermediate headquarters between GHQ and the six infantry divisions, but it was assumed that if corps HQs became necessary, then the GOC Aldershot Command would automatically become GOC I Corps in the field.Neillands, p. 169. On mobilisation in August 1914 the decision was made to conform to the two-division army corps organisation employed by the French armies alongside which the BEF was to operate.Official History 1914, Volume I, p. 7. Sir Douglas Haig, then commanding at Aldershot, therefore took I Corps HQ to France with 1st Division and 2nd Division under command, and it remained on the Western Front throughout the war. It had a peripheral part at the Battle of Mons, then saw hard fighting at the Battle of the Aisne and First Battle of Ypres in 1914, at the Battle of Aubers Ridge in the Spring of 1915 and alongside the Canadian Corps at the Battle of Hill 70, as well in many other large battles of the First World War. ===Composition of I Corps in First World War=== The composition of army corps changed frequently. Some representative orders of battle for I Corps are given here. Order of Battle at Mons 23 August 1914Official History 1914, Volume I, Appendix 1.

Once the era of trench warfare had set in on the Western Front (1915–17), the BEF left its army corps in position for long periods, so that they became familiar with their sector, while rotating divisions as they required rest, training, or transfer to other sectors.Sanders Marble, 'Offensive versus Subsidiary Attacks, 1916–1918: The British Expeditionary Force Balancing its Options', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Volume 87, No 351 (Autumn 2009). From May 1916 to August 1917, I Corps Cavalry Regiment was provided by the 1st South Irish Horse.James, p. 15.

After the Germans broke through Allied lines in the Battle of France in May 1940, the BEF was forced to retreat to Dunkirk for evacuation to England. The Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the BEF, General Lord Gort, ordered Barker to form the rearguard with I Corps to cover the evacuation, and surrender to the Germans as a last resort. However, the acting commander of II Corps, Major General Bernard Montgomery, advised Gort that Barker was in an unfit state to be left in final command, and recommended that Major General Harold Alexander of the 1st Division should be put in charge. Gort did as Montgomery advised, and in the event the bulk of I Corps was successfully evacuated. As Montgomery recalled: '"Alex" got everyone away in his own calm and confident manner'.Montgomery p. 64 ===Composition of I Corps in the Battle of France=== The order of battle was as follows: General Officer Commanding: Lieutenant General M.G.H. Barker * 1st Infantry Division * 2nd Infantry Division * 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division * Royal Artillery ** 27th Army Field Regiment (21/24 & 37/47 Batteries) ** 140th (5th London) Army Field Regiment (366 (10th London) & 367 (11th London) Batteries) ** 3rd Medium Regiment (2/11 & 6/10 Batteries) ** 5th Medium Regiment (15/17 & 20/21 Batteries) ** 52nd (East Lancashire) Light Anti- Aircraft Regiment (154, 155 & 156 Batteries) ** 2nd Light Anti-Aircraft Battery ** 1st Survey Regiment * I Corps Troops, Royal Engineers ** 102nd, 107th, 221st Army Field Companies ** 105th Corps Field Park Company ** 13th Corps Field Survey Company * Infantry—Machine Gun ** 2nd Battalion, Cheshire Regiment ** 4th Battalion, Cheshire Regiment ** 2nd Battalion, Manchester Regiment ===North-West Europe=== After returning to England I Corps then remained in the United Kingdom, based at Hickleton Hall in South Yorkshire within Northern Command on anti-invasion duties, preparing defences to repel a German invasion of the United Kingdom.Newbold, p. 202 thumb|right|Lieutenant General John Crocker, pictured here in August 1944. I Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant General John Crocker, then took part in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 where, along with XXX Corps, under Lieutenant General Gerard Bucknall (who had commanded I Corps between April and August 1943), it was a spearhead corps of Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey's British Second Army, itself part of the 21st Army Group. The corps was then involved in the Battle of Normandy in fierce attritional fighting for control of the Normandy beachhead. After fighting for two months in the Battle for Caen, I Corps was subordinated on 1 August 1944 to the Canadian First Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Harry Crerar, for the remainder of the Normandy campaign Hart, p.19 and the subsequent operations in the Low Countries.Williams, p. 466. participating in Operation Astonia, the capture of Le Havre, and the operations to clear the Channel Coast, later helping to garrison "The Island" area between Arnhem and Nijmegen in the aftermath of the failed airborne invasion of the Netherlands, Operation Market Garden. During Operation Pheasant, I Corps was unique in that it fielded multi national divisionsm - Polish 1st Armoured Division, the Canadian 4th Armoured Division the British 49th Polar Bears Division and the US 104th Timberwolf Division. After the Battle of the Scheldt I Corps Headquarters then took over administration of the 21st Army Group's logistics area around the port of Antwerp, Belgium until the end of the war. ===Composition of I Corps in NW Europe Campaign=== General Officer Commanding: Lieutenant-General John Crocker * Corps troops:Forty, p 346. ** Inns of Court Regiment, Royal Armoured Corps (armoured cars) ** 62nd (6th London) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery ** 102nd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery ** 9th Survey Regiment, RA ** I Corps Troops, Royal Engineers ** I Corps Signals, Royal Corps of Signals Attached: * 4th Army Group, Royal Artillery ** 150th (South Nottinghamshire Hussars) Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (suspended animation January 1945) ** 53rd (London) Medium Regiment, RA (209 & 210 (London) Batteries) ** 65th (Highland) Medium Regiment, RA (222 (Fraserburgh) & 223 (Banffshire) Batteries) ** 68th Medium Regiment, RA (233 & 234 Batteries) ** 79th (Scottish Horse Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, RA ** 51st (Lowland) Heavy Regiment, RA Assignments of corps to armies, and divisions to corps, changed frequently during the campaign: As of 6 June 1944Ellis, p.181 * British 3rd Infantry Division * 3rd Canadian Infantry Division * 6th Airborne Division As of 7 July 1944 * British 3rd Infantry Division * 3rd Canadian Infantry Division * 51st (Highland) Infantry Division * 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division * 6th Airborne Division As of 1 August 1944 (now part of First Canadian Army) * 51st (Highland) Infantry Division * 6th Airborne Division (returned to United Kingdom 3 September 1944) * 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division * 7th Armoured Division ==British Army of the Rhine== After the defeat of Germany, the 21st Army Group became the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), and 1 Corps, under the command of Lieutenant-General Ivor Thomas, was transformed into a corps district, with an administrative, rather than combat, role. It was disbanded in 1947.The British Army in Germany: An Organizational History 1947-2004 By Graham Watson, Richard A. Rinaldi, Page 11 Tiger Lily, 2005, However, in October 1951 the corps was reactivated to become the principal combat element of the BAOR, with its HQ based in Bielefeld. In March 1952, following the reactivation of 6th Armoured Division, its component formations were: * 2nd Infantry Division * 6th Armoured Division * 7th Armoured Division * 11th Armoured Division Included as part of this was Canada's contribution to the NATO land forces in Germany. A Canadian mechanised brigade remained part of BAOR until 1970. The size of this force, 6,700, was such that it was referred to within British circles as a "light division". 4th Division was reformed from 11th Armoured Division on 1 April 1956. In a following 1958-60 reorganisation the Corps was formed into three mixed armour/infantry divisions including five brigade groups, which were in 1965 brought together into three centralised divisions (1st, 2nd, and 4th). In 1958, the "infantry" designation was dropped from the 2nd Infantry Division's title as part of this reorganisation. During the 1970s, 4th Division consisted of two "square" brigades. With the end of National Service, manpower across the whole of BAOR dropped from around 77,000 to 55,000. In the late 1970s the Corps was reorganised as four small five-battle-group armoured divisions plus a roughly brigade sized infantry 'Field Force'. It then comprised: * 1st Armoured Division * 2nd Armoured Division * 3rd Armoured Division * 4th Armoured Division - formed 1978 and served with I (BR) Corps with its headquarters at Hammersmith Barracks in Herford. * 5th Field Force Following the 1981-3 reorganisation, the Corps consisted of 1st and 4th Armoured Divisions, which would have manned the front line against the anticipated attack by the Soviet 3rd Shock Army, plus in an in-depth, reserve role the 3rd Armoured Division and finally the 2nd Infantry Division which was tasked with rear-area security.Isby & Kamps, pp.256-258 * 1st Armoured Division ** 7th Armoured Brigade ** 12th Armoured Brigade ** 22nd Armoured Brigade * 3rd Armoured Division ** 4th Armoured Brigade ** 6th Armoured Brigade ** 33rd Armoured Brigade * 4th Armoured Division ** 11th Armoured Brigade ** 20th Armoured Brigade ** 19th Infantry Brigade (in UK) * 2nd Infantry Division (in UK) ** 15th Infantry Brigade (TA) ** 24th Airmobile Brigade ** 49th Infantry Brigade (TA) * The Artillery Division (HQ Ripon Barracks, Bielefeld) : center|1000px|Structure of the 1 British Corps in 1989. With the end of the Cold War, in 1992 1 (BR) Corps was disbanded, and its HQ closed. Some of the staff serving in HQ 1(BR) Corps were reassigned to the new HQ UK Support Command (Germany) which was formed from the rump of HQ BAOR. The remainder of the staff formed the British component (50% of the total staff in the HQ) in the Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (HQ ARRC), a newly instated multi-national NATO Rapid Reaction Corps HQ. The Corps Commander reported to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe SACEUR, but had no troops under command except when assigned to ARRC by NATO member nations, for operations or for exercises. HQ ARRC moved to Rheindahlen in 1994. ==General Officers Commanding== Commanders have included:Army Commands * 1815 General The Prince of Orange From 1901 to 1905 the commander of the troops at Aldershot was also commander 1st Army Corps * 1 October 1901: General Sir Redvers Buller * 25 October 1901: Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Hildyard, temporary * 15 September 1902: Lieutenant-General Sir John French * 1914 Lieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig * 1914–1915 Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Monro * 1915–1916 Lieutenant-General Sir Hubert Gough * 1916 Lieutenant General Charles Kavanagh * 1916 Major-General Havelock Hudson * 1916 Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Anderson * 1917 Major-General John Capper * 1917–1918 Lieutenant-General Arthur Holland * 1918 Major-General Sir Hugh Jeudwine * 1918 Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Holland Note: I Corps was disbanded at the end of the First World War and reformed at the start of the Second World War * 1939–1940 General Sir John Dill * 1940 Lieutenant-General Michael Barker * 1940 Lieutenant-General Harold Alexander * 1940–1941 Lieutenant-General Laurence Carr * 1941–1942 Lieutenant-General Henry Willcox * 1942–1943 Lieutenant-General Frederick Morgan * Apr-Aug 1943 Lieutenant- General Gerard Bucknall * 1943–1945 Lieutenant-General John Crocker * 1945 Lieutenant-General Sidney Kirkman * 1945–1947 Lieutenant-General Ivor Thomas Note: I Corps was disbanded in June 1947 and reformed in late 1951 * 1951–1953 Lieutenant-General Sir Dudley Ward * 1953–1954 Lieutenant-General Sir James Cassels * 1954–1956 Lieutenant-General Sir Hugh Stockwell * 1956–1958 Lieutenant-General Sir Harold Pyman * 1958–1960 Lieutenant-General Sir Michael West * 1960–1962 Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Jones * 1962–1963 Lieutenant- General Sir Kenneth Darling * 1963–1966 Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Goodwin * 1966–1968 Lieutenant-General Sir John Mogg * 1968–1970 Lieutenant-General Sir Mervyn Butler * 1970–1972 Lieutenant-General Sir John Sharp * 1972–1974 Lieutenant-General Sir Roland Gibbs * 1974–1976 Lieutenant-General Sir Jack Harman * 1976–1978 Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Worsley * 1978–1980 Lieutenant-General Sir Peter Leng * 1980–1983 Lieutenant-General Sir Nigel Bagnall * 1983–1985 Lieutenant-General Sir Martin Farndale * 1985–1987 Lieutenant-General Sir Brian Kenny * 1987–1989 Lieutenant-General Sir Peter Inge * 1989–1991 Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Guthrie * 1991–1992 Lieutenant-General Sir Jeremy Mackenzie ==Notes== ==References== * * Dunlop, Colonel John K., The Development of the British Army 1899–1914, London, Methuen (1938). * Ellis, John, The World War II Databook.

2679185	I Am the Portuguese Blues	I Am the Portuguese Blues is the eighth full-length album released by Starflyer 59. With this album, the band returned to its past in multiple ways. The band's earlier albums had been characterized by loud guitars, but later albums saw the band progress to a softer sound, incorporating keyboards. I Am the Portuguese Blues saw the return of the sound from earlier albums, as the band was stripped just to Jeff Cloud on bass, Frank Lenz on drums, and Jason Martin, the only person to perform on all of Starflyer 59's albums, handling guitar and vocal duties. In addition, the album has a monochromatic cover, similar to those of Starflyer 59's first three albums (Silver, Gold, and Americana). Many of the songs on I Am the Portuguese Blues were written years earlier as demos for an album to follow Americana. They were eventually scrapped, as the band decided to take a different musical direction for The Fashion Focus. The old demos were refined and combined with several new songs for I Am the Portuguese Blues. In regards to the title of the album, Martin, the band's frontman said, > "I thought the title was odd. There are a couple of proper blues riffs‚ on > there, but mainly it is just a rock and roll album – no tricks no > gimmicks.... And, oh yeah, I'm Portuguese." ==Track listing== All songs written by Jason Martin. ==Personnel== *Jason Martin – vocals, guitar, engineer, art direction *Jeff Cloud – bass guitar *Frank Lenz – drums *Aaron Sprinkle – mixing *Troy Glessner – mastering *Brandon Ebel – executive Producer *Kris McCaddon – art direction, design ==References== Category:Starflyer 59 albums Category:2004 albums Category:Tooth & Nail Records albums

26937541	I Beg Your Pardon	"I Beg Your Pardon" is the debut single by Canadian synth-pop duo Kon Kan, from their 1989 debut album Move to Move. It was written and produced by Kon Kan member Barry Harris. American musician Joe South also received a songwriting credit, due to the song's sampling of Lynn Anderson's 1970 hit "Rose Garden", which he wrote. Harris said that the song was "the question to Lynn Anderson's 'Rose Garden' answer." It was Harris's first studio project, and was initially released on an unknown independent record label in Toronto. "I Beg Your Pardon" also contains samples of other songs, including GQ's "Disco Nights (Rock-Freak)", Silver Convention's "Get Up and Boogie", and Spagna's "Call Me". Music critic James Masterton wrote that the song was one of the first big club hits to contain prominent samples. The song was a hit, reaching the top twenty in a number of countries including the UK and U.S., where it peaked at numbers 5 and 15, respectively. ==Background== Barry Harris took inspiration from the Pet Shop Boys' 1987 single "Always on My Mind", which had repurposed Willie Nelson's 1982 country ballad into an upbeat synthpop song. Harris wanted to do the same with Lynn Anderson's 1970 country hit "Rose Garden". As he was a DJ at the time, he was "exploding with ideas" for little sounds he incorporated into "I Beg Your Pardon". Harris said, "The lyrics were about my first love relationship. As I had never really attempted to write lyrics seriously before, I already had the melody of the verses in my head so I simply started with a 'Once Upon a Time' idea… 'there once was a time and there once was a way…' and it pretty much flowed from there." Musically, in this song, Harris also wanted to emulate "Bass (How Low Can You Go)" by Simon Harris, as well as "S'Express", two sample-based hits from 1988. The result was unique; Masterton wrote that Kon Kan's pop song "sounded like very little else on the market," and was quickly rewarded with chart success. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1988–89) Peak position Australian Singles Chart 100 Canada Top Singles (RPM)RPM Top Singles - March 27, 1989, p.6 RPM Magazine 19 Dutch Singles Chart 3 German Singles Chart 8 New Zealand Singles Chart 7 UK Singles Chart 5 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 15 U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play 3 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1988–89) Peak position Canada Dance/Urban (RPM) 12 ==References== Category:1988 songs Category:1988 debut singles Category:Kon Kan songs Category:Songs written by Joe South Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:Juno Award for Dance Recording of the Year recordings

27588976	I Am Number Four (film)	I Am Number Four is a 2011 American teen science fiction action film directed by D. J. Caruso and starring Alex Pettyfer, Timothy Olyphant, Teresa Palmer, Dianna Agron, and Callan McAuliffe. The screenplay, by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Marti Noxon, is based on the 2010 novel of the same name, one of the Lorien Legacies young adult science fiction novels. The film follows a teenage alien on Earth fleeing other aliens who are hunting him down. Produced by Michael Bay, I Am Number Four was the first film production from DreamWorks Pictures to be released by Touchstone Pictures, as part of the studio's 2009 distribution deal with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The Hollywood Reporter estimated the budget to be between $50 million and $60 million. The film was released in both conventional and IMAX theatres on February 18, 2011, received generally negative reviews, and flopped at the box office, grossing $149.9 million against a budget of $50‒59 million. ==Plot== John Smith is an alien from the planet Lorien. He was sent to Earth as a child with eight others, collectively called the Garde, to escape the invading Mogadorians, who destroyed Lorien. John is protected by a guardian (who are known as Cêpan), Henri, and has developed powers, including enhanced strength, speed and agility. The Mogadorians, led by Commander Setrakus Ra, learn about the nine children and travel to Earth. The Garde can only be killed in sequence; Number One through Number Nine. Three of them are already dead, with John being Number Four. Knowing this, he and Henri move from a beachside bungalow in Florida to an old farm in Paradise, Ohio, where John befriends conspiracy theorist Sam Goode and a Beagle which he names Bernie Kosar. He also falls for an amateur photographer, Sarah Hart. Her ex-boyfriend, football player Mark James, is a bully who torments both John and Sam. During the Spring Scream Festival, Mark and his friends chase Sarah and John into the woods. When they attack, John uses his powers to fend them off and rescue Sarah. Sam witnesses this, which leads John to reveal his true origins. The next day, Mark's father, the local sheriff, interrogates Henri on John's whereabouts when his son and his friends were attacked. Henri tells John that too many people are suspicious and they have to leave. John refuses because of Sarah. The Mogadorians continue searching for John, while being trailed by Number Six, who is also trying to locate Number Four. Number Six's guardian was killed, and she realizes that the remaining six Garde will have to team up and fight against the Mogadorians. The Mogadorians locate John and manipulate two conspiracy theorists into capturing Henri. When John and Sam go to rescue Henri, they have to fend off an attack by the Mogadorians. Henri dies, while John and Sam escape with some Lorien artefacts, including a blue rock that acts as a tracking device for other Garde. Sam's father, a conspiracy theorist who disappeared while hunting aliens in Mexico, had another of the rocks. While Sam searches for it, John tries to say goodbye to Sarah at a party, only to discover that the Mogadorians have framed him and Henri for the murders of the conspiracy theorists. Mark sees John and calls his father, who corners John and Sarah. John saves Sarah from a fall, revealing his powers, and they escape to their school. Setrakus Ra arrives in Paradise, with a convoy of trucks. He is confronted by Mark and his father, and after injuring the sheriff, he forces Mark to show him where John is hiding, which Mark has deduced is the school. John, Sarah, and Sam are attacked by the Mogadorians, who brought two Piken to hunt the trio. They are saved by Number Six and Bernie, who is actually a shapeshifting Chimera sent by John's biological parents to protect him. John and Number Six, who can turn invisible and can block energy attacks, continue to fight the Mogadorians. They eventually defeat them all, including Setrakus Ra. The following day, John and Number Six unite their blue rocks and discover the location of the other four surviving Garde. John lets Sam come with them in hopes of finding Sam's father. They set off to find the others so they can protect Earth from the Mogadorians, leaving Sarah and a repentant Mark, who lies to his father about John's whereabouts. Mark also returns a magic box left to John by his Dad, that was in police evidence. John thanks Mark and promises Sarah that he will come back to her. While they share a goodbye kiss, Mark is visibly resigned to their relationship. John, Sam, Bernie and Number Six drive off, vowing to protect Earth. ==Cast== ==Production== ===Development=== The film was produced by DreamWorks and Reliance Entertainment. Film producer and director Michael Bay brought the manuscript of the young adult novel I Am Number Four to Stacey Snider and Steven Spielberg at DreamWorks. A bidding war developed for the film rights between DreamWorks and J. J. Abrams, with DreamWorks winning the rights in June 2009, with the intention of having Bay produce and possibly direct the project. The rights were purchased with the hope of attracting teenage fans of The Twilight Saga films, and the potential of establishing a film franchise, with at least six more installments planned by the book's publisher. Al Gough and Miles Millar, the creators of the television series Smallville, were hired to write the screenplay in August 2009. Marti Noxon, writer and producer for the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, also contributed to the screenplay. D. J. Caruso was brought on to direct in early 2010, after Bay opted to focus on directing the third film of the Transformers series. Caruso had been selected by Spielberg to direct Disturbia and Eagle Eye for DreamWorks, and had success with both films. Caruso had less than a year to prepare, shoot and edit the film, due to a worldwide release date set for Presidents Day weekend. Chris Bender, J.C. Spink, and David Valdes executive produced the film. Steven Spielberg contributed to the film's characters, but did not take a credit on the film. It was the first DreamWorks film to be released by Disney's Touchstone Pictures label, as part of the 30-picture distribution deal between DreamWorks and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.Variety: Disney signs deal with DreamWorks Company will handle distribution for films, Variety, February 9, 2009 The film was also the first release for DreamWorks after the studio's financial restructuring in 2008. ===Casting=== In March 2010, Alex Pettyfer was in talks to play the title character in the film, Number Four. It was later confirmed that the 21-year- old British actor would play the lead. Sharlto Copley was going to star as Henri, Number Four's guardian and mentor, but had to drop out due to press obligations with his film The A-Team. Copley was replaced by Timothy Olyphant. Kevin Durand plays the villain of the film, Commander, the Mogadorian who leads the hunt for the Loriens on Earth. DreamWorks went through multiple rounds of tests to find the right actress for the female romantic lead. Dianna Agron, a star in the Fox television series Glee, won the role. She plays Sarah Hart, a girl who used to date a high school football player, but falls for Number Four and keeps his secret. Jake Abel plays the football player, Mark James, an antagonist in the film. Teresa Palmer plays the other Loric, Number Six, and 16-year-old Australian actor Callan McAuliffe plays Sam Goode, Number Four's best friend. ===Filming=== Principal photography began on May 17, 2010, using 20 locations all within the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. DreamWorks selected the area primarily due to tax incentives from the Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit. The film studio also had a positive experience shooting She's Out of My League in Pittsburgh in 2008. The production was scheduled to last 12 to 13 weeks. Cinematographer Guillermo Navarro shot the film on 35 mm, using a format known as Super 1:85. Beaver, the former Conley Inn in Homewood, and nearby Buttermilk Falls were used as locations in the film; interior and exterior scenes were shot near a boat launch in Monaca. A spring fair scene was filmed in Deer Lakes Park in West Deer; Port Vue, North Park, New Kensington and Hyde Park were also used as locations. The setting of the film's fictional town of Paradise, Ohio is Vandergrift, Pennsylvania, where filming took place from June to July 2010. Producers chose Vandergrift as the "hero town" of the film because of its unique look and curved streets, laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of New York City's Central Park. Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville was chosen over 50 other schools in the area, due to its proximity to nearby woods, a part of the film's plot, and its surrounding hills. The school was also selected for its one floor layout, wide hallways, and its football stadium in front. Teachers and recent graduates appear in the film, and a set that replicates the school was built in a studio in Monroeville for filming explosion scenes. In the last few weeks of production, scenes were filmed at the 200-year-old St. John's Lutheran Stone Church in Lancaster Township. Additional filming took place in the Florida Keys in the beginning of the film in Big Pine Key, Florida, as well as the spanning of the drive over the bridge showcases the keys 7 mile bridge. ===Post-production=== I Am Number Four was edited by Jim Page, with Industrial Light & Magic developing the visual effects for the alien Pikens. The film was scored by former Yes guitarist Trevor Rabin. ==Release== A teaser trailer for the film was released in late September 2010, and a full-length trailer premiered on December 8. Advertisements ran in Seventeen and Teen Vogue magazines, Disney released a promotional iPhone app in January 2011. Disney also developed Internet content to target a teen audience with their marketing campaign. A cast tour, in association with American retailer Hot Topic, and cast media appearances were scheduled to lead up to the release of the film. I Am Number Four premiered at the Village Theatre in Los Angeles on February 9, 2011. The film was released in theaters on February 18, 2011, and was also released in the IMAX format. ===Home media=== The film was released by Touchstone Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download on May 24, 2011. The release was produced in three different packages: a three-disc Blu- ray, DVD, and "Digital Copy" combo pack, a single-disc Blu-ray, and a single- disc DVD. The "Digital Copy" included with the 3-disc version is a stand-alone disc that allows users to play the film from any location via iTunes or Windows Media Player.

The website's consensus reads, "It's positioned as the start of a franchise, but I Am Number Four familiar plot and unconvincing performances add up to one noisy, derivative, and ultimately forgettable sci- fi thriller." Metacritic gives the film an average score of 36 out of 100 based on reviews from 30 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Empire Magazine gave the film three out of a possible five stars and said, "If you can make it through the bland schmaltz of the first half you'll be rewarded with a spectacular blast of sustained action and the promise of even better to come. This could be the start of something great." ===Box office=== I Am Number Four grossed $55,100,437 at the North American box office and $90,778,000 overseas, for a worldwide total of $149,878,437.

In 2013, director Caruso was asked if there are any possibilities that The Power of Six will get a movie adaption, he replied: "There's been some talk in the past couple of months about trying to do something because there is this audience appetite out there [...]. Most of the people on Twitter that contact me from all over the world ask, "Where's the next movie?" I think DreamWorks is getting those too so it'll be interesting. I don't know if I'd be involved, but I know they're talking about it." Asked about a sequel for the 10th anniversary of the film in 2021, Alex Pettyfer told Screen Rant that DreamWorks scrapped their whole slate of films at the time for funding reasons, suggesting that DreamWorks' blockbusters released during that period had collectively underperformed. ==Cultural impact== The house burning scene was referenced in the Grand Theft Auto V mission "Crystal Maze". ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:2011 films Category:2011 science fiction action films Category:2010s English-language films Category:Alien invasions in films Category:American science fiction action films Category:DreamWorks Pictures films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on science fiction novels Category:Films based on young adult literature Category:Films directed by D.

27837196	I Belong (Kathy Kirby song)	"I Belong" is a song that served as the 's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1965. Its music was written by singer Daniel Boone (credited under his real name, Peter Lee Sterling), and its lyrics were written by Phil Peters. It was performed at Eurovision by Kathy Kirby, where it came in 2nd place, losing to 's "Poupée de cire, poupée de son", performed by France Gall. Kirby also recorded the song as a single, and it peaked on the music charts at No. 36 in Britain and No. 5 in Singapore. ==Lyrics== The song tells of the joy of finding true love for the first time, after a string of bad relationships: :But now my heart has recovered :From past affairs that turned wrong :All my dreams are uncovered :I belong, I belong, I belong ==At Eurovision== The song was performed by Kirby at Eurovision 1965, held in Naples on 21 March 1965. The song was performed second on the night, following the ' "'t Is genoeg" sung by Conny Vandenbos and preceding 's "¡Qué bueno, qué bueno!" sung by Conchita Bautista. By the close of voting, it had received 26 points, placing it 2nd in a field of 18. ==Other versions== Kirby also recorded a version of the song in Italian. ==References== ==External links== * Official Eurovision Song Contest site, history by year, 1965 Category:Eurovision songs of the United Kingdom Category:Eurovision songs of 1965 Category:1965 songs Category:Decca Records singles Category:Songs written by Daniel Boone (singer)
2788624	I Am Woman	"I Am Woman" is a song written by Australian musicians Helen Reddy and Ray Burton. Performed by Reddy, the first recording of "I Am Woman" appeared on her debut album I Don't Know How to Love Him, released in May 1971, and was heard during the closing credits for the 1972 film Stand Up and Be Counted. A new recording of the song was released as a single in May 1972 and became a number-one hit later that year, eventually selling over one million copies. The song came near the apex of the counterculture eraPerrone, James E. (2004). Music of the Counterculture Era. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 85. . and, by celebrating female empowerment, became an enduring feminist anthem for the women’s liberation movement. Following Reddy's death in September 2020, the song peaked at number 2 on the Australian digital sales chart. ==Inspiration for the song== After securing a recording contract in 1971 with Capitol Records that yielded the hit "I Don't Know How to Love Him", Reddy – then living in Los Angeles – was asked for an album. She gave the label a set of 10 jazz-tinged pop songs. Nestled among the Leon Russell, Graham Nash and Van Morrison songs were two Reddy and Ray Burton originals. "I Am Woman" was one of them. The composition was the result of Reddy’s search for a song that would express her growing passion for female empowerment. In a 2003 interview in Australia’s Sunday Magazine (published with the Sunday Herald Sun and Sunday Telegraph),"The Anthem and the Angst", Sunday Magazine, Melbourne Sunday Herald Sun/Sydney Sunday Telegraph, 15 June 2003, Page 16. she explained: Reddy's own long years on stage had also fueled her contempt for men who belittled women, she said. "Women have always been objectified in showbiz. I'd be the opening act for a comic and as I was leaving the stage he'd say, 'Yeah, take your clothes off and wait for me in the dressing room, I'll be right there'. It was demeaning and humiliating for any woman to have that happen publicly." Reddy credits the song as having supernatural inspiration. She said: "I remember lying in bed one night and the words, 'I am strong, I am invincible, I am woman', kept going over and over in my head. That part I consider to be divinely inspired. I had been chosen to get a message across." Pressed on who had chosen her, she replied: "The universe." The next day she wrote the lyric and handed it to Australian guitarist Ray Burton to put it to music. ==Collaboration with Ray Burton== Burton, 26 at the time and playing in Los Angeles with Australian rock band the Executives (and later the founding member of Ayers Rock), was a friend who had often worked with Reddy in live venues across Australia. He has a different recollection of the song's beginning. He told Sunday Magazine that he spoke to Reddy after she hosted a series of regular women's meetings at which he says they would "sit around and whine about their boyfriends". Reddy insists Burton did not change a word of the lyrics. ==Making of the single== Reddy had no expectations for the track. "It clearly was not hit-single material and got no airplay at all. I used it as an opening song whenever I performed live, and it was always well received: I also noticed that the song was being singled out for mention in fan mail."Reddy, Helen (2006). The Woman I Am: A Memoir. Penguin Group. p. 146. . But more than a year later, the song was picked to run behind the opening credits of Stand Up and Be Counted, a lightweight Hollywood women's lib comedy starring Jacqueline Bisset, Loretta Swit and Steve Lawrence. "The decision-makers at Capitol Records thought that, in case the film was a hit, they should release 'I Am Woman' as a single."Reddy, Helen (2006). The Woman I Am: A Memoir. Penguin Group. p. 145. . In its initial form, the original version ran to little more than two minutes, so Reddy was asked to write an additional verse and chorus. The extra verse inserted the song's only reference to men ("Until I make my brother understand"). The recording session for this new version took place on 23 April 1972.(2020) Album notes for I Am Woman/Long Hard Climb by Helen Reddy, [back card]. Watford, UK: Vocalion. Reddy told Sunday Magazine she remembered nothing about it and did not know which musicians played on the song. In fact, she had some of the best LA session musicians backing her: * Mike Deasy: guitar * Jim Horn: woodwind; strings and horns arrangement * Jim Gordon: drums * Michael Melvoin: piano * Leland Sklar: bass * Dick "Slide" Hyde: trombone * Don Menza: saxophone * Kathy Deasy (whose credits included Johnny Rivers, Kenny Loggins and the Byrds): backup vocals Producer Jay Senter assembled the rhythm section at SunWest Studios for a 7:00 p.m. downbeat (start) but since he had planned on tracking without Reddy, she was not told to arrive until 9:00 p.m. Reddy and (then) husband Jeff Wald arrived thinking they were going to track (record) live with the band, but Senter and the band had already recorded the track as well as its intended B-side, "Don't Mess with a Woman". Wald and Reddy were furious in the control room. Senter was clearly not happy, either, and voices were raised, but he did not quit the project. Reddy put her voice on the track that Senter produced, and she and Wald left the studio. That release triggered a five-figure payment to Reddy, which at the time was sorely needed, according to Wald. Immediately after that, guitarist Deasy played the riff on his 12-string electric guitar that became the signature sound for the song. Senter then asked friend and sax man Jim Horn to write string and horn charts to be recorded the following week, while Senter went into the studio with Clydie King, Venetta Fields and Shirley Matthews (the Blossoms) and layered the background vocals. ==Success== As it turned out, "it was the original recording of 'I Am Woman' that was featured on the soundtrack" of the film, which "opened and closed the same week" in May 1972. The new recording of the song was released as a single on the 22nd of the month,(2006) The Woman I Am: The Definitive Collection by Helen Reddy [CD booklet]. Los Angeles: Capitol Records 09463-57613-2-0. and Wald – who had worked the phones for 18 hours a day urging radio stations to play "I Don't Know How to Love Him" – again put his promotional skills to use. He lined up gigs for Reddy – by now heavily pregnant with son Jordan – to sing on 19 TV talk and variety shows, and "women began calling radio stations and requesting the song, thereby forcing airplay."Reddy, Helen (2006). The Woman I Am: A Memoir. Penguin Group. p. 147. . Despite the chord it was striking with television viewers, the song's trek to the top of the charts was still a long, hard climb. It first entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 99 in the issue of the magazine dated 24 June 1972, peaked at number 97 two weeks later, fell off the Hot 100, re-entered at number 87 two months later in the 16 September issue, and reached number one three months later, in the 9 December issue. Upon the release of the single, Record World called it a "typically sensitive, professional performance from the fine Australian songstress." "I Am Woman" was the first number one single for Capitol Records since "Ode to Billie Joe" by Bobbie Gentry five years earlier, in 1967. It was the first number one hit on the Billboard chart by an Australian-born artist and the first Australian-penned song to win a Grammy Award (in her acceptance speech for Best Female Performance, Reddy thanked "God, because She makes everything possible"). It also became the second Helen Reddy hit – after "I Don't Know How to Love Him" – to peak at number two in her native Australia. Overlooked in its original UK release, "I Am Woman" was given a 1975 reissue to serve as the follow-up to Reddy's number five UK hit "Angie Baby" but did not gain enough momentum to reach the UK Top 50. ==Impact and legacy== In the year that Gloria Steinem's Ms. magazine was launched in the US and Cleo in Australia, the song quickly captured the imagination of the burgeoning woman's movement. National Organization for Woman founder Betty Friedan was later to write that in 1973, a gala entertainment night in Washington DC at the NOW annual convention closed with the playing of "I Am Woman". "Suddenly," she said, "women got out of their seats and started dancing around the hotel ballroom and joining hands in a circle that got larger and larger until maybe a thousand of us were dancing and singing, 'I am strong, I am invincible, I am woman.' It was a spontaneous, beautiful expression of the exhilaration we all felt in those years, women really moving as women."Friedan, Betty (1976). It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement. Random House, Inc., p. 257 right|thumb|105px|Betty Friedan, 1960 Some feminists took exception to the lyrics, "I'm still an embryo, with a long, long way to go," identifying the women's liberation movement with a pregnancy. This was particularly true after the 1973 U.S. Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision was bookended by Paul Anka's 1974 number-one hit, "Having My Baby." To Reddy, the song's message reaches beyond feminism. "It's not just for women," she said. "It's a general empowerment song about feeling good about yourself, believing in yourself. When my former brother-in-law, a doctor, was going to medical school he played it every morning just to get him going." In 2002, however, she said, "I had no idea what the song was destined to become. If I'd known, I would have been far too intimidated to have written it." The song brought greater exposure to Reddy, paving the way for a succession of hit singles. It also generated tremendous wealth, which the couple flaunted with a gaudy lifestyle of mansions, limousines, jewelry and speedboats. In her tell-all Hollywood book, You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again, Julia Phillips claimed that by the time the couple completed their acrimonious divorce in 1982 they had blown most of the $40 million they had made.Phillips, Julia (1991). You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again. Random House, Inc. p. 409. . When Reddy’s performance of the song at the 1981 Miss World contest infuriated feminists, she responded: "Let them step forward and pay my rent and I'll stay home. What I'm doing is advertising a product I wouldn't use.""Reddy to sing for the rent", Sunday Telegraph (Sydney), 13 November 1981"Helen still believes, it's just that she has to pay the rent too", by John Burns of the Daily Express, reprinted in Melbourne Herald, 16 December 1981 Reddy had been quoted as saying, "To this day I get mail from women who say, I went to law school because of your song. But I would hate to think out of the wide spectrum of things I have done in my career, that's all I would be remembered for." But in her autobiography, The Woman I Am: A Memoir, she recalls a 2000 encounter with a friend's high-school-aged nephew who said that "in his assigned Modern American History textbook, in a section on the rise of feminism in the 70s, I was mentioned along with the printed lyrics to 'I Am Woman'."Reddy, Helen (2006). The Woman I Am: A Memoir. Penguin Group. p. 321. . It became her excuse for what, in 2002, she called her retirement: "I thought, 'Well, I'm part of history now. And how do I top that? I can't top that.' So, it was an easy [decision to stop singing]." But in a 2014 interview celebrating her return to the stage, Ernie Manouse asked about the song, "Ever regret it because it's so iconic? Does it overshadow everything else? Because people forget how many hit songs you had, and yet this song becomes so big. Is it ever too much to have on your back?" Reddy begins, "No, no," and after a pause says, "I'm proud of it." The song's opening line, "I am woman, hear me roar" has become widely referenced in media. In a 1975 episode of The Carol Burnett Show, guest Jean Stapleton played a feminist who proudly announces, "I am woman!" to which Harvey Korman's character replies, "I know. I heard your roar." During the 2000 Republican presidential campaign of Elizabeth Dole one GOP consultant complained that, "she has to have a message beyond 'I am woman, hear me roar.'"Waldman, Tom (2003). We All Want to Change the World: Rock and Politics from Elvis to Eminem. Taylor Trade Publishing. p. 197. . A biopic of Reddy's life, titled after the song, was announced in mid-2016 with Unjoo Moon as director, and finally saw release in 2020. At the 2020 ARIA Music Awards held in late November, the song was performed in tribute to the late Reddy by an ensemble of Australian female singers. They were introduced by former Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and were backed by a virtual choir of more than twenty female singers. ==Fallout with Burton== Expelled from the US in 1971 because of work-permit problems, Ray Burton watched the song's rise in the US from a distance. Burton ended up living on unemployment benefits. "It could have been the launching pad for a writing and singing career," he said. "They took advantage of the fact I wasn't there." He claimed he was forced to take legal action against the singer in 1998 to recover a portion of songwriter royalties that had been withheld from him since 1972. He said: "I got some money out of it, but nothing like it would have been in the '70s when it was riding high." Reddy disputes Burton's claims. "There was a buyout 25 or 30 years ago," she told Sunday Magazine. "Neither of us had any idea the song would become what it became. About 10 years ago he got in touch with me because he was in financial difficulties. I felt sorry for him and reinstated his songwriter royalties. His passport problems ended any hope he had of a career in the States and somehow that bitterness got transferred to me. I wish him well. I bear him no animosity." Today he performs again in venues on the Queensland Gold Coast, where he lives. Sometimes he includes it in his set, raising a laugh from audiences by saying, "Here's a song I wrote in the '70s, with a twist." He sings it as, "She is woman, hear her roar". ==In popular culture== Reddy's description of the "typical DJ reaction" to the song is quoted in The Billboard Book of Number One Hits: 'I can't stand this record! I hate this song! But you know, it's a funny thing, my wife loves it!'Bronson, Fred (2003). The Billboard Book of Number One Hits. Billboard Books. p. 324. . During the Audience Talent Show Night segment of the episode of Late Show with David Letterman dated 20 April 1995, Reddy was seated in the back of the audience and asked by Letterman what her talent was. She replied, "Hit it, Paul," as she took the mic from Letterman's hand and began singing "I Am Woman." The audience responded enthusiastically as the host cut to a commercial, but Reddy interrupted at several points throughout the show in different locations to break into her signature song: first in the window behind Letterman's desk and then during an interview with Nicolas Cage, a supposed commercial, and a performance by Blues Traveler. Whenever the music cut off and she was dismissed from the stage, she would always smile, wave and say, "Thank you." In 2006, Burger King released an ad campaign titled "Manthem" featuring "I Am Man", a parody of Helen Reddy's song, to promote its Texas Double Whopper hamburger.C.

In the modern Japanese system of sound order, it occupies the second position of the syllable chart, between あ and う. Additionally, it is the first letter in Iroha, before ろ. Both represent the sound . In the Ainu language, katakana イ is written as y in their Latin-based syllable chart, and a small ィ after another katakana represents a diphthong.

28015937	I Am Not a Human Being	I Am Not a Human Being is the eighth studio album by the American rapper Lil Wayne. It had a digital release on September 27, 2010, and on compact disc on October 12, 2010, by Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Universal Motown. It was recorded before Wayne's eight-month prison term for criminal possession of a weapon. Production for the album was by Wayne and several record producers, including Boi-1da, Cool & Dre, Streetrunner, Noah "40" Shebib and DJ Infamous. Upon its release, I Am Not a Human Being received generally positive reviews from music critics, who drew comparisons to Wayne's earlier works and considered the album to be an improvement over his previous album, Rebirth. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week digital sales alone. Following its physical release, it topped the chart, becoming Wayne's second US number-one album and the first studio album since Tupac's Me Against the World in 1995 to reach the top position on the Billboard 200 while its artist was in prison. Its lead single, "Right Above It", became a top-ten hit in the United States. The album has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). ==Background== On August 4, 2010, Billboard announced that Lil Wayne would release an EP called I Am Not a Human Being and a single from the EP called "Right Above It". The single debuted on DJ Funkmaster Flex's show, which Lil Wayne called and gave an interview. The album is a prelude to Lil Wayne's album Tha Carter IV. Drake, Jay Sean, Lil Twist, Nicki Minaj, Jae Millz, Tyga, Gudda Gudda, Lil Chuckee and T-Streets are all guests on the album. Vibe magazine spoke with the DJ Scoob Doo about Tha Carter IV and I Am Not a Human Being, who said, "I got videos for the Carter IV and the I’m not a Human Being EP all ready. I can’t say the name of the song but Wayne was singing on the hook, but they’re getting Drake to re-do it and it’s off the Human Being EP,” Scoob Doo says. “Carter IV is probably the best album I’ve heard in the last decade, but Wayne is such a different artist now that he wants to record new music when he comes home. The stuff he’s talking about now is just on another level. That’s why a lot of the songs on the EP were originally taken from the Carter IV.” Lil Wayne's manager Cortez Bryant told SPIN that I Am Not a Human Being would actually be a full-length album. Initially, the tracks were to be appear on Tha Carter IV, but Wayne decided to put the old tracks on the album so new music could be recorded for Tha Carter IV. \- He uses no autotune on the album: according to Birdman, it's just "raw rap". The production to bonus track "YM Salute" was originally recorded by Young Jeezy and Ester Dean as potential material for Young Jeezy's forthcoming album TM 103. The song "I Don't Like The Look Of It" was originally released on Gudda Gudda's 2010 mixtape "Back 2 Guddaville" with a different beat under the title "Willy Wonka". The instrumental was changed when it was released on this album due to sample clearance issues. ==Release and promotion== The last three tracks featured on the album's physical CD release, "YM Banger", "YM Salute", and "I Don't Like The Look Of It", were not initially included on the digital download version of the album: however, after the physical CD version was released, the tracks were added to the digital version of the album. The album's lead single, "Right Above It" featuring Drake, was released to iTunes on August 17, 2010. The song debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and at number one on the Billboard Hot Digital Songs chart. "What's Wrong With Them" received strong download sales in the UK during the album's release and as such, the track charted on the UK R&B; Chart, peaking at number 27. ==Critical reception== I Am Not a Human Being received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 17 reviews. Allmusics David Jeffries stated, "This is too short and scattered to put on his top shelf, but it comes awfully close, which is downright astonishing considering the circumstances."Jeffries, David (October 4, 2010).

Uncut gave the album four stars out of five and called it "a far superior effort [than Rebirth]." Billboard gave it a score of 77 out of 100 and said it was "not as experimental as the rapper's previous rock-tinged "Rebirth" set that arrived earlier this year, and most fans will likely appreciate this." Wilson McBee of Prefix Magazine gave the album a score of 7.5 out of ten and said that "For most of [the album], it seems like Wayne has forgotten how to write a verse. He's all about couplets now."

Sean L. Maloney of American Songwriter gave the album two-and- a-half stars out of five and said of Lil Wayne, "he's just killing time with sub-par versions of his far more popular songs – this is a completely superfluous release that lacks the relevance and immediacy of his mixtape works and the quality-control of his albums." ==Commercial performance== I Am Not a Human Being debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 110,000 digital copies in its first week.

In its analysis and review, nonfiction.fr wrote: "Benjamin Rassat poses an ironic contemporary society, focusing on three fundamental aspects: the power of media, the "narcissistic temptation" renewed by the computer age, and the staging of multiple identities seeking to assert their existence in the insubstantial fabric of the net in a time of disillusionment and loneliness".

2813962	I Can't Tell You Why	"I Can't Tell You Why" is a song by the American rock band Eagles that appeared on their 1979 album The Long Run. It was written by band members Timothy B. Schmit, Glenn Frey and Don Henley. Recorded in March 1978, it was the first song finished for the album and the first Eagles song to feature Schmit on lead vocals. Released as a single in February 1980, it became a Billboard top 10 hit in April, reaching number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the Adult Contemporary chart. It was the group's last top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Background== Timothy B. Schmit provided the song title and composed the nucleus of "I Can't Tell You Why," which he then presented to Glenn Frey and Don Henley and they completed the song together. Henley described the finished song as "straight Al Green" and said that Frey, an R&B; fan from Detroit, was responsible for the R&B; feel of the song. Frey said to Schmit: "You could sing like Smokey Robinson. Let's not do a Richie Furay, Poco-sounding song. Let's do an R&B; song." Schmit describes the song as "loosely based on my own experiences." Schmit said: "I had some writing sessions with Don and Glenn and I threw out a bunch of my ideas and that one [for "I Can't Tell You Why"] stuck. I had [composed] a pretty good part of it, not a huge part but enough for them to think 'That could be good' and go with it. So Don, Glenn and I finished it over a few all night sessions." He also said, "When it was being developed in the studio...I knew it was a great song. I [thought] 'Yes! This is an amazing debut for me.' When we finally mixed it, we had a little listening party at the studio. As people were hearing it, Don turned to me and said, 'There's your first hit.'" Schmit sang the lead vocals, with Frey and Henley singing counterpoint. Schmit also played the bass on the track, which has a distinctive riff believed by Schmit to have been devised by Frey. According to Henley, Frey wrote the counterpoint part. In 1980, the band promoted the song with a music video featuring Schmit on bass guitar accompanied by Frey on the electric piano, although Frey recorded the guitar solos on the recording, with Henley on drums, Don Felder on electric guitar, Joe Walsh on organ and Walsh's touring sideman Joe Vitale on ARP string synthesizer. Live versions of the song were released on the 1980 album Eagles Live and 1994's Hell Freezes Over. Schmit also performed "I Can't Tell You Why" while on tour as a member of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band in 1992. Their performance of the song was included on the 1993 live album Ringo Starr and His All Starr Band Volume 2: Live from Montreux. ==Reception== Cash Box said that "Schmit’s aching, near-falsetto vocal here adds immeasurable depth to the haunting quality of this love song, with a tastefully sparse instrumental." Record World said that "Tim Schmidt, the newest Eagle, lends his sweet falsetto and writing talents to this pretty love ballad." In 2017, Billboard ranked the song number six on its list of the 15 greatest Eagles songs, In 2019, Rolling Stone ranked the song number 11 on its list of the 40 greatest Eagles songs. Ultimate Classic Rock critic Sterling Whitaker rated it as the Eagles 5th most underrated song, praising Schmit's "beautiful falsetto" and Frey's "melodic" guitar solo. == Track listing == *7" single (45-1965/AS 12.418/K 12418/E-46608) *7" promo (E-46608) ==Covers== * In 1990, R&B; singer Howard Hewett covered "I Can't Tell You Why" which is on his Very Best of Howard Hewett album.

2821988	I Bet You Will	I Bet You Will is an Internet webcast, and later a show on MTV that paid people to do outrageous things for money. In 2008, reruns of the program began to air on Spike. It was created by Morgan Spurlock. The show was hosted by Spurlock, musician/TV host/model Willa Ford, musician Jive Jones, comedian Godfrey, and Hescher. ==Format== The host selected a participant from a seemingly random group gathered on a street, at the beach, or on a college campus. The M.C. (Master of Ceremonies) then presented the stunt and told the player how much money they would win if the dare was successfully completed. If the contestant rejected the amount of money, the host usually raised the bet. As soon as a bet was agreed upon, the player attempted the stunt. If successful, the contestant won the money. If unsuccessful, they won nothing except for what was collected in a "pity jar" by audience members watching. On several occasions, if a participant did not agree to a bet, the host would ask if someone else in the audience would do it for a "Stolen Bet" of the same amount of money offered to the original participant. Several segments were shown per episode, the end of which usually showed the contestant saying "I Bet You Will..." followed by the name of the stunt or the thing the contestant had to do. ==Dares== Dares used on I Bet You Will included the following: * Eating or drinking a concoction of gross items or rotten food a la Fear Factor (cod liver oil was a staple of the show) * Enduring public humiliation for a fixed period of time, usually involving being covered in a disgusting substance and/or being stripped totally naked to nearly naked (such as having to wear a thong with udders, getting painted as a cow, and eating wheat grass) * Having unusual things done to one's hair or body (for example, getting a mullet or having one eyebrow shaved off) * Having a prized possession (such as a wallet, university degree or car) damaged, destroyed, or otherwise irreplaceably taken away - this was sometimes paired with a stunt which if lost meant that the player lost the possession and got nothing in return * Having one's money shredded, placed in a bowl, and mixed with a gross food, which the contestant then had to eat for a bigger payoff * Being blindfolded while receiving tattoos of someone else's choice anywhere on the body. * Being waxed in public. * Sitting nude in public and letting strangers pour anything they wanted on them. *Letting strangers draw on a person's body with permanent markers. * Asking for wedgies and getting paid a fixed amount per wedgie. * Rolling dice, spinning a wheel, or grabbing a rubber duckie and doing the stunt on a fixed bet. * Getting someone to stomp guacamole with their feet and having someone else lick it off. * Getting someone to walk barefoot through city streets and having another person lick the dirt off their soles. Occasionally, bonuses were offered if a player could complete or endure a second dare while performing the first one; failure to complete such a dare sometimes caused the player to fail the first one and lose everything. The host also occasionally offered to double the bet on the condition that the contestant ate two or three more things, performed a dare naked or allowed his or her best friend to aid in the humiliation. Now I Bet You Will is aired in Latin America on VH1. ==External links== * Official Website * Spike Official Website Category:MTV original programming Category:MTV game shows Category:American game shows Category:2000s game shows Category:2002 American television series debuts Category:2002 American television series endings

Like its predecessor, "i" was released to moderate sales figures and topped the UK independent charts. ==Reviews== In a mixed 1990 review, critic Greg Tate stated that the album "seems both more rudimentary and more calculating by comparison with the organic and uncontrived otherness of 69," noting their incorporation of "various received rock, reggae, and house song-forms" and opining that "the results are spotty." The AllMusic review by Jason Ankeny called the album "breathtaking in its scope and positively epic in its ambition," and concluded that, "largely overlooked upon its original release, i is still an underappreciated masterpiece." ==Track listing== == Personnel == *A.R.

2867531	I Can Only Imagine (MercyMe song)	"I Can Only Imagine" is a song by Christian rock band MercyMe. Written and composed by lead singer Bart Millard, it was originally recorded for the band's 1999 independent album The Worship Project before being included on their 2001 major-label debut album Almost There. The song was the last to be written for The Worship Project; in writing it, Millard drew upon his thoughts about his father's death. Lyrically, it imagines what it would be like to be in front of God in heaven; it opens with just a piano before building to include guitar and drums. After being released on October 12, 2001, as the second single from Almost There, "I Can Only Imagine" became a major success on Christian radio; it spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Radio & Records Christian AC chart and became the most-played Christian single of 2002. It became an unexpected mainstream hit in 2003, peaking at No. 71 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 5 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart while also hitting top 40, adult top 40, and country radio charts. The song returned to the charts after its story was adapted into a 2018 film of the same name, peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard Christian Songs chart and No. 10 on the Billboard Digital Songs chart. "I Can Only Imagine" received positive reviews from critics. Particular praise was given to its lyrics, and some critics called it the best song on Almost There. It received the Dove Awards for Song of the Year and Pop/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year at the 33rd GMA Dove Awards, also garnering Millard the award for Songwriter of the Year; he also won the Songwriter of the Year award at the 25th American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Christian Music Awards. In 2004, CCM Magazine ranked it as the fourth-best song in Christian music, and it has since become the most-played song in the history of Christian radio as well as the best-selling Christian song of all time; it has been certified five-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and as of April 2018, it has sold over 2.5 million copies. ==Background and recording== thumb|alt=MercyMe performing in a concert.|MercyMe's lead singer and songwriter, Bart Millard (left), is credited with writing or co-writing most of the songs on the album. MercyMe was formed in 1994 by vocalist Bart Millard, guitarist Mike Scheuchzer, and keyboardist Jim Bryson. The band later brought on drummer Robby Shaffer and bassist Nathan Cochran. In their early years, they independently released four Christian alternative rock albums, drawing influence from the grunge style of rock music popular at the time. However, they realized that their original songs from these albums failed to connect with their audiences while their covers of popular worship songs were much more popular. Because of this, the band decided to write and produce an album of original worship songs. This album, The Worship Project, utilized a simple verse–chorus format designed to easily fit on a PowerPoint screen. In the last phases of production, MercyMe needed one more song to include on the album. Late at night on the band's bus, Millard found an old notebook with the phrase "I can only imagine" written in it. He began to write a song, basing it on his personal feelings about his father Arthur's death. Early in Bart's life, Arthur had been physically and emotionally abusive towards his family, with Bart being beaten severely at points; Arthur and his wife Adele eventually divorced, and Bart was sent to live with his mother after an especially extreme whipping. Bart kept in contact with his father, however, who was later diagnosed with pancreatic cancer when Bart was 15. His father began to make amends for his actions and started becoming more religiously observant, reading the Bible and going to church regularly. As Arthur progressively became more ill, his relationship with his son improved dramatically; by the time Arthur died in 1991, when Bart was 18, the two were very close. Millard said that "I got a front row seat to see this guy go from being a monster to falling desperately in love with Jesus. By the time he passed away when I was a freshman in college, not only was he my best friend, he was like the Godliest man I’d ever known". After Arthur's death, Bart became obsessed with the phrase "I can only imagine" after hearing his grandmother say that she could only imagine what Arthur was seeing in heaven. Millard found comfort in the thought and began to write it on anything he could find. Once Millard started writing the song, he estimated that it took him only about ten minutes to write the lyrics. Millard said that it was one of the few songs he had ever written where there were not any mistakes in the writing process; "it was just written the way it is and left at that". MercyMe initially attempted to record "I Can Only Imagine" as a fast song, but after several failed attempts, Millard talked with Bryson about arranging it into a slower version. As the band was tearing down the equipment in their recording studio, Bryson began playing a piano intro. Millard immediately decided to use the intro, and the rest of the song was completed in around five minutes. Although the rest of the band did not see how it would fit on the record, as it didn't meet the basic verse-chorus format the rest of the album had, they felt it needed to be included on it because it meant so much to Millard. The Worship Project was released on October 14, 1999. Sales for the album far exceeded the band's previous efforts; Millard estimated the album's overall sales at 100,000, which other sources peg the album's sales as of 2006 at 60,000 or 65,000 copies. The difficulty of meeting sales demands when selling the album directly, in addition to having to book and manage for themselves, led the band to pursue a contract with a record label; MercyMe would sign with INO Records in 2000. "I Can Only Imagine" was one of several songs from the band's independent records that were selected to be included on their debut album with INO, Almost There (2001). ==Composition== "I Can Only Imagine" is set in the key of E major and has a tempo of 80 beats per minute. Bart Millard's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of G5. Note: To access archive, user must click 'bypass' and then, on the next screen, click 'please click here'. Millard is credited with writing and composing the song. A contemporary Christian and pop song, "I Can Only Imagine" has been considered both a ballad and a power ballad. The song opens up with only a piano, building up to include guitar and drums. The song has a directly Christian message; its religious lyrics weren't edited for mainstream radio. In the song, the narrator wonders what it would be like to stand before God in heaven. In the refrain, the singer ponders "Will I dance for You Jesus/or in awe of you be still/Will I stand in Your presence or to my knees will I fall/Will I sing hallelujah/will I be able to speak at all/I can only imagine/I can only imagine". Regarding the lyrical theme of "I Can Only Imagine", Millard explained to Fox News that "I was always told that if [my father] could choose, he would rather be in Heaven than here with me. As a Christian I believed that, but as an 18-year-old it was a little hard to swallow. So the questions in the song came from me asking God what was so great about Him that my dad would rather be there." ==Critical reception== Critical reception for "I Can Only Imagine" was positive. Steve Losey of AllMusic praised it as being "passionate" and "emotionally compelling". Kevin Chamberlin of Jesus Freak Hideout said the song's lyrics were "amazing". It was called the "definite highlight" of Almost There by New Release Tuesday's Kevin McNeese, who also praised its piano intro, saying it "instantly invokes chills", as well as the song's lyrical content. Charisma writer Margaret Feinburg lauded the song's "heart-gripping" lyrics, and it was cited as the centerpiece of the album by Megumi Nakamura of Cross Rhythms, who called it "beautiful and touching". Writing for CCM Magazine, Adam Woodroof described the song as "heavenly" and said it was the highlight of Almost There. Although Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today called it "beautiful and inspiring", he questioned if "I Can Only Imagine" was actually a worship song. At the 33rd GMA Dove Awards in 2002, I Can Only Imagine" earned the GMA Dove Awards for Pop/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year and Song of the Year. Note: Search for either MercyMe or Bart Millard. Millard won the award for Songwriter of the Year at the same ceremony as well as at the 25th American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Christian Music Awards, held on June 2, 2003. In 2004, CCM Magazine ranked "I Can Only Imagine" as the fourth- greatest song in Christian music. ===Legacy=== "I Can Only Imagine" has been regarded as MercyMe's "breakthrough hit" as well as their signature song. It is the most-played song in the history of Christian radio and one of the most- played songs in the history of contemporary music. As of April 2018, it is the best-selling Christian song of all-time. It has consistently ranked among the best-selling Christian digital songs each year in the Billboard year-end charts, ranging from number 19 in 2016 to number three in 2018. It is often requested to be played at funerals. "I Can Only Imagine" was named the official inspirational song for the state of Oklahoma in 2018; the measure was passed by the Oklahoma Legislature and signed by Governor Mary Fallin. The story behind "I Can Only Imagine" was adapted into a film. Directed by the Erwin Brothers and starring J. Michael Finley as Bart Millard and Dennis Quaid as Arthur Millard, the movie was released to theaters on March 16, 2018. It received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and exceeded initial expectations at the box office, grossing $17.1 million in its opening week. This was the fourth best-ever opening for a faith-based film, behind only The Passion of the Christ, Son of God, and Heaven Is for Real. The film finished its theatrical run having grossed $83.4 million in the United States and Canada and $1.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $85.2 million. As of August 2019, it ranks as the fifth-highest grossing music biopic of all-time in the United States (behind Bohemian Rhapsody, Straight Outta Compton, Walk the Line, and Rocketman) and was the highest-grossing independent film of 2018. ==Release and promotion== thumb|upright=0.8|Amy Grant, originally given the rights to release "I Can Only Imagine" as a single, gave the rights back to MercyMe in 2001. She later released her version of "I Can Only Imagine" in 2002, pairing it in a medley with "Sing the Wondrous Love of Jesus".|alt=Standing, Grant sings into a microphone while playing an acoustic guitar. Originally, "I Can Only Imagine" was set to be released by fellow Christian artist Amy Grant. Millard had initially declined a request from Grant's record label to allow her to record the song; some segments of the Christian community had reacted negatively to her divorce, and Millard wasn't sure if he wanted to be involved. After consulting with his pastor, who felt Millard should accept the opportunity, he began to reconsider, and finally agreed to let her cover it after talking with Grant over the phone. Grant had planned to release her version of the song as the lead single from her upcoming album and MercyMe would release a different song as their first single, hoping to capitalize on having written what would presumably become a major hit for Grant. The band released their first single from Almost There, "Bless Me Indeed (Jabez's Song)", which performed poorly at Christian radio, leading to poor sales of the album. Plans were made to release another single from the record, but the band's manager, Scott Brickell, decided to reach out to Grant to see if she still planned to release her version as a single. Grant gave MercyMe her blessing to release the song as a single and signed the rights back to the band; "I Can Only Imagine" was released on October 12, 2001, as the album's second single. The song debuted on the Christian AC chart on November 2, 2001, reached the No. 1 position on February 22, 2002,The following sources confirm peak positions for each single on the Radio & Records Christian AC chart: * * and spent two weeks at the top spot. It also peaked at No. 15 on the Radio & Records Christian CHR chart. The song became the most-played song on Christian radio in 2002. As a result of its success on radio, Almost There experienced a "surge" in sales, debuting on the Billboard 200 in December 2001 and entering the top ten on the Christian Albums chart in January 2002. The song stayed on Christian radio for so long that plans to release a third single from Almost There were cancelled, with the band instead beginning work on a new album. In 2003, a Dallas mainstream radio station, 100.3 Wild-FM, played the song on its morning show, The Fitz Radio Program. They had responded to a caller's repeated requests and the urgings of the program's producer, Todd Sheppard, a former seminary student. Although it had been played almost as joke, it soon became the most requested and most played song on the station. After hearing the song played on the station, Millard called-in and spoke with the crew, and MercyMe then came in and played the song live. Big Gay Steven, one of the show's hosts, described their audience's response to the song as "overwhelming". As other mainstream stations around the country began to play the song, MercyMe's label, INO Records, partnered with Curb Records to market the single to mainstream radio. Its initial success was seen as surprising due to its overtly religious themes, although several other Christian artists had begun achieving mainstream success at the same time, including Stacie Orrico, whose singles "Stuck" and "(There's Gotta Be) More to Life" had both hit the Billboard Hot 100. Curb began to promote the song to adult contemporary and Top 40 radio, and INO and Curb released a double A-side physical single, "I Can Only Imagine/Word of God Speak", in September 2003. "I Can Only Imagine" debuted on the Adult Contemporary chart on May 23, 2003, eventually peaking at No. 5 for the chart week of September 8, 2003. "I Can Only Imagine" spent 30 weeks on the chart. The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 for the chart week of October 11, 2003 at No. 76. The song peaked at No. 71 and spent 16 non- consecutive weeks on the chart. "I Can Only Imagine" also peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales chart, a component chart of the Billboard Hot 100 that ranks the best-selling physical single releases, for 10 weeks. During the week of November 22, 2003, it became the first No. 1 physical single to be outsold by the highest-selling digital single of the week; for that week, "I Can Only Imagine" sold 7,500 physical copies in the United States while Outkast's "Hey Ya!" sold 8,500 digital downloads. The song also charted on the Mainstream Top 40, Adult Top 40, and Country Songs charts. In 2012, "I Can Only Imagine" appeared on France's Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) chart, spending two weeks and peaking at No. 65. In March 2018, following the release of the film I Can Only Imagine, which was based on the song's story, it appeared on the Billboard Christian Songs chart; because the chart had been created after the song's original run on Christian radio, it was eligible to chart for the first time. It debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Christian Songs chart and also spent a third week at No. 1 on the Billboard Christian Digital Songs chart; the song had spent 425 weeks on the chart at that point, the longest run of any song in the chart's history. "I Can Only Imagine" peaked at No. 1 on the Christian Songs chart on March 31, 2018, and spent three weeks at the top spot. It also peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Digital Songs chart and ranked at No. 8 on the 2018 year-end Christian Songs chart. In April 2010, "I Can Only Imagine" was certified platinum by the RIAA, signifying sales of over 1 million digital downloads. Note: Requires user to input artist, e.g. MercyMe. It was the first single by any artist in the Christian music genre to go platinum. The song was certified double platinum in September 2014, triple platinum in June 2018, and quadruple platinum in September 2019. As of March 2018, it has sold 2.5 million copies, making it the best-selling Christian single of all time. ==Music video== thumb|right|Millard holding his father's photograph in the music video.|alt=Sitting on stairs, Bart Millard holds up a picture frame of his father Arthur A music video was released for "I Can Only Imagine". Note: video may not be available in your region, e.g. Australia. According to Millard, the video's inspiration came from seeing people holding empty picture frames at their concerts, symbolizing their deceased loved ones. Millard said that the "I've had so many people after a show pull out a picture of someone they've lost. These people embrace these photos and I just thought how can we tap into that". The video features everyday people as well as several music artists including Michael Tait, Tammy Trent, Bob Herdman, and Jesse Katina, each holding an empty picture frame to signify their loss of a loved one; as the video progresses, they are holding pictures of their loved ones including Millard with his father's photograph. ==Live performances== Despite including "I Can Only Imagine" on The Worship Project, MercyMe initially did not perform the song in concerts because they felt it did not fit with the rest of the record. The band's first performance of the song did not come until the summer after the release of The Worship Project at a summer camp at the request of a camp counselor. The band has played the song at every show since as of February 2009 MercyMe's 2004 concert tour (the Imagine Tour) and 201819 tour (the Imagine Nation Tour) both took their name from the song. MercyMe performed "I Can Only Imagine" at the 33rd GMA Dove Awards, with an accompanying "inspiring video that underscored the emotional and inspirational power of song". The band also performed the song at the 40th GMA Dove Awards, held on April 23, 2009, in a medley with "Finally Home". At the 2017 National Prayer Breakfast, MercyMe performed the song with President Donald Trump in attendance.

28718973	I Am the Ripper	I Am the Ripper is a 2004 action horror documentary-style film directed by François Gaillard, under the pseudonym Eric Anderson. ==Plot== At a crowded apartment party, sultry goth-punk Raphaëlle is pawed by a male guest whom she kicks in the eye in response. When he goes to the bathroom to check his injury, he's attacked and murdered by a mysterious Death like figure in a cloak and skull mask. His body is discovered by a girl whom the killer promptly decapitates, tossing her head into the middle of the living room which throws the crowd into a panic. The stranger wades through the partygoers, skewering heads and slashing away until the guests have either fled or perished. Raphaëlle stays behind and challenges the killer to fight. Meanwhile, the rest of the survivors split up and run to find help, but somehow keep finding themselves back in the apartment. They find Raphaëlle and discover that she had been possessed and transformed into a hellish she-demon. The slaughter continues as the killer hunts down the remaining survivors. They gain control of one of the killer's guns and start shooting, to no avail. One of the survivors, Peter, continues to search for Raphaëlle. Instead he finds the killer who is revealed to be Death. He gains control of the gun and another gunfight ensues. When the bullets run out, Death beats Peter and gives him a glimpse into Hell. Death decides to spare Peter's life for the moment, as Peter had been able to fight him off the longest. Death then proposes a challenge: a fight, with the winner keeping Peter's soul. Death gives Peter 24 hours to rest up and train for the fight and cautions him regarding the consequences should he try to cheat Death in any way. Peter decides to take his fate into his own hands, and puts a pistol to his head. What he sees next is all of his dead friends who take him to a club where the rules of the afterlife are explained to him. There is a small "entrance exam" given by their new employer, during which the candidate must take the life of someone he loved while he was alive. Peter's target is easily identified, and not wanting their "contracts cancelled" his friends tag along to ensure that all goes well. Joining them is another friend from the party who reveals that he is an angel, sent down as an arbiter for the events that come to pass when Death walks among the living. ==Cast== * Nicholas Tary - Peter * Nicholas Verdoux - Nico * Fabien Félicité - Sam * Kim N'Guyen-Duy (credited as Kim N'Duy) * Yann Joseph * Alexandre Guégan * Ulrich Waselinck * Kae Nagakura * Cécile Guérineau * Ilona Patai * Aurélie Godefroy * Raphaël Griot * Nichaolas Yepes * Frédéric Lastaevel * Gilles Landucci * Michel Verger Laurent * Lisa Nougier ==Reception== I Am the Ripper has received a negative critical reception.

28750274	I Corps Observation Group	The I Corps Observation Group was a United States Army Air Service unit that fought on the Western Front during World War I as part of the Air Service, First United States Army. It was demobilized in France after the 1918 Armistice with Germany on 15 April 1919. There is no modern United States Air Force or Air National Guard unit that shares its lineage and history. ==Mission== The mission of the group was primarily to keep the friendly command informed of the general situation within the enemy lines by means of visual and photographic reconnaissances. It was called upon to effect, whenever necessary, the adjustment of U.S. Army artillery fire. In addition, it was expected that the group would serve to complete the schooling of pilots and observers and render them more competent to undertake intensive operations elsewhere on a larger and more complete scale. ==History== Organized in April 1918 as 1st Corps Observation Group. The assigned 1st Aero Squadron was the first American air unit to ever see action in France, being the same unit which served under General John J. Pershing as part of the Pancho Villa Expedition while chasing Pancho Villa into Mexico in 1916. Assigned to the I Corps, United States Army Air Service, First United States Army. Commenced active operations over the front occupied by the 26th Division, United States Army, between Flirey and Apremont on that portion of the front known as the Toul sector. The pilots of these squadrons, with one or two exceptions, had never before flown in combat. The group and squadron commanders were in every case men of long experience in training work but had never flown to an appreciable extent under war conditions. The mission of the group was primarily to keep the friendly command informed of the general situation within the enemy lines by means of visual and photographic reconnaissances. It was called upon to effect, whenever necessary, the adjustment of our own artillery fire. In addition, it expected that the group would serve to complete the schooling of pilots and observers and render them more competent to undertake intensive operations elsewhere on a larger and more complete scale. ===Lineage=== * Organized in France as: I Corps Observation Group, 21 April 1918 : Demobilized in France on 15 April 1919 ===Assignments=== * Headquarters Air Service, I Corps, First Army, 21 April 1918 – 15 April 1919 ===Components=== * 1st Aero Squadron (Corps Observation), 4 April– 18 November 1918 * 12th Aero Squadron (Corps Observation), 30 April 1918 – 18 November 1918 * 88th Aero Squadron (Corps Observation), 28 May 1918 - 25 July 1918 * 50th Aero Squadron (Corps Observation), 8 September 1918 – 1 April 1919 * Photographic Section No. 1, Apr–Nov 1918 * Escadrille BR 211, Aéronautique Militaire (Attached), June-Nov 1918The N 211 arrives in the area at the beginning of June ===Stations=== * Ourches Aerodrome, France, 21 April 1918 * Saints Aerodrome, France, 29 June 1918 * Francheville Aerodrome, 6 July 1918 * Ferme de Moras Aerodrome (near La Ferté-sous-Jouarre) France, 30 July 1918 * May-en-Multien Aerodrome, France, 5 August 1918 * Coincy Aerodrome, France, 10 August 1918 * Chailly-en-Brie Aerodrome, France, 12 August 1918 * Croix de Metz Aerodrome (Toul), France, 22 August 1918 * Remicourt Aerodrome, France, 20 September 1918 * Julvecourt Aerodrome, France, 5 November 1918 – 15 April 1919 ==See also== * Organization of the Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force ==Notes== ==References== * Series "D", Volume 2, List of Air Service Units Assigned to Tactical Operations and Table Showing Change of Stations for Air Service Units assigned to Armies before 11 November 1918.

The plot has the protagonist Chotu being sent to a dhaba to work and earn for the family. Here, he befriends the royal heir, Rannvijay, of a neighbouring resort's owner, who's his age. Ranvijay's character showcase that money, royal blood, luxury is a privilege but do not contribute towards happiness and joy childhood demands.A beautiful character of modern thoughts has been portrayed through Ranavijay who doesn't believe in caste system and protest against restricted education for the underprivileged. Moreover, the friendship between Chotu and Ranvijay glorify the importance of having a true friend in life. Every day, Chotu dreams of wearing a tie and uniform to go to school, just like Rannvijay, as he has an unusual thirst for education and knowledge.

As the story progresses, he meets a foreigner woman who tries to convince his mother to let him study as he is a bright kid, but since the family's circumstances aren't in favour, he is denied an education. As a consequence, Chotu aka Kalam decides to run away to Delhi to meet the President and give him a letter. In this, he writes about how he wants to become like the President of India and thanks Dr. Kalam for making him realise his dreams. Meanwhile, every one from his family comes running after Chotu to find him in the new city. They finally track him down and a relieved Rannvijay and zealous Chotu hug each other with joy.

It was released on November 26, 2010 through Parkwood Entertainment, Music World Entertainment and Columbia Records. Beyoncé produced, directed and edited the concert film for her own production company Parkwood Pictures. It was filmed in the presence of more than a million fans during her worldwide I Am... World Tour, running from March 2009 through February 2010, in support of her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). The DVD on the album is a combination of performances from the tour, including guest appearances from Jay-Z and Kanye West, as well as backstage moments. Beyoncé explained that the idea of filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely. She edited the film for nine months and it serves as her directorial debut. I Am... World Tour was released in three separate editions - standard, deluxe and Blu-ray. In the United States, the standard edition was made available exclusively at Walmart on November 26, 2010. The deluxe edition was released in several countries around the world on the same date. The Blu-ray edition was released from December 3, 2010 in a list of selected countries only. Beyoncé promoted the album by appearing on several shows, including ABC's Nightline and by holding a screening of the film in New York City, in presence of several fans and artists on November 21, 2010. Prior to the release, numerous trailers were posted on Beyoncé's official website. I Am... World Tour premiered exclusively on ABC on November 25, 2010 as a ninety-minute Thanksgiving special. Upon the release of I Am... World Tour, it received mixed to positive reviews from music critics who generally praised the high-energy performances of the songs as well as Beyoncé's vocals. I Am... World Tour debuted at number one on the US Top Music Videos, giving Beyoncé her second consecutive and third non- consecutive number-one DVD in the United States. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album was also successful worldwide, peaking within the top ten on the DVD charts in every country after its release. It became the best-selling video album worldwide of 2010 and seventh of 2011. I Am... World Tour was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards (2012). == Background == To promote I Am... Sasha Fierce, Beyoncé embarked on the I Am... World Tour with several performances. The tour kicked off in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada on March 26, 2009, in support of the album. The European leg of the tour started on April 26, 2009, in Zagreb, Croatia and ended on June 9, 2009, in London, England. On June 21, 2009, she began the third leg of the tour in the United States and finished in August with a four- day stint at Encore Las Vegas on the Las Vegas Strip. Starting on September 15, 2009, the fourth leg began in Melbourne, Australia and finished on September 24 in Perth, Australia. Beyoncé then went on performing in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, and the United Kingdom, before finishing the 2009 portion of the tour on November 24 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The tour had its final leg in 2010, visiting Latin America. Starting on February 4, 2010, in Florianópolis, Brazil, she visited five other places before ending in Trinidad on February 18, 2010. According to Pollstar, the tour earned $17.2 million between January 1, and June 30, 2010, which added onto her total of $86 million for her first ninety-three concerts in 2009, bringing the tour total to $103.2 million for the ninety-seven shows. While Beyoncé was on tour, she performed at a Las Vegas residency at the Encore Theatre in Las Vegas. Titled I Am... Yours, and the August 2, 2009 show was recorded and later released as a DVD, audio CD and television special in late November 2009, titled I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas. ==Production and filming== I Am... World Tour was produced, directed and edited by Beyoncé for her own production company Parkwood Pictures. It contains tour footage from one-hundred-and-eight shows that took place in seventy-eight cities, thirty-two countries, and six continents in the presence of 1.1 million fans around the world. The show is a combination of performance clips from the tour, as well as backstage moments. I Am... World Tour also serves as the directorial debut for Beyoncé. On this occasion, she confessed that it was a lot of work for her, nevertheless, she was very happy and eager for her fans to see her film directed by herself. She explained: "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to show a little bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can only imagine how much work it was, [but] it was worth it." At the New York City screening of the film, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely "hands-on", deciding which moments made the final cut and which ones wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating: "It was hard work. I learned so much. I have a new respect for directors and I think I would like to do more of it." Some of the behind-the- scenes footage was shot by Beyoncé on her laptop. The DVD captures concert footage from cities in Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States, all edited into one concert. However, I Am... World Tour was significantly recorded at London's larger the O2 Arena, a few months after the I Am... Yours concert. A live CD of the concert, a behind-the-scenes documentary of her life along the tour and a twenty-page book of exclusive photos are all included in the package. According to a press release, "it is meant to create the ne plus ultra Knowles concert experience, seen from her perspective". ==Film synopsis== In addition to offering behind-the-scenes glimpses into Beyoncé's intimate world on tour, the film also features performances of over twenty songs with staging, choreography, lighting and production values. In between performances of "If I Were a Boy", which included a medley with Alanis Morissette's "You Oughta Know", viewers get glimpses of her childhood from old video footage. The footage transitions from Beyoncé dancing up a storm in her childhood home, to sleepless nights on tour where she worries about her health after nine consecutive days of touring, rehearsing, and recording. Despite her struggles, she sings Destiny's Child songs, "Bootylicious" and "Survivor", and asks for a guest appearance from Kanye West. For "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", Beyoncé's performance is accompanied by YouTube footage of fans mimicking her moves, and a short video clip of then-President of the United States Barack Obama. In some of the raw moments captured in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: "Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." She told Entertainment Tonight: "I wanted to do something a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it from my point of view. It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room." The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic "At Last" set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can be overwhelming, although she is blessed, stating, "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing "Halo" and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé throws up the Roc sign and exits the stage. ==Release and promotion== After Beyoncé finished her concert at the Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the next year. I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained that the idea of filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and I looked out the window and there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I guess I was a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side. Both Jay-Z and Kanye West make guest appearances on the film. In November 2010, there was a sweepstakes to win tickets to an exclusive screening of the film. A thirty- four second promo trailer of I Am... World Tour was launched on several websites in early November 2010. The album's track listing was confirmed on November 12, 2010. Several other trailers kept dropping on Beyoncé's official website during November. Beyoncé made an appearance at the School of Visual Arts Theater in Chelsea, Manhattan on November 21, 2010 to premiere the film. On November 22, 2010, she held a screening of the film in New York City, in presence of her parents and artists such as Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson, Amel Larrieux, Tyson Beckford, Alicia Keys, and AJ Calloway. Additionally, in an interview with the Associated Press on the same day, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side, stating: "I felt like I've done so many different things, it's time for me to show a bit of who I am. The hardest thing was showing that, because a lot of things that I filmed, I filmed in my computer, and I would never have gotten so open if someone else was in the room." The same day, Rolling Stone organized a competition where I Am... World Tour was one of the gifts for readers of the magazine. On November 23, 2010, Beyoncé was interviewed by Cynthia McFadden on ABC's Nightline where she stated: "I feel like I wanted the fans to be able to see the things that I see... It's a lot of things that I reveal about myself that I would never give to another director." The concert film premiered exclusively on ABC on November 25, 2010 as a ninety-minute Thanksgiving special. A year before, over Thanksgiving itself, the network aired I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas, shot at the Encore Theater, Las Vegas, on August 2, 2009. In the United States, the standard edition of the album was released exclusively at Walmart stores on November 26, 2010. The deluxe edition of I Am... World Tour includes the concert DVD, a live audio CD, an exclusive documentary, and a forty-page four-color booklet of never before seen photos of her journey around the world, and was made available on November 30, 2010 in several countries. The Blu-ray edition was released on December 7, 2010. A live instrumentals album was released digitally on February 1, 2011 and on double-sided vinyl on February 22. This is Beyoncé's third release of this nature but the first live instrumental album to have a physical release; the live instrumentals album from The Beyoncé Experience Live and I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas were her first two, only released digitally. On December 1, 2010, Entertainment Weekly offered a six-foot tall version of the poster signed by Beyoncé to one of the first ten people who posted a qualifying comment on the related post on their Facebook wall concerning the giveaway of the first ten copies of I Am... World Tour. On December 8, 2010, Perthnow collaborated with Beyoncé's official website for a competition where twenty copies of the album were available. Fans completed an entry form and signed up to receive one of the copies. ==Critical reception== Andy Kellman of AllMusic awarded I Am... World Tour three out of five stars and stated: "for anyone but the most devout fans of Beyoncé, this will be overkill, and it doesn't have as much of the playfulness such as the pleasing diversions as the I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas set." Simon Gage of Daily Express awarded it four out of five stars, complimenting Beyoncé's dance moves and praising her vocal capabilities, going on saying that she is "probably the most electric performer since Tina Turner" and calling her the "Queen of R&B;". She also praised the quality of the songs "Crazy in Love", "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" and "Halo". Ian Drew of Us Weekly complimented the "high-energy performances" of Beyoncé on the songs by Destiny's Child and enjoyed the black-and-white behind-the-scenes footage. He also added that the singer is "most revelatory when tearing up over [her] missing husband Jay-Z on the road." New Yorks Amy Odell described the DVD as a "cinematic masterpiece". Jam!s Darryl Sterdan gave the album a rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five and said: "More than two hours of powerhouse vocal performances and high-energy choreography, accompanied by endless costume changes, eye-popping production and general fabulousness. You'll get tired just watching it." Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald awarded it three out of five stars, stating that the good thing about the album is that it has a "wider range of songs", nevertheless they do not have the same "rump-rattling power" of the songs in The Beyoncé Experience simply because some songs are too short in duration, "Bootylicious" for instance. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly wrote that, although Beyoncé showed an emotional side of herself during the DVD, "Still, the shows go on in their high-heeled, wonderfully choreographed glory." Jon Pareles of The New York Times compared the DVD with Taylor Swift's Journey to Fearless which aired as a special the same day as I Am... World Tour. He noted: "Beyoncé's I Am... World Tour placed her before much larger audiences, documenting her choreographed razzle-dazzle as she played arenas and stadiums in 2009–10." He further said: "Beyoncé didn't explain: she performed. With costumes that made her a comic-book heroine, a cyborg, a club hottie, and a white-clad vision of purity, she worked her big stages with hip-pumping moves and a soul diva's voice, from creamy to raspy. The documentary quietly flaunted her consistency as a trouper in montages that segued multiple shows — supertitled in small type — with Beyoncé in the same outfit making the same moves, while the fans' nationalities changed around her. Yet for all her superhuman pep, she also came across as warmer than Ms. Swift. She grinned knowingly after belting a phrase into the bleachers, and she drew listeners into her own pop generalities. Andy Gill of The Independent was much less impressed with the DVD, qualifying it as an "unsatisfying, incoherent entertainment experience" even though she liked the way "the visual spectacle put everything in perspective". ==Accolades== The concert film received a nomination for NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Variety – Series or Special at the 42nd NAACP Image Awards (2011). I Am... World Tour was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category for Best Long Form Music Video at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards, held on February 12, 2012. ==Commercial performance== I Am... World Tour debuted at number one on the Top Music Videos in November 2010. It sold 37,000 copies in its first week and 31,000 copies in its second week of release in the United States. It spent nine non-consecutive weeks at number one in its fifteen weeks of charting. By December 26, 2010, I Am... World Tour had sold 139,000 copies in the United States. I Am... World Tour became the best- selling music DVD of 2010 and the third best-selling DVD of 2011 in the United States. The album also debuted and peaked at number forty on the US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums on the issue dated December 18, 2010. According to Nielsen SoundScan, I Am... World Tour has shipped over 200,000 copies in the United States, being certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album also topped the Brazilian Music DVD Chart. On the chart issue dated December 2, 2010, I Am... World Tour debuted and peaked at number four on the Irish Music DVD Chart. On December 11, 2010, the I Am... World Tour debuted at number six on the UK Music Videos. It descended the chart for the next three weeks, before peaking at number five on January 8, 2011.

World Tour entered the top twenty on the DVD charts in Czech Republic and Italy, peaking at numbers sixteen and eleven, respectively. In 2011, the DVD was certified gold by the Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry (ZPAV). On December 6, 2010, I Am... World Tour debuted at number six on the Australian Music DVD Chart, with more than 7,500 copies sold in the first week and hence achieved a gold certification on the same date. It was later certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for selling 15,000 copies. It was the fortieth best-selling DVD in Australia in 2010 and 2011. On the New Zealand Music DVD Chart, I Am... World Tour debuted at number five for the chart issue dated May 30, 2011, peaking at number four the following week. In 2010, I Am...

29261811	I (newspaper)	The i is a British national morning paper published in London by Daily Mail and General Trust and distributed across the United Kingdom. It is aimed at "readers and lapsed readers" of all ages and commuters with limited time, and was originally launched in 2010 as a sister paper to The Independent. It was later acquired by Johnston Press in 2016 after The Independent shifted to a digital-only model. The i came under the control of JPIMedia a day after Johnston Press filed for administration on 16 November 2018. The paper and its website were bought by the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) on 29 November 2019, for £49.6 million. On 6 December 2019 the Competition and Markets Authority served an initial enforcement order on DMGT and DMG Media Limited requiring the paper to be run separately pending investigation. The i was named British National Newspaper of the Year in 2015. Since its inception, the i has expanded its layout and coverage, adding special sections for notable events and revamping its weekend edition. The paper had an average daily circulation of 302,757 in March 2013, significantly more than The Independent, though that figure has since continued to decline, and had dropped to 233,869 by February 2019. The paper is classified as a 'quality' in the UK market but is published in the standard compact tabloid-size format. ==History== === Founding === A press statement released on the website of The Independent on 19 October 2010 announced the launch of the i. Also in October 2010, Independent Print Limited launched an advertising campaign to promote the new publication. The first issue of the i went on sale for 20p on 26 October 2010, along with a new-look version of The Independent. Starting on 7 May 2011 a Saturday edition was published, with more pages and at the price of 30p. This increased to 40p in January 2014, with the weekday edition rising to 30p. In September 2016, the price was raised to 60p, with the weekday edition rising to 50p. The i was then named National Newspaper of the Year in 2015. At the start of September 2017, the price rose once again, to 60p for the weekday edition and 80p for the relaunched i weekend beginning later that month. The paper cited the rising cost of materials needed to print the paper and the increasingly difficult environment in which print journalism finds itself. === 2016–2018 === On 11 February 2016, it was revealed that regional publisher Johnston Press, which owned The Yorkshire Post and The Scotsman, were in the advanced stages of talks to buy the i for around £24 million. The acquisition was completed before The Independent became a digital-only publication, and a "significant number" of staff joined the team from The Independent. The new editorial team was announced in April 2016 and moved one floor down in Northcliffe House. On 30 September 2017, a new, redesigned, version of the weekend edition of the i went on sale, costing 80p. This relaunch of the weekend paper saw circulation rise by around 30,000, to around 290,000 of the first edition of the redesigned paper being sold. By August 2018, the weekend edition had become the strongest day of trading for the i. In December 2017, the owners of the i, Johnston Press, announced the newspaper was bringing in a monthly profit of around £1 million. They stated that this was the result of: "Johnston Press management’s strategy of investing in improved content under editor Olly Duff's clear leadership, increased brand awareness, distribution, and advertiser solutions, while delivering efficiencies". A February 2018 trading update from parent company Johnston Press stated that the paper held a 20% market share of the 'Quality' weekday market. The i website, inews.co.uk, was reported to attract around two million unique viewers at the start of 2018, but that figure had grown 457% by November, with Comscore reporting unique visitors to the website then stood at 5.2 million, surpassing the reach of The Times and Huffington Post UK. === 2018 === In November 2018, ownership of the i alongside the other assets of Johnston Press were transferred in a pre-packaged administration deal to JPIMedia, a company set up by the bondholders of Johnston Press, after several attempts to restructure the debt or sell the business were unsuccessful. === 2019–present === On 14 September 2019, The iweekend price rose from £1 to £1.20. On 29 November 2019, it was announced that JPIMedia had sold the i newspaper and website to the Daily Mail and General Trust, which owns the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline. Lord Jonathan Harmsworth of Rothermere, the chair of DMGT, said that the paper would maintain its politically independent editorial style. In March 2021, the i broke the story that Pontins holiday parks used a list of common Irish surnames as an internal document to prevent bookings by "undesirable guests". In December 2021, DMGT announced that both i and the DMGT-owned New Scientist magazine would be moved to a new division of the company, to be called Harmsworth Media. == Format == The i is tabloid-size and stapled, and the first issue contained 56 pages. The Friday edition of the paper, which contains the "Friday" section, has a slightly increased page count, at around 65. The weekend version of the paper is significantly larger than the weekday version, containing 87 pages. The i prides itself on having no supplements, something common in many other quality British newspapers, saying they want to give readers the best experience without supplements that "clog up" recycling bins. The newspaper contains "matrices" for news, business and sports—small paragraphs of information which are expanded upon in full articles further on in the paper. The title also includes a features section titled iQ, Arts and Business sections and a television guide. The managing director of The Independent stated several days before the newspaper went into print that the publication is designed for people who do not have much time to read a newspaper. On 20 April 2011, editor Simon Kelner announced that a Saturday edition of the i would be published, starting from 7 May 2011 and costing 30 pence, 10 pence more than the weekday version. The paper is now 65p on weekdays and £1.20 at the weekend, running Monday to Saturday (although the Saturday edition is also sold on Sunday). The paper now runs a subscription, whereby customers can buy pre-paid vouchers to exchange for their copy of the paper. The subscription can be either six months or a year long and can be chosen Monday to Friday or including Saturday. There is also a discounted student subscription that lasts for one academic year. ==Political stance== Nick Clegg, former UK Deputy Prime Minister and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, a centrist party, is a fortnightly columnist for the i. His column usually features in the "My View" comment section of the paper. During an interview for the i in December 2017, then Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn declared himself to be a dedicated reader of the i, saying that its compact size and concise articles suited his busy lifestyle as Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition. During the referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union, held in June 2016, the paper chose not to declare for either "leave" or "remain", unlike a majority of other British newspapers who came out for either side of the debate. In the 2017 and 2019 UK general elections, the i chose not to endorse a political party. == Reputation == Since being named National Newspaper of the Year at the 2015 News Awards, the i has also gone on to win and be shortlisted for numerous awards in the UK. At the 2017 Press Awards, the i secured six nominations. Katy Balls was a finalist alongside Stephen Bush for Political Commentary of the Year, Yasmin Alibhai- Brown for Broadsheet Columnist of the Year, Alice Jones for Critic of the Year, Steve Connor for Science Editor of the Year, Kim Sengupta for Foreign Reporter of the Year, Sam Cunningham for Sports Journalist of the Year, while the paper itself was nominated for Best News Site of the Year. At the 2017 British Sports Journalism Awards, Hugo Lowell was nominated for Young Sports Writer of the Year. At the 2018 British Media Awards, the i won Gold in the Launch of the Year category for i weekend and Editorial Campaign of the Year category for its coverage of NHS cuts. The paper were also runner-ups for Print Product of the Year and Media Brand of the Year. The i was found in a 2018 poll to be the second-most trusted news brand in the UK after The Guardian. In March 2019, the i overtook The Guardian to become the most trusted digital newsbrand on-line, and third in print. The two then tied as most trusted national newsbrand for their paper editions in 2020; the i was third on-line. At the 2019 British Media Awards, the i won Gold in the Media Brand of the Year category, Silver for the Digital Product of the Year, and Bronze in the Print Product of the Year category. ==Editors and contributors== :See also :Category:i (newspaper) journalists ===Editors=== *Simon Kelner (2010) *Stefano Hatfield (2011) *Oliver Duff (2013) ===Regular contributors=== * Yasmin Alibhai-Brown * Katy Balls * Ian Birrell * Stephen Bush * Simon Calder * Patrick Cockburn * Ian Dunt * Stefano Hatfield * Ayesha Hazarika * Tom Kerridge * Shappi Khorsandi * Lucy Mangan * Stuart J.

It was directed by Primo Zeglio. The legends are in part based on the historical Shammuramat, queen consort of Shamshi-Adad V and regent for her son Adad-nirari III.Semiramis by Joshua J. Mark from Ancient History Encyclopedia ==Plot== During the reign of Semiramis, the beautiful queen of the Assyrian people, Assyria reaches one of the periods of greatest splendour, and to crown her successes she gives the order to build the great city of Babylon. A young woman of the court of great political ambition, Semiramis falls in love with Kir, a prince enslaved who reciprocates. Kir, king of the Dardanians, is defeated in combat by General Onnos during a military campaign launched by the latter against Nineveh in Assyria. Reduced to slavery, Kir is taken with other slaves to the capital where the general presents his prizes to King Minurte. Semiramis persuades Minurte to offer him Kir and also obtains a domain. She employs her slaves, including Kir, to build a city that becomes Babylon. Meanwhile, she leads political machinations and alliances with Kir and Onnos in order to overthrow Minurte and take her place on the throne. The conspirators manage to take Kir from the queen and convince him that he has been betrayed by Semiramis with another man. Furious, Kir takes charge of the conspiracy against his beloved. Discovering the truth, Semiramis poisons Kir by making him drink from a poisoned cup. Later, during the funeral, the queen is shot by an arrow thrown by the conspirators. The bodies of the two lovers are then burned together, united in death.Io Semiramide (I Am Semiramis) by FilmAffinity.com ==Cast== *Yvonne Furneaux as "Semiramis" *John Ericson as "Kir" *Renzo Ricci as "Minurte" *Germano Longo as "Onnos" *Gianni Rizzo as "Ghelas" *John Bartha as "Althar" *Nino di Napoli as "Adath" ==See also== * List of historical drama films and series set in Near Eastern and Western civilization * War Gods of Babylon (1962) * Queen of Babylon (1954) * The Beast of Babylon Against the Son of Hercules (1963) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1960s historical films Category:1960s historical drama films Category:1963 films Category:1963 drama films Category:1960s adventure drama films Category:1960s action adventure films Category:Sword and sandal films Category:Historical epic films Category:Romantic epic films Category:Italian historical romance films Category:1960s historical romance films Category:Italian romantic drama films Category:Italian historical adventure films Category:Italian action adventure films Category:1960s Italian-language films Category:English-language Italian films Category:Films set in ancient Mesopotamia Category:Films about royalty Category:Films based on mythology Category:Films set in the 7th century BC Category:Films set in Babylon Category:Peplum films Category:Films directed by Primo Zeglio Category:Films scored by Carlo Savina Category:Films about conspiracy theories Category:Neo-Assyrian Empire Category:Assyrian culture Category:1960s Italian films Category:Semiramis

29806322	I Can't Love You Back	"I Can't Love You Back" is a song written by Carson Chamberlain, Jeff Hyde, and Clint Daniels and recorded by American country music artist Easton Corbin. It was released in November 2010 as the third and final single from Corbin's self-titled debut album. The song peaked at number 14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. ==Content== The narrator goes through all the ways he wants to love his significant other except for the fact that she is not returning to him. ==Music video== The music video for the song was directed by Shaun Silva and premiered on Vevo and GAC in December 2010. The storyline of the video is told backwards, starting with a young woman being T-boned by a truck, presumably fatally, showing in reverse her drive into the city, walk up the driveway, through the house, and all the way back to the bedroom where Corbin does his performance. She leans down to kiss him and as she does so, time once again flows normally. The woman leaves, but not before looking back at Corbin a final time as he simply watches her intently. The video ends with her walking out the door, en route to her fate, while Corbin sits with tear- filled eyes. ==Critical reception== Kyle Ward of Roughstock gave the song a favorable review with 4.5/5 stars, saying that Corbin "pours out his heart and bears his emotions and grabs you with a convincingly heartbreaking performance." Ward also states that the production was "appropriate; wistful during the verses and a louder, more emotional score during the chorus." Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song a B grade, saying that the song is beautiful but the only flaw is his "over-singing in the choruses." ==Chart performance== "I Can't Love You Back" debuted at number 54 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the chart week ending November 27, 2010. It also debuted at number 97 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week of March 26, 2011. It peaked at number 14 in May 2011, becoming his first single to miss the Top 10 of the country chart.

3012053	I Am the Avalanche	I Am the Avalanche is an American punk rock band from Brooklyn, New York. The group's name comes from a lyric written by Vinnie Caruana for a song which was later discarded. The phrase also appears in the poem "Oh, Immobility, Death's Vast Associate" by Stephen Dobyns; however, Caruana maintains that this is a coincidence, and that he was not aware of the poem until after naming the band. ==History== I Am the Avalanche was formed by vocalist Vinnie Caruana after the break-up of his previous band The Movielife, and followed his short stint playing in Head Automatica.[ Biography], Allmusic.comBrendan Manley, Alive and Kicking. Long Island Press, September 29, 2005. Cached copy from Yahoo.com. Accessed July 3, 2007. The band also comprises drummer Brett "The Ratt" Romnes (who also produces the albums), and guitarist Brandon Swanson (former fill-in for Further Seems Forever), guitarist Michael Ireland and Kellen Robson, the former bassist of Long Island band Scraps and Heart Attacks are also members. Aside from handling vocal duties, Caruana sometimes plays guitar on certain songs such as "This Is Dungeon Music," giving the band a three-guitar attack. He has also been seen playing guitar on "My Second Restraining Order." These are in line with the band's heavier, slower sound compared to the members' previous efforts. The band toured the United Kingdom before they played America, playing 2 shows over the Halloween weekend in October 2004. Soon after this, on September 27, 2005, they released their self-titled debut album, produced by drummer Barrett Jones on Drive-Thru Records. The album received significant press coverage and mostly good reviews.Kim Owens, Review. Kaffeine Buzz. Accessed July 3, 2007.Stewart Mason, [ Review]. Allmusic.com.

The band played shows all over Australia in February 2009 as part of the annual Soundwave Festival. During their set on the Sydney leg, they played three demo tracks - "Winter Summer", "Brooklyn Dodgers" and "You've Got Spiders" (the latter two of which appeared on their second album Avalanche United) - and Vinnie Caruana also gave word of new album being released in the near future. In 2009, Set Your Goals released the title track off their second studio album titled This Will Be the Death of Us through Myspace, which featured Vinnie on vocals, furthering recent rumors that they were going to be doing a side-project together. On March 6, 2011, I Am The Avalanche opened for Paramore during a concert in Puerto Rico, where they played several songs from their upcoming album. Avalanche United was then released on October 11, 2011, to incredibly positive reviews. In a review of the album, rock music magazine 'The 1st Five' acknowledged the long wait between the band's first and second records, and also the growth it had afforded them; "Yes, six years was a long time to wait for a new I Am The Avalanche record. But if they can make another leap like the one between their self-titled debut and Avalanche United I’ll wait as long as they like."John- Michael Bond, Review. The 1st Five Accessed Oct 14, 2011.

In September 2013, it was announced that I Am The Avalanche had entered The Barber Shop Studios to begin tracking their third full length, and on January 8, 2014, the band announced via their Facebook page that their third full-length album, titled Wolverines, would be released on March 17 of that year on I Surrender Records. They wrote, 'WOLVERINES is an album that’s been a serious labor of love for us and one that we’re incredibly proud of.

30162288	I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore	"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore" is a song written by Pam Sawyer and Laurie Burton in 1965. Originally envisioned to be recorded by a British Invasion artist, the song was extremely well liked by American rock group the Young Rascals, and they subsequently recorded the song and released it as their debut single in November 1965 through Atlantic Records. Though only a marginal hit, reaching number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100, it largely established the band on the American music scene. It has since been included on several albums by the band, including their eponymous debut album, and several compilation albums, including Time Peace: The Rascals' Greatest Hits, on which it was the opening track. The song is heavily characterized by lead vocalist Eddie Brigati's spoken word during the verses, and is one of the only songs by the band to feature their initial lineup with Brigati on lead vocals; subsequent releases primarily feature Felix Cavaliere on lead vocals. Upon release it received primarily positive reviews in the American press and charted internationally as well. Retrospectively, the song has also been praised, with many critics noting it to have fallen into obscurity thanks to its relatively low charting compared to their later singles. "I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore" has since been covered by several notable bands, including The Jackson 5 and the Primitives. Australian band Divinyls and American group Angel both had commercial success with their versions. == Background == Both Pam Sawyer and Laurie Burton were respected songwriters, with Sawyer having written several songs for Motown artists,Steve Armitage, "Pam Sawyer: One of Motown's most distinctive lyricists" , Blues & Soul, #102, 1973, pp.22-23Songs written by Pam Sawyer, MusicVF.com. Retrieved 17 April 2016 and Burton having written her own songs.Lori Burton Discography, Soulful Kinda Music. Retrieved 19 April 2016 Together, they had also recorded and written music as the Whyte Boots,Doug Sheppard, "Lori Burton: Breakout", PopMatters.com, 26 January 2006. Retrieved 19 April 2016 and had started branching out to other artists as well. According to Burton, "I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore" was originally intended to be recorded by a British Invasion artist. They changed their mind upon hearing the Young Rascals perform. There, they showcased the song for the group, with Burton playing piano, much to the Young Rascals' liking. The song was one of two Sawyer–Burton compositions recorded by the group, the other being "Baby, Let's Wait" which appears on their debut album. Formed in early 1965, the Young Rascals quickly became known throughout the music scene in and around New York City. This led the group to quickly garner fans, and as their set-list mostly contained rhythm and blues and soul covers, they eventually received a $15,000 contract with Atlantic Records. As Atlantic's roster at the time only consisted of African American performers, the Young Rascals became the first white band on the label. The first version of "I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore" was recorded during their second session, held on September 20, 1965, at A & R Recording in New York City. A second version of the song was recorded on November 2, together with what would become the B-side, Larry Williams' "Slow Down. This version remains unreleased. == Release == Atlantic released "I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore" on November 22, 1965, backed by "Slow Down" as Atlantic 45–2312. Critic Richie Unterberger calls the song an "impressive start". The song stands unique in the fact that it was one of the Young Rascals first and among their only singles using their original line-up Eddie Brigati on lead vocals and percussion, Felix Cavaliere on keyboards and backing vocals, Gene Cornish on guitar and backing vocals, and Dino Danelli on drums; Cavaliere would pick up singing duties on the following single "Good Lovin'", and would assume this role for most of band's future recording career. Cornish stated that the single initially was off to a slow-start, initially charting only locally on the East Coast. Upon the group's first tour to Los Angeles four weeks after the single was released, the band broke attendance record at the Whisky a Go Go and subsequently received airplay on the West Coast as well. As Cornish puts it, "it never had concentrated airplay throughout the entire country all at one time" as it had dropped off most charts on the east coast by then. Besides local charts, "I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore" also sold enough copies to chart on a national level. The single initially entered the Billboard Hot 100 on December 25 at a position of number 94. It then spent several weeks slowly creeping up the chart, before finally reaching its peak at number 52 on February 5, 1966. It dropped out of the charts on February 19, at a position of number 72. It fared slightly worse on the Cashbox Top 100, entering the chart on December 11, 1965, at a position of 100. It peaked more than a month later, on January 29, when it reached number 63. It dropped out of the chart that same day. Internationally, the single was also noted in Australia, where it breached the top-50, reaching number 48. The single was most successful in Canada, where it reached number 23 on the RPM charts. Both sides of the single experienced their first album release on The Young Rascals, the group's debut album, which was released on March 28, 1966. As this album was issued in both stereo and mono, this meant that its initial release in stereo came on the album. Most singles at the time were only released in mono. The song has also been released on various compilation albums by the group, most notably Time Peace: The Rascals' Greatest Hits, which reached number one on the Billboard 200. On the album it was used as the opening track. == Reception and legacy == It received primarily positive reviews in the American press upon initial release. In a review for Billboard, the anonymous critic writes that this "debut of new foursome proves a hot entry for chart action." They positively note the slow arrangement, considering it "right up the teen market." They also predicted it to reach the top-60. In Cashbox, the critic starts by writing that the Young Rascals were one of the most "discussed new groups" from New York City, which led to this "auspicious initial deck". They note that "I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore" should create "even more excitement for the crew". They write that the song is an apparent ode about a "love-sick guy" who eventually gets over it, which the critic largely attributes to the song's "hard- driving", "pulsating and dancable riff". In Record World, the single was chosen as a "sleeper of the week." According to the critic, the single affirms the Young Rascals reputation "as a crowd to watch", along with continuing their reputation as "being something else." Retrospectively, the song has also been singled out for praise. Unterberger writes that "I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore" was, together with "Good Lovin'" and "Baby, Let's Wait" one of the highlights on The Young Rascals. In a review for AllMusic, critic Matthew Greenwald states that this "angst-ridden teenage ballad" was the world's introduction to the Young Rascals. He claims that the song has a "Stonsey, garage band grunge to it", while simultaneously praising the inclusion of rhythm and blues. Though he writes that the song isn't one of the group's strongest, he ends by saying that it "paved the way for a promising future for the group." Charles Andrews of Santa Monica Daily Press writes that the song is "better stuff than most bands can manage in a year", while Ben Wener of Orange County Register calls it a "stomping garage rock classic." Guitarist Steven Van Zandt has stated that upon hearing the song for the first time in the 1960s, it was "sexier than the sex I was having with my girlfriend." == Charts == Chart performance for "I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore" Chart (1965–66) Peak position Australia (Kent Music Report) 48 Canada (RPM) Top Singles 23 US Billboard Hot 100 52 US Cashbox Top 100 63 US Record World 100 Top Pops 62 == Later versions == === Divinyls version === Background In late 1992, Australian rock duo Divinyls recorded the song for the soundtrack to the film Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It was also issued as the lead single from their second compilation album, The Collection. The single went to the top twenty in Australia, peaking at number nineteen, and spent sixteen weeks in the top fifty. According to writer Paul Cashmere, Mark McEntee put his mark on the song through his reworking of the song's riff, which makes the song an entirely other version than the Rascals. Writing for BuzzFeed, Summer Ante Burton lists it as her "sleeper favorite" in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, writing that it is a fantastic rework of "an amazing and underrated '60s classic", and notes that due to the comedy horror found in the movie, "I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore" was ironically fitting. Charts Chart (1992–93) Peak position Australia (Kent Music Report) 19 === Other renditions === In 1966 the UK band The Primitives covered the song in Italian. The song was called "Yeeeeeeh!" and became a hit in Italy. The Jackson 5 recorded the song in 1971 during the sessions for their album Maybe Tomorrow, but it remained unreleased until its inclusion on their 1979 album, Boogie. The song was recorded by glam rock band Angel in 1978 for their album White Hot.

She longed for home and wrote of a happier time, unspecified in the novel apart from a reference to living in the 1930s. Smith was already an established playwright and later became famous for writing the children's classic The Hundred and One Dalmatians. The novel relates the adventures of an eccentric family, the Mortmains, struggling to live in genteel poverty in a decaying castle during the 1930s. The first- person narrator is Cassandra Mortmain, an intelligent teenager who tells the story through her journal. It is a coming-of-age story in which Cassandra passes from being a girl at the beginning to being a young woman at the end. In 2003 the novel was listed at number 82 in the BBC's survey The Big Read."The Big Read". BBC. April 2003, retrieved 26 October 2012 == Plot == The novel takes place between April and October in a single year in the 1930s. The Mortmain family is genteel, poor, and eccentric. Cassandra's father is a writer suffering from writer's block who has not published anything since his first book, Jacob Wrestling (a reference to Jacob wrestling with the angel), an innovative and "difficult" modernist novel that sold well and made his name, including in the United States. Ten years before the novel begins he took out a forty-year lease on a dilapidated but beautiful castle, hoping to find either inspiration or isolation there. Now his family is selling off the furniture to buy food. The widowed Mortmain's second wife, Topaz, is a beautiful artist's model who enjoys communing with nature, sometimes wearing nothing but hip boots. Rose, Mortmain's elder daughter, is a classic English beauty pining away in the lonely castle, longing for a chance to meet eligible and preferably rich young men. She tells her sister Cassandra that she wants to live in a Jane Austen novel. Cassandra, the younger daughter and the first- person narrator of the novel, has literary ambitions and spends a lot of time developing her writing talent by "capturing" everything around her in her journal. Stephen, the handsome, loyal, live-in son of the Mortmain late maid, and Thomas, the youngest Mortmain child, round out the cast of household characters. Stephen, a "noble soul," is in love with Cassandra, which she finds touching but a bit awkward. Thomas, a schoolboy, is, like Cassandra, considered "tolerably bright". Things begin to happen when the Cottons, a wealthy American family, inherit nearby Scoatney Hall and become the Mortmains' new landlords. Cassandra and Rose soon become intrigued by the unmarried brothers Simon and Neil Cotton. Neil, who was raised in California by their English father, is a carefree young man who wants to become a rancher in the United States. Simon, who grew up in New England with his mother, is scholarly and serious, and loves the English countryside. Simon is the elder brother and therefore the heir, and is already much wealthier than Neil, so, although Rose is not attracted to him, she decides to marry him if she can, declaring that she would marry the Devil himself to escape poverty. At their first meeting the Cottons are amused and interested by the Mortmains. When they pay a call the very next day, however, the inexperienced Rose flirts openly with Simon and makes herself look ridiculous. Both brothers are repelled by this display and, as they walk away, Cassandra overhears them resolving to drop all acquaintance with the Mortmains. After an amusing episode involving a fur coat, however, all is forgiven and the two families become good friends. Rose decides that she really is taken with Simon, and Cassandra and Topaz scheme to get Simon to propose to her. Simon falls in love with Rose and proposes to her. Rose and Topaz go to London with Mrs Cotton to purchase Rose's wedding trousseau. While everyone else is away Cassandra and Simon spend the evening together, which leads to their kissing. Cassandra becomes obsessed with Simon, but suffers feelings of guilt since he is Rose's fiancé. Cassandra concludes that she must tactfully deflect Stephen's offer of love, and encourage him in his emerging career as a model and a film actor. She joins forces with Thomas to help their father overcome his writer's block by the drastic expedient of imprisoning him in a medieval tower; copes with her own increasing attraction to Simon; and records everything in her journal. Meanwhile, unnoticed by everyone but Stephen, Rose and Neil have been falling in love. To conceal their budding romance they pretend to hate each other. When they eventually elope Simon is left heartbroken, but Cassandra becomes hopeful. Before Simon leaves to go back to the United States, he comes to see Cassandra. In spite of her feelings for him, Cassandra deflects the conversation at a moment when she thinks he might be about to propose to her, in the belief that he is still in love with Rose. The book closes on an ambiguous note, with Cassandra reminding herself that Simon has promised to return and closing her journal for good by reasserting her love for him. ==References and allusions== ===Prose works=== Novels mentioned in I Capture the Castle include À la recherche du temps perdu by Proust and War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy. At one point in the book Rose and Cassandra begin, but do not finish, a bedtime conversation about whether Jane Austen or Charlotte Brontë is "better". The Vicar describes Cassandra as "Jane Eyre with a touch of Becky Sharp", the latter being the leading character in Vanity Fair. Edgar Allan Poe's short story "The Fall of the House of Usher" is also mentioned. Cassandra mentions having read What Maisie Knew, thinking it to be a children's book. Villette, also by Charlotte Brontë, is referenced when Cassandra considers "confessing" to the Vicar as a means of soothing her mind. ===Theatre=== Cassandra compares Stephen to Silvius, a character in Shakespeare's As You Like It. Simon compares Cassandra to Portia, a character in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice when he quotes the line, "Oh, wise, young judge." ===Biblical episodes=== Biblical episodes, mainly Jacob's Ladder and Jacob Wrestling, are apparently referred to in Mr Mortmain's successful novel Jacob Wrestling, though the content of that novel is never clearly represented to the reader. Cassandra calls it "a mixture of fiction, philosophy and poetry". Samson and Delilah also play a small part in I Capture the Castle, as Cassandra compares Simon and Rose to them. When he starts to try to write a new book Mr Mortmain considers the theme of Noah's Ark, but finally decides not to use a biblical theme again. ===Tales and legends=== "Héloïse" and "Abelard" are respectively the names of the family's dog and cat. Also cited are the "Sleeping Beauty" and "Hansel and Gretel". ===Verse=== Stephen plagiarises from numerous poets in an attempt to impress Cassandra, including Algernon Charles Swinburne, then tries to imitate Robert Herrick in his first attempts at original verse. John Keats, G. K. Chesterton, Thomas Nashe and Percy Bysshe Shelley are also quoted. Cassandra also mentions Chaucer and William Langland, and the round "Sumer is icumen in" when, during an impromptu luncheon in the village with Simon, Neil and Rose, school children begin singing it. ===Art=== At a dinner party guests describe each other in terms of famous artists. Topaz is called a work by William Blake, Rose is said to resemble Emma, Lady Hamilton, the muse of the painter George Romney, Simon says that Cassandra is like "Girl with a Mousetrap," a painting by Joshua Reynolds, and Mrs Fox-Cotton is said to be a work by Salvador Dalí "with snakes coming out of her ears". ===Music=== Simon introduces Cassandra to the works of Claude Debussy: "Clair de lune", "La cathédrale engloutie", "La terrasse des audiences du clair de lune". She also listens to J. S. Bach's "Sheep May Safely Graze" which she later searches for amongst the Vicar's collection of records. Simon and Cassandra dance to the song "Lover" before he kisses her. The song then takes on a special significance for her, and she hears it again when Neil and Rose are dancing together in London. ==Adaptations== *Smith adapted her novel into a two-act play "with musical notes" in 1954. *In 1963 Walt Disney Productions announced plans to film the novel with Hayley Mills in the role of Cassandra. Disney ended up dropping the project, while still retaining film rights to the book, when Smith and the selected screenwriter Sally Benson did not get along. Mills grew too old for the part before the project could be revived, but Disney denied film rights to any other studio until intense legal leveraging in the late 1990s after Smith's death, which eventually resulted in the 2003 BBC Film production. *After Disney released the film rights to the novel in the late 1990s, Heidi Thomas wrote a screen adaptation. This resulted in a 2003 feature film directed by Tim Fywell for BBC Films. It starred Romola Garai as Cassandra. *In November 2015, a BBC Radio 4 adaption was broadcast, which was dramatised by Jane Rogers and directed by Nadia Molinari. It starred Holliday Grainger as Cassandra and Toby Jones as Mortmain. *A musical adaptation with book and lyrics by Teresa Howard and music by Steven Edis received its staged premiere at the Watford Palace Theatre in April 2017. It was directed by Brigid Larmour. *A musical adaptation with lyrics by Marion Adler, score by Peter Foley, and book by Cara Reichel was commissioned by Signature Theatre's American Musical Voices Project: Next Generation (Arlington, Virginia) and given staged readings in 2013 at Pace New Musicals (Pace University, New York, New York). ==Critical reception== On 5 November 2019, the BBC News listed I Capture the Castle on its list of the 100 most influential novels. I Capture The Castle was cited by Armistead Maupin as an influence on his novel Maybe the Moon, which he also structured as a diary. ==References== ==External links== *A reading group guide for I Capture the Castle.

3030170	I Can See for Miles	"I Can See for Miles" is a song by the English rock band the Who, recorded for the band's 1967 album The Who Sell Out. Written by guitarist Pete Townshend, it was the only song from the album to be released as a single. ==Recording== Recorded in several separate sessions in studios across two continents, the recording of "I Can See for Miles" exemplifies the increasingly sophisticated studio techniques of rock bands in the late 1960s, such as those used for the Beatles and the Beach Boys. The backing tracks were recorded at CBS Studios in London, the vocals and overdubbing were performed at Talentmasters Studios in New York, and the single was mixed and mastered at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles. The initial UK mono pressing (Track Records) and the US Decca single has an overdubbed second bass line mixed upfront, whilst the drums are mixed slightly lower. ==Critical reception== The song is ranked number 40 on Dave Marsh's "The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made",The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made number 37 on NME's "The Top 100 Singles of All-Time", and number 162 on Pitchfork's "The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s." Billboard described the single as a "compelling off-beat number full of excitement and drive," stating that a "strong dance beat supports smooth vocal blend with top production work." Cash Box said that it's a "solid, thumping, hard-driving, discotheque- styled rock stand" that's "a real powerhouse." In a review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger called "I Can See for Miles" "one of the greatest Who songs", adding that it also features "one of Keith Moon's greatest performances" and "one of the best drum parts ever on a rock record". It was ranked number 262 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list in 2010. In 2012, Paste ranked the song number four on their list of the 20 greatest The Who songs, and in 2022, Rolling Stone ranked the song number two on their list of the 50 greatest The Who songs. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 350th most celebrated song in popular music history. ==Charts and legacy== "I Can See for Miles" reached number 10 in the UK Singles Chart. In the US, it peaked at number 9, the group's highest showing on the Billboard Hot 100 and in Canada, it reached number four. Though Townshend had high hopes for the single, it ended up charting lower than most of the group's records up to that time. He wrote the song in 1966, but had held it back as an "ace in the hole", believing it would be the Who's first number-one single: "To me it was the ultimate Who record, yet it didn't sell. I spat on the British record buyer", Townshend later commented. The song may have inspired the Beatles' "Helter Skelter". Paul McCartney recalls writing "Helter Skelter" after reading a review of The Who Sell Out in which the critic claimed that "I Can See for Miles" was the "heaviest" song he had ever heard. McCartney had not heard the song but wrote "Helter Skelter" in an attempt to make an even "heavier" song than the one praised in the review, "to be the most raucous vocal, the loudest drums, et cetera". ==References== Category:The Who songs Category:1967 singles Category:British psychedelic rock songs Category:Songs written by Pete Townshend Category:Track Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Kit Lambert Category:1967 songs Category:CSI: Cyber Category:Television drama theme songs
304443	I Am Mary Dunne	I Am Mary Dunne is a novel, first published in 1968, by Northern Irish- Canadian writer Brian Moore about one day in the life of a beautiful and well- to-do 31-year-old Canadian woman living in New York City with her third husband, a successful playwright. Triggered by seemingly unimportant occurrences, the protagonist / first person narrator remembers her past in a series of flashbacks, which reveal her insecurities, her bad conscience concerning her first two husbands, and her fear that she is on the brink of insanity. I Am Mary Dunne has been described as "perhaps [Brian Moore's] best book". Robert Fulford, writing in Canada's The Globe and Mail, calls it "[a] feminist novel written before the wave of feminist novels began". In its original draft, I Am Mary Dunne was called A Woman of No Identity. ==References== ==Further reading== * Brady, Charles A.

3065626	I Capuleti e i Montecchi	I Capuleti e i Montecchi (The Capulets and the Montagues) is an Italian opera (tragedia lirica) in two acts by Vincenzo Bellini. The libretto by Felice Romani was a reworking of the story of Romeo and Juliet for an opera by Nicola Vaccai called Giulietta e Romeo and based on the play of the same name by Luigi Scevola written in 1818, thus an Italian source rather than taken directly from William Shakespeare. Bellini was persuaded to write the opera for the 1830 Carnival season at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice, with only a month and a half available for composition. He succeeded by appropriating a large amount of music previously written for his unsuccessful opera Zaira. The first performance of I Capuleti e i Montecchi took place on 11 March 1830.Performance history from OperatodaySynopsis from operajaponica ==Composition history== thumb|left|upright|Bellini in about 1830 thumb|upright|Mezzo-soprano Giuditta Grisi sang Romeo After Zaira Following the poor reception which Zaira received in Parma, Bellini returned to Milan by the end of June 1829 with no contract for another opera in sight. Giovanni Pacini, another Catanese composer, was still in Milan after the well-received premiere of his Il Talismano, and he received offers to compose an opera for both Turin and Venice for the following Carnival season. He accepted both offers, but the La Fenice impresario, Alessandro Lanari, included a proviso that if he were to be unable to fulfill the Venice contract, then it would be transferred to Bellini. A firm offer of a contract for a new opera for Venice appeared in the autumn, a contract which also included a provision that Il pirata would also be given during the 1830 Carnival season. By mid-December Bellini was in Venice where he heard the same singers who were to perform in Pirata: they were Giuditta Grisi, the tenor Lorenzo Bonfigli, and Giulio Pellegrini. Bellini in Venice thumb|left|upright|Venice impresario Alessandro Lanari thumb|upright|Soprano Rosalbina Caradori-Allan sang Giulietta thumb|upright|left|Composer Giovanni Pacini thumb|upright|Maria Malibran as Romeo, Bologna, 1832 With rehearsals for Pirata underway in late December, Bellini was given notice by Lanari that it was doubtful whether Pacini would be present in time to stage an opera and that a contract was to be prepared for Bellini to provide a new opera but with the proviso that it would only become effective on 14 January. Accepting the offer on 5 January, Bellini stated that he would set Romani's libretto for Giulietta Capellio, that he required 45 days between receipt of the libretto and the first performance, and that he would accept 325 napoleoni d'oro (about 8,000 lire).Bellini to Lanari, 5 January 1830, in : Weinstock notes that Romani had used "Capellio" as Juliet's last name in the libretto. The tentative contract deadline was extended until 20 January, but by that date Romani was in Venice, having already re-worked much of his earlier libretto which he had written for Nicola Vaccai's 1825 opera, Giulietta e Romeo, the source for which was the play of the same name by Luigi Scevola in 1818. The two men set to work, but with the winter weather in Venice becoming increasingly bad, Bellini fell ill; however, he had to continue to work under great pressure within a now-limited timetable. Eventually, revisions to Romani's libretto were agreed to, a new title was given to the work, and Bellini reviewed his score of Zaira to see how some of the music could be set to the new text, but composing the part of Romeo for Grisi. He also took Giulietta's "Oh quante volte" and Nelly's romanza from Adelson e Salvini. The Giulietta was to be sung by Rosalbina Caradori-Allan. ==Performance history== thumb|upright|Giuditta Pasta, Romeo in 1833 thumb|upright|Wilhelmine Schröder- Devrient, Romeo in 1834 and 1835 thumb|upright|Giuseppina Ronzi de Begnis, restored Bellini's ending, 1834 ===19th century=== At the premiere of I Capuleti e i Montecchi on 11 March 1830 success for Bellini returned. Weinstock describes the premiere as "an unclouded and immediate success" but it was only able to be performed eight times before the La Fenice season closed on 21 March. A local newspaper, I Teatri, reported that "all things considered, this opera by Bellini has aroused as much enthusiasm in Venice as La straniera aroused in Milan from the first evening on".Cambi (ed.), in By this time, Bellini knew that he had achieved fame: writing on 28 March, he stated that: "My style is now heard in the most important theatres in the world...and with the greatest enthusiasm."Bellini, quoted by Lippmann and McGuire 1998, in Sadie, p. 390 Before leaving Venice, Bellini was offered a contract to produce another new opera for La Fenice for the 1830–31 Carnival season, and—upon his return to Milan—he also found an offer from Genoa for a new opera but proposed for the same time period, an offer he was forced to reject. Later that year, Bellini prepared a version of Capuleti for La Scala which was given on 26 December, lowering Giulietta's part for the mezzo- soprano Amalia Schütz Oldosi. Very quickly after the premiere, performances began to be given all over Italy in about thirty different productions up to 1835. It continued to be seen fairly regularly until the end of the 1860s.Performances listed on librettodopera.it Details of European productions, which were numerous and which began in Dresden on 1 October 1831, continued into the 1840s. The opera was first staged in the UK on 20 July 1833 and in the US on 4 April 1837 at the St Charles Theatre in New Orleans; later, first US performances were given in Boston on 13 May 1847 and in New York on 28 January 1848."Performance data" in In 1859 a French version, translated by Charles Nuitter, premiered in Paris Opera. It was prepared specially for the singer Felicita von Vestvali, who sang Romeo. The audience celebrated her performances enthusiastically and the critics compared Vestvali to Maria Malibran, Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient and Rachel Félix. Napoleon III was so captivated with her that he presented her with a solid silver suit of armor for her performance. ===20th century=== The opera was unheard in the 20th century until a concert performance was recorded for an RAI radio broadcast in 1957 with Antonietta Pastori as Giulietta, Fiorenza Cossotto as Romeo, and Lorin Maazel leading the music forces. The first United States performance during the 20th century was presented by the American Opera Society (AOS) in a concert version at Carnegie Hall in 1958 with Giulietta Simionato as Romeo, Laurel Hurley as Giulietta, Richard Cassilly as Tebaldo, Ezio Flagello as Cappellio, and conductor Arnold Gamson. It was the first time the opera had been performed in New York City in one hundred years, and was recorded on disc. The AOS presented the opera in concert again at Carnegie Hall in 1964 with Mary Costa as Giulietta and Simionato reprising the role of Romeo; a performance which was also recorded. La Scala staged the opera in 1967 using new designs by Emanuele Luzzati and musical forces led by Claudio Abbado. This staging reworked the part of Romeo for the tenor voice, with Giacomo Aragall taking on the role. Aragall had sung this reworked version earlier under Abbado's baton at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna and the Holland Festival in 1966 with Margherita Rinaldi as Giulietta. The La Scala production toured to Expo 67 in Montreal, and its cast included Renata Scotto as Giulietta, Luciano Pavarotti as Tybalt, Agostino Ferrin as Capulet, and Alfredo Giacomotti as Lawrence. Aragall and Scotto reprised their roles in this version of the opera with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company at the Academy of Music in 1968. Tenor Renzo Casellato portrayed Romeo at the Teatro Colón in 1971, and tenor Veriano Luchetti sang Romeo in La Fenice's 1973 staging. In 1975 conductor Sarah Caldwell and the Opera Company of Boston mounted the opera with Tatiana Troyanos as Romeo and Beverly Sills as Giulietta. Sills also performed that role the same year in a London concert with the Philharmonia Orchestra with Janet Baker as Romeo. Troyanos reprised the part of Romeo in 1985 for the Lyric Opera of Chicago's first staging of the opera with Cecilia Gasdia as Giulietta. In 1977 the Dallas Opera staged the work with Marilyn Horne as Romeo and Linda Zoghby as Giulietta. That same year the Vienna State Opera presented the work for the first time with Sona Ghazarian as Giulietta and Agnes Baltsa as Romeo. Baltsa portrayed Romeo again in multiple productions; including the opera's first staging at The Royal Opera of London (1984, with Edita Gruberová as Giulietta) and the Liceu (1985, with Alida Ferrarini as Giulietta), and in the 1987 La Scala production with June Anderson as Giulietta. The opera had stagings at several opera houses in the 1990s, including La Fenice (1991), Teatro di San Carlo (1995), the Semperoper (1998), and the Scottish Opera (1998). In 1999 conductor Eve Queler and the Opera Orchestra of New York presented the opera in concert at Avery Fisher Hall with Vesselina Kasarova as Romeo and Annick Massis as Giulietta. ===21st century=== Modern day productions have been mounted fairly frequently, with 102 performances of 27 productions given in 24 cities since 1 January 2011 and forward into 2015.Performances since 1 January 2011 listed on operabase.com Retrieved 10 August 2013 A San Francisco Opera production opened on 29 September 2012 featuring Nicole Cabell and Joyce DiDonato as the lovers, and both singers were part of a Lyric Opera of Kansas City production in September 2013.Paul Horsley, "Family Ties: Eternal ‘clash of clans’ shines in Lyric’s polished, beautifully sung production", The Independent (Kansas City), 23 September 2013 on www.kcindependent.com On 28 September 2014, Washington Concert Opera presented a concert performance of the work with Kate Lindsey as Romeo, Nicole Cabell as Giulietta, and David Portillo as Tebaldo.

Capellio is the father of Giulietta (Juliet) and the leader of the Capuleti. Giulietta is betrothed to Tebaldo (Tybalt), however she has already met and fallen in love with Romeo, leader of the Montecchi (Montagues). This is a secret to all but Lorenzo (Lawrence), her doctor and confidant. Complicating matters, Romeo has inadvertently killed the son of Capellio (Giulietta's brother) in battle.The synopsis by Simon Holledge was first published on Opera japonica and appears here by permission. :Place: around the palace of Capellio (Capulet) in Verona :Time: 13th century Sinfonia ===Act 1=== Scene 1: The Palace Capellio and Tebaldo address their followers advising rejection of an offer of peace to be brought by an envoy from Romeo, the man who had killed Capellio's son. Tebaldo states that he will avenge the killing to celebrate his marriage to Giulietta: (Cavatina: È serbata a questo acciaro / "And reserved for this sword / is the vengeance of your blood") and he urges Capellio to hasten the moment when he may marry Giulietta and then avenge Capellio. The doctor, Lorenzo, objects that Giulietta is ill with a fever, but Capellio brushes his warning aside and declares the wedding will take place immediately. Tebaldo proclaims his love for Giulietta: Sì: M'Abbraccia / "I love her so much / She is so dear to me". Capellio's men urge him on and arrangements are made to have the wedding take place that day. While the men proclaim their hatred of the Montecchi, Romeo enters in the guise of a Montecchi envoy, offering peace to be guaranteed by the marriage of Romeo and Giulietta. He explains that Romeo regrets the death of Capellio's son (Cavatina: Ascolta: Se Romeo t'uccise un figlio / "Listen: If Romeo killed your son / he brought him death in battle / And you must blame fate"), and offers to take his place as a second son for the old man. Capellio indicates that Tebaldo has already taken on that role and—together with all his men—rejects all idea of peace: "War! War", the men proclaim. Romeo accepts their challenge of war: (Cabaletta: La tremenda ultrice spada/ "Romeo will prepare to brandish the dread avenging sword / Romeo accepts your challenge of war.) Scene 2: Giulietta's room Giulietta enters proclaiming her frustration against all the wedding preparations which she sees about her. Recitative: "I burn, a fire consumes me wholly. In vain do I seek solace from the winds... Where are you Romeo?". Cavatina: Oh! quante volte / "Oh how many times do I weep and beg heaven for you". Lorenzo enters, explaining that he has arranged for Romeo to come to her by a secret door. When Romeo enters, he tries to persuade Giulietta to escape with him. Duetto: Romeo: Sì, fuggire: a noi non resta / "Yes, flee, for us there is no other escape"; he demands: "What power is greater for you than love?", but she resists in the name of duty, law, and honour, declaring that she would prefer to die of a broken heart. Romeo is distraught: Cantabile: Romeo: Ah crudel, d'onor ragioni / "Oh cruel one, you speak of honour when you were stolen from me?" Giulietta responds "Ah what more you ask of me?", then, in a tempo di mezzo in which each expresses his/her conflicting emotions, the situation becomes more and more impossible for them both. The sounds of wedding preparations are heard: Giulietta urges Romeo to flee; he declares that he will stay and, in a final cabaletta in which Romeo pleads "Come, ah Come! Rely on me", Giulietta continues to resist. Each leaves. Scene 3: Another part of the palace The Capuleti are celebrating the forthcoming marriage. All those assembled join in. Romeo enters in disguise and tells Lorenzo, who immediately recognises him, that he is awaiting the support of his soldiers, one thousand of whom are assembled dressed as Ghibelines and who are intent on preventing the wedding. Lorenzo remonstrates with him, but suddenly, the armed attack by the Montecchi takes place as they surge into the palace, Romeo with them. Giulietta is alone, lamenting the state of affairs, Tace il fragor / "The tumult has ended". Then she sees Romeo, who has appeared, and again he urges her to run away with him: "I ask this in the name of promised love", he declares. Capellio, Tebaldo and the Ghibelines discover them, and believe that Romeo is still the Montecchi envoy. As Giulietta tries to shield him from her father, Romeo proudly tells them his true name. The Montecchi enter to protect him and, in a concerted finale involving all from both factions, the lovers are separated by their family members, finally proclaiming: Al furor che si ridesta / "If all hope of ever seeing each other again in life / this will not be the last farewell". Capellio, Tebaldo, and Lorenzo become part of the quintet finale, as the ranks of the supporters of both sides join in the swell. ===Act 2=== 220px|thumb|Francesco Hayez, Romeo and Juliet's last kiss Scene 1: Another part of the Palace Introduced by a solo for cello, Giulietta awaits news of the fighting. Lorenzo enters and immediately tells her that Romeo lives, but she will soon be taken away to Tebaldo's castle. He offers a solution: that she must take a sleeping potion which will make it appear that she has died. She will then be taken to her family's tomb where he will arrange for Romeo and himself to be present when she awakes. In a state of indecision, she contemplates her options. (Aria: Morte io non temo, il sai / "You know that I do not fear death, / I have always asked death of you...") and she expresses doubts while Lorenzo urges her to take the potion, given that her father is about to come into the room. Taking the bottle, she declares that "only death can wrest me from my cruel father". With his followers, Capellio comes to order her to leave with Tebaldo at dawn. Her ladies beg her father to be kinder towards her. Proclaiming that she is close to death, she begs her father's forgiveness: Cabaletta: Ah! non poss'io partire / "Ah, I cannot leave without your forgiveness.....Let your anger turn just once to peace", but Capellio rejects her and orders her to her room. He then instructs his men to keep watch on Lorenzo of whom he is suspicious; they are ordered not to allow Lorenzo to have contact with anyone. Scene 2: The grounds of the palace An orchestral introduction precedes Romeo's entrance and introduces what Weinstock describes as "his bitter recitative", Deserto è il loco / "This place is abandoned", in which he laments Lorenzo's apparent forgetfulness in failing to meet him as planned. He then hears the noise of someone entering. It is Tebaldo, and the two men begin an angry duet (Tebaldo: Stolto! a un sol mio grido / "With one cry a thousand men will arrive". Romeo: "I scorn you. You will wish the alps and the sea stood between us"). As they are about to begin fighting, the sound of a funeral procession is heard (Pace alla tua bell'anima). They stop and listen, only then realising that it is a procession for Giulietta. In a cabaletta finale, the rivals are united in remorse, asking each other for death as they continue to fight. Scene 3: The tombs of the Capuleti Along with his Montecchi followers, Romeo enters the tomb of the Capuleti. The followers mourn Giulietta's death. At her tomb and in order to bid her farewell, Romeo asks for it to be opened. He also asks that the Montecchi leave him alone with Giulietta: Romanza: Deh! tu, bell'anima / "Alas! You, fair soul / Rising up to heaven / turn to me, bear me with you". Realising his only course of action will be death, he swallows poison and, lying down beside her, he hears a sigh, then the sound of her voice. Giulietta wakes up to find that Romeo knew nothing of her simulated death and had been unaware of Lorenzo's plan. Urging him to leave with her, Giulietta gets up but Romeo states that he must remain there forever, explaining that he has already acted to end his life. In a final cabaletta, the couple clings to each other. Then he dies and Giulietta, unable to live on without him, falls dead onto his body. The Capuleti and Montecchi rush in to discover the dead lovers, with Capellio demanding who is responsible: "You, ruthless man", they all proclaim. ==Music== Musical borrowings Musicologist Mary Ann Smart has examined the issue of Bellini's "borrowings" and she notes: "Bellini's famously scrupulous attitude to the matching of music and poetry did not prevent him from borrowing from himself almost as frequently as did the notoriously economical Handel and Rossini." Specifically, in regard to I Capuleti, she continues: > Bellini lost no time in rescuing much of [Zairas] material, reusing no fewer > than eight numbers in his next opera. The music that had failed so > completely in Parma was acclaimed in Venice in its new guise, probably more > because the Venice audience was inherently better disposed to Bellini's > style than because of any aesthetic improvement. But if we can take Bellini > at his word, the extensive self-borrowing involved in recasting Zaira as I > Capuleti was no lazy response to a looming deadline: although he was indeed > forced to compose faster than he liked, he remarked repeatedly on how hard > he was working, on one occasion complaining that the act 1 finale of > Capuleti—one of the numbers copied almost literally from Zaira had nearly > "driven him crazy." The sheer volume of common material in these two operas > ensures that dramatic resemblance between the recycled melodies in I > Capuleti and their original incarnations in Zaira will be the exception > rather than the rule. Smart then provides one specific example whereby word metering (the number of syllables for each line, traditionally written in a specific meter by the poet—the librettist—of from five to eight or more to each line of verse) is changed to work in the new context:: Gossett defines the poetic metering > What are we to make of Bellini's decision to bring back the cabaletta for > the prima donna soprano in Zaira, a number whose prevailing sentiment is > giddy anticipation of an imminent wedding, as Romeo's lamenting slow > movement in the last act of I Capuleti, sung over Juliet's inanimate body? > Not only is one of Bellini's most frivolous soprano cabalettas pressed into > service as a monologue confronting death, but the number is transferred from > the female to the male lead (although both roles are sung by female voices, > since the role of Romeo is written for a mezzo-soprano). And as if to > emphasize the violence of the transformation, the poetic texts are in > different verse meters—Zaira's cabaletta in settenari,: set in 6, 7 , 8 > syllables per line Romeo's in the less common quinari: five syllables to the > line. The means by which Bellini and Romani stretched Romeo's quinari lines > to fit a melody originally conceived for settenari is ingenious, achieved > simply by inserting word repetitions between the second and third syllables > of each line. ==Recordings== Year Cast (Romeo, Giulietta, Tebaldo, Capellio, Lorenzo) Conductor, opera house and orchestra LabelRecordings of I Capuleti e i Montecchi on operadis-opera-discography.org.uk 1958 Fiorenza Cossotto, Antonietta Pastori, Renato Gavarini, Vittorio Tatozzi, Ivo Vinco Lorin Maazel, RAI Orchestra and Chorus, Rome (Recording of a performance broadcast on 23 October) CD: Myto Cat: 00166 1966 Giacomo Aragall, Margherita Rinaldi, Luciano Pavarotti, Nicola Zaccaria, Walter Monachesi Claudio Abbado, Den Haag Orchestra and Teatro Comunale di Bologna Chorus, Den Haag CD: Opera Magic's Cat: OM24162 1968 Giacomo Aragall, Renata Scotto, Luciano Pavarotti, Agostino Ferrin, Alfredo Giacomotti Claudio Abbado, Teatro alla Scala Orchestra and Chorus, Milano (Recording of a performance broadcast on 8 January) CD: Opera Depot Cat: 11160-2 1975 Janet Baker, Beverly Sills, Nicolai Gedda, Robert Lloyd, Raimund Herincx Giuseppe Patanè, New Philharmonia Orchestra and the John Alldis Choir CD: EMI Cat: 5 86055-2 1984 Agnes Baltsa, Edita Gruberová, Dano Raffanti, Gwynne Howell, John Tomlinson Riccardo Muti, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden Orchestra and Chorus CD: EMI Cat: 5 09144 1997 Vesselina Kasarova, Eva Mei, Ramón Vargas, Umberto Chiummo, Simone Alberghini Roberto Abbado, Munich Radio Orchestra and Chorus CD: RCA Victor Cat: 09026 68899-2 1998 Jennifer Larmore, Hei-Kyung Hong, Paul Groves, Raymond Aceto, Robert Lloyd Donald Runnicles, Scottish Chamber Orchestra and Chorus CD: Teldec Cat: 3984-21472-2 2005 Clara Polito, Patrizia Ciofi, Danilo Formaggio, Federico Sacchi, Nicolo Amodio Luciano Acocella, Orchestra Internazionale d'Italia CD: Dynamic CDS 504/1-2; DVD: Dynamic 33504 2008 Elīna Garanča, Anna Netrebko, Joseph Calleja, Tiziano Bracci, Robert Gleadow Fabio Luisi, Vienna Symphony and the Wiener Singakademie Recorded in the Vienna Konzerthaus, April CD: Deutsche Grammophon Cat: 477 8031 2014 Vivica Genaux, Valentina Farcas, Davide Giusti, Fabrizio Beggi, Ugo Guagliardo Fabio Biondi, Europa Galante and the Belcanto Chorus Recorded in Rieti (Teatro Flavio Vespasiano), Italy, in September 2014 CD: Glossa Music Cat: GCD 923404 2016 Joyce DiDonato, Olga Kulchynska, Benjamin Bernheim, Alexei Botnarciuc, Roberto Lorenzi Fabio Luisi, Opernhaus Zürich orchestra and chorus Christof Loy, stage director DVD:Accentus Cat:ACC10353 ==References== Notes Sources * *Maguire, Simon; Forbes, Elizabeth; Budden, Julian (1998), "I Capuleti e I Montecchi", in Stanley Sadie, (ed.), The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, vol. 1.

30684108	I Can (Blue song)	"I Can" is a song released by British boy group Blue, taken from their fourth studio album, Roulette. It was the United Kingdom's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2011, in Düsseldorf, Germany. It was written by group members Duncan James and Lee Ryan with Ciaron Bell, Ben Collieer, Ian Hope, Liam Keenan, and NoThwegian production team StarSign. "I Can" finished in 11th place and scored 100 points. It peaked at number sixteen on the UK Singles Chart, and reached the top ten in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It also charted in Belgium, Ireland, and Scotland. ==Critical reception== Digital Spy gave the song three stars out of five, and wrote: "I've never lost anything quite like this/ No second chances if I don't find it," the band continue over juddering synths that give way to a fist-clenching, Blue for 2011 chorus that sadly just misses the spot - the watered down production suggesting they aren't as cocksure of this plan as they claim. [...] Still - call them crazy, but there's enough here to suggest they might just pull the whole thing off." ==Promotion== During an appearance on BBC Breakfast on 9 February 2011, Blue confirmed that the song was written before they were asked to represent the UK in Düsseldorf, and described it as "a mix of pop, anthem and typically Blue sounding". On 12 February 2011, Blue began their promotional tour with an appearance on Malta Eurosong 2011. As 'I Can' had not yet finished production, the group sang their previous hit "If You Come Back". This was followed by another guest appearance, singing "Breathe Easy" on the Spanish national final Destino Eurovisión on 18 February. The band performed the song for the first time on 11 March 2011 on The Graham Norton Show. A promotional video for the song has also been released by BBC One with the blue London skyline in the background. They appeared at various events including at Comic Relief Does Glee Club on 17 March 2011 and on the Italian version of Top of the Pops on 21 March. The official music video was launched on 14 April 2011. The BBC aired a special one-hour documentary entitled Eurovision: Your Country Needs Blue on 16 April 2011, to mark their preparations for the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest. The single was released on 1 May 2011. Blue also appeared nude in British gay monthly Attitude in the magazine's annual Naked issue. Blue was featured both on the cover and in an inside major article in promotion of the British bid to Eurovision. Blue performed the song on Paul O'Grady Live on 29 April and on the So You Think You Can Dance UK results show. == Eurovision Song Contest == It was the first time in Eurovision Song Contest history that the British entry has been decided internally by the BBC. An announcement was made on 29 January 2011 through the BBC News and official Eurovision Song Contest websites. It finished in 11th place in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011. Bulgaria gave the song 12 points (the highest possible score), Italy 10 points, Malta 7 and Turkey 6. Overall, if the jury vote had not been counted the song would have finished in 5th place as it did from televotes. ==Track listing== Notes * signifies an additional producer ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Weekly chart performance for "I Can" Chart (2011) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Year-end chart performance for "I Can" Chart (2011) Position Germany (Official German Charts) 63 ==Release history== Release dates and formats for "I Can" Region Date Format(s) Label Ref United Kingdom 1 May 2011 Digital download Blueworld 2 May 2011 CD single Germany 13 May 2011 Digital download Island Records CD single ==References== Category:Eurovision songs of 2011 Category:Eurovision songs of the United Kingdom Category:2011 singles Category:Blue (English band) songs Category:Dance-pop songs Category:Songs written by Lee Ryan Category:Songs written by Duncan James Category:2011 songs

30820584	I Am Very Far	I Am Very Far is the sixth album by Okkervil River, released on May 10, 2011. It was produced primarily in Austin, Connecticut and Brooklyn by lead singer Will Sheff with John Congleton and Phil Palazzolo. ==Recording and production== I Am Very Far marked a distinct break from the polished, hyper- literary folk-rock that Okkervil River had explored on their previous two albums, The Stage Names and The Stand Ins. In the words of songwriter Will Sheff, "I found myself wanting to not be accessible and not be crowd pleasing and basically be self-pleasing and follow what I thought was really interesting." This is the first Okkervil River album that Sheff produced, following his production of Roky Erickson's 2010 album True Love Cast Out All Evil. From this experience, Sheff attests to gaining "a kind of chaotic, powerful energy that swirls around Roky that I started to feel infecting my own writing and my own sonic ideas and desires." In studio, the band experimented with various recording methods in each session, including fastforwarding and rewinding a cassette tape and then doubling the noises on electric guitar, tearing off strips of duct tape for percussion, singing while strolling around the room, and hurling file-cabinets across the studio. Some songs had input from a vast number of session musicians playing in the same room, such as "Rider" or "We Need a Myth," the latter of which opens with the strumming of 45 classical guitars. Lyrically, I Am Very Far is also a sharp departure from their previous work. Whereas previous albums were often composed of highly literate takes on rock legends and tropes, this album's lyrics tend to portray dark and indistinct dreamscapes. Sheff explained that "interiority is a really important thing to me, and a lot of this record did come from a subconscious, unconscious place, and I wanted it to respond to that corresponding place in listeners... I wanted it to really feel like it was operating on a subterranean level."Skinner, James. Interview: Okkervil River’s Will Sheff, Very Far . Drowned in Sound. 25 April 2011. Retrieved 19 July 2011. ==Reception== I Am Very Far has received mostly positive reviews. On the review aggregate site Metacritic, the album has a score of 80 out of 100, indicating "Generally favorable reviews."Critic Reviews for I Am Very Far. Metacritic. Retrieved 26 June 2011 Sputnikmusic wrote "I Am Very Far is certainly a more enthralling listen than The Stand Ins was; though it may lack some of the emotional impact of Down the River of Golden Dreams, or especially Black Sheep Boy, the album remains a welcomed addition into the work of a band who commands great quality-control."Okkervil River - I Am Very Far (staff review). Sputnikmusic. 10 May 2011. Retrieved 19 July 2011. Jim Scott of Under the Radar called the album "...one of the best records of the year," writing "I Am Very Far makes a strong case for Sheff to be considered one of the very best writers in music today." Scott concluded: "...looking at this stretch of recordings with such a finite lens is doing them a disservice: this is music to cherish forever." Some reviewers praised the band for pursuing a new sound on the album, with Erik Adams of The A.V. Club writing "It’s no longer the Okkervil River of The Stage Names or Black Sheep Boy, and that’s a plus: I Am Very Far signals that the band’s gifts with song and sentiment were never tied to specificity." Slant Magazine's Jaymie Baxley also gave the album a positive review, writing "Fans who approach I Am Very Far carrying expectations informed by the group's earlier releases will no doubt find this to be Okkervil River's most challenging work to date, but it's also the group's most grandiose, thrilling, and brilliant." Tiny Mix Tapes, on the other hand, was less receptive to the band's new sound, writing "But rather than serve as a radical departure for Okkervil River, I Am Very Far treads familiar ground with a superficial extroversion that can't match the emotional particularity of the rest of the band's back catalog."Okkervil River - I Am Very Far. Tiny Mix Tapes. Retrieved 19 July 2011. In another mixed review, Philip Cosores of One Thirty BPM called I Am Very Far Okkervil River's "...weakest album to date." Cosores continued: "I Am Very Far is often a noisy album, seeming experimental, but ultimately just poorly edited, with the songs overly busy and taking the focus away from the songwriting and lyrics that are Sheff’s strengths."Cosores, Philip.

30873788	I Am Weasel	I Am Weasel is an American animated television series created by David Feiss for Cartoon Network and produced at Hanna-Barbera. It is the fourth of the network's Cartoon Cartoons. The series centers on I.M. Weasel (voiced by Michael Dorn), a smart, noble, and successful weasel, I.R. Baboon (voiced by Charlie Adler), an unintelligent and rude baboon who is envious of Weasel and acts as both his rival and friend, and the mischievous Red Guy (also voiced by Adler), who often antagonizes the two. I Am Weasel originally aired as a segment of Cow and Chicken from 1997 to 1999, often airing as the third of three segments in an episode, and was eventually spun off into its own series. A fifth season with 27 new episodes aired from June 10, 1999, to 2000 and joined the original 52 which were previously part of Cow and Chicken. The entire series includes 79 episodes overall. == Premise == The series chronicles the random adventures of two animal frenemies: I.M. Weasel (Michael Dorn) and I.R. Baboon (Charlie Adler). The first one is a famous, heroic, eloquent, highly intelligent and very talented least weasel who always tries to help people out and is thus adored by everybody, constantly shouting his catchphrase "I am Weasel!" while pointing high in the air before going after help.Opening sequence of I Am Weasel The latter is his foil, an ugly and idiotic hamadryas baboon who is envious of Weasel's success and constantly tries to do better than he does (also doing a victory dance to express his joy when thinking he is doing so), and failing miserably after all due to his total stupidity. Starting from season two, the Red Guy (Charlie Adler), a main character in Cow and Chicken, also gets that role in I Am Weasel, where he is also referred to as "I.B. Red Guy", an allusion to Weasel's and Baboon's names. His addition to the series makes him gradually take the role of villain from I.R., who becomes more friendly to Weasel, despite still despising him. As the series progresses, I.M. Weasel, initially showed as an invincible hero, gradually loses the focus to I.R. Baboon, because people are shown to get gradually dumber, sometimes being manipulated by the Red Guy into doing that. In the series finale, I.R. is finally presented as the true star of the show instead of him. Supporting characters include Loulabelle (Susanne Blakeslee, Teresa Ganzel), Jolly Roger (Dee Bradley Baker) and Admiral Bullets (Jess Harnell, Michael Gough). Many characters from Cow and Chicken make cameo appearances in I Am Weasel from season two, these include: Cow, Chicken (Charlie Adler), Mom, Teacher (Candi Milo), Dad (Dee Bradley Baker), Flem (Howard Morris), and Earl (Dan Castellaneta). === Universe setting === While season one does not have any link to Cow and Chicken universe, from season two, I Am Weasel usually happens in the same universe of that show, as its characters (mainly the Red Guy) usually appear, but, most of the time, in different places. David Feiss, in fact, cross-populated both series as it made the work easier and he felt it was always the same universe. An episode, though, does present I Am Weasel as a TV show airing in Cow and Chicken world, suggesting another universe, but Weasel and I.R. are both taken out of TV after all. The same occurs in another episode, but with the characters in the same universe. === Characters === thumb|left|240px|The central characters: I.M. Weasel (right) and I.R. Baboon (left). * I.M. Weasel (Michael Dorn): A highly intelligent, skilled and famous weasel who mostly plays a straight man role in a world full of idiots. While very helpful and beloved at the beginning of the series, he eventually starts to show frustration with people's antics and his "hero" status towards them becomes more fallible. * I.R. Baboon (Charlie Adler): A dimwitted and jealous baboon, he eventually becomes Weasel's best friend. Shown in the beginning as trying to persuade people's attention from Weasel, always failing miserably and being hated, he eventually gets a "hero" status as the world becomes just as stupid as him. He is known for his habit of going into a rage if people laugh at his buttocks. Always wears a white t-shirt with an upside-down "I.R." written by himself on it. He's said to be 40 years old in the episode "I.R.'s First Bike". * The Red Guy (Charlie Adler): Also cited as "I.B. Red Guy", he's a comical devil character who presents himself with a different personality each episode he appears, similar to Cow and Chicken, trying to persuade and scam the central characters. He may sometimes play as a third main character. * Jolly Roger (Dee Bradley Baker): A fat and tall man who always wears a tuxedo along a sailor costume, named after the pirate flag. * Loulabelle (Susanne Blakeslee / Teresa Ganzel): An assistant woman to Weasel, a blonde nurse. Also shown as laboratory assistant in one episode. Implied as Weasel's girlfriend in seasons two and three. * Admiral Bullets (Jess Harnell / Michael Gough): A short-sized admiral always seen standing up over a small bench. He appears only in the early seasons calling up for Weasel's help. * Cow and Chicken characters: Usually appear on cameos or crossovers, either as part of the show or of their own universe, more often in later seasons. These include Cow and Chicken, their parents and teacher and Flem and Earl. == Development and production == === Creation and concept === Cow and Chicken started out as the pilot episode "No Smoking" on What a Cartoon! in 1995, and was greenlit to become a series. Cartoon Network demanded a second cartoon to join Cow and Chicken in its half- hour time slot, so David Feiss came up with I Am Weasel, loosely based upon the novel I Am Legend, one of his favorite books as a teenager. "I was doodling one day, and drew a weasel, with the title 'I Am Weasel', off of one of my favorite books as a teenager, Richard Matheson's I Am Legend. I thought against type, that instead of a weasel who was a weasel, this guy would be smart and heroic". According to Feiss, the idea for creating the show began as a single drawing of I.M. Weasel with the caption "I Am Weasel" and that suggested many stories to him. The concept for the rivalry between a weasel and a baboon came up from the classic nursery rhyme "Pop Goes the Weasel", where a monkey is said to be chasing a weasel. Also, the fact that the Red Guy does not wear pants was controversial for many people, as he said: "The thing that I never thought that I'd get approval for was the Red Guy. The mere fact that he didn't wear pants was a challenge for a lot of people and I am glad Cartoon Network let it go - he's my favorite character". Production began around April 1996 and the show was inserted as a series of segments in Cow and Chicken until mid 1999. Right after the end of that show, it was spun-off into a new separated series produced until September 16, 1999, with all the previous episodes incorporated and removed from Cow and Chicken. General production took place at the studio of Hanna-Barbera, in Los Angeles, with the series being labeled as part of both the collection of cartoons of that company and Cartoon Network's Cartoon Cartoons. Animation production was made overseas by Rough Draft Korea, in Seoul. === Retooling === From season two onward, the show's story, recurring characters and art style underwent significant changes. I.R. Baboon went on to become gradually more friendly to Weasel and less seen as antagonist, as that role was taken over by the Red Guy. Supporting characters from seasons one to three, such as Loulabelle and Admiral Bullets, became less and less seen, completely being absent in seasons four and five. Many characters from Cow and Chicken were added as supporting or recurring characters. That was explained by Feiss: "There was a lot of pressure to complete Cow and Chicken quickly, and I felt that I couldn't dedicate enough time to the second show. But Cartoon Network wanted to spin off Weasel, so we did. I don't really remember asking if I could or could not cross populate the two shows--I just did it because it felt like the same universe, plus I thought it was funny to have the Red Guy in I Am Weasel". The story started to show more of Weasel's shortcomings and at times allowed him to lapse into a wise fool, suffering similar gags as I.R., as opposed of the invincible folk hero role he played on season one.I Am Weasel - Seasons 2 to 5. I.R. Baboon started to become more like a hero than a villain, also taking that role from Weasel in some episodes of season five, leading to the finale. The show never truly dropped its premise of Weasel serving to contrast Baboon's stupidity and failures (the very thing that allowed Baboon to usurp him in the final episode as the key piece of the entertainment) and that Weasel retained more than enough intelligence and morality to serve as his defining characteristics, among the cast. The exact same art style of Cow and Chicken is used starting from season two. Season one is a bit different, including the title cards for episodes, which feature animation and Weasel saying the name of the episode with additional commentary and/or events, contrasting with the style also used for Cow and Chicken, with static image.I Am Weasel - Season 1. === Humor style === Humor relies on slapstick comedy and moderate off-color humor, as typical of many 1990s cartoons, and is based on the existent gap between the central characters, with I.R. Baboon being the center of most running jokes, which are mostly about his stupidity and big red butt, though some episodes show I.M. Weasel or the Red Guy also taking this role. Butt jokes are also more frequent when the Red Guy is around and parodies of popular culture and other shows and crossovers also take place in some episodes. Despite all the comedic style, important and meaningful messages about friendship, social differences and general lessons for life are given to children through stories or when I.M. Weasel directly talks to the audience. Season one shows Weasel as a "perfect" character, not leaving a single shortcoming, and Baboon as exact opposite to this, but that gradually changes throughout the series, with Weasel later starting to show some misbehavior and inefficiency, mostly because he notices people around him are getting dumber, and thus I.R. even being dimwitted gets a hero status. From season two onward, the Red Guy incorporates the style of humor found in Cow and Chicken, taking the role of villain, but also appearing as a third wheel. In season five, Jolly Roger also starts to fill both roles. Episodes usually reference the show name and I.M. Weasel with titles in first person, and a great number of them also make fun of I.R. Baboon's misspelling, with grammatically incorrect names such as "I Big Star", "I Good Salesmans" and "I Artiste". The fourth wall is often broken, mostly at the end of episodes. The characters do it to make some ending commentaries, give advice to spectators or just call for the end of the episode. === Title, credits and music === The title sequence features I.M. Weasel constantly saying his catchphrase "I am Weasel!" and I.R. Baboon doing his trademarked victory dance. The series ending credits were only created in 1999, with the separation; it credits all involved in the three years of production and the theme song is played instrumentally in a pop rock style, with additional arrangement like orchestrations.I Am Weasel ending credits. The theme song was composed by Bill Fulton, written by Richard Pursel, and sung by April March. It is a humorous take on the well-known version of "Pop Goes the Weasel". === Voice cast === Michael Dorn provided voice for I.M. Weasel and Charlie Adler did both voices of I.R. Baboon and the Red Guy. Loulabelle was voiced by Susanne Blakeslee in season two and Teresa Ganzel in season three, Jolly Roger by Dee Bradley Baker, and Admiral Bullets by Jess Harnell in season one and Michael Gough in season two. Feiss originally considered James Earl Jones for the role of I.M. Weasel since he was the announcer of Cartoon Network's sister channel CNN, but Dorn was recommended to him by his friend and Johnny Bravo creator Van Partible. Additional characters were voiced by the aforementioned along with Carlos Alazraqui, Dan Castellaneta, Dom DeLuise, Tom Kenny, Candi Milo, Howard Morris and Frank Welker, among others. Guest stars include Phyllis Diller, Mark Hamill, Ed McMahon, Laraine Newman, Jeremy Piven, George Segal, Susan Tyrell and Mary Woronov. == Broadcast == === Broadcast history === A sneak peek for the series was aired on July 15, 1997, with the eleventh episode, "Law of Gravity", and then it started its original run from July 22, 1997 with the second episode, "I.R. on Sun", all yet as a series of segments on Cow and Chicken. After four seasons, it was separated and premiered as a half-hour show on June 10, 1999, and the 52 episodes originally aired on Cow and Chicken began to air on the show's own time slot, being either in or outside the Cartoon Cartoon Fridays programming block, and getting joined by 27 new episodes, totaling 79. The original run ended in early 2000. Reruns aired prominently from early 2000 to 2002, including on Cartoon Cartoon Fridays. From September 2005 to June 2006, it returned sporadically as segments on The Cartoon Cartoon Show, along with other Cartoon Cartoons from that era. On April 13, 2012, the series returned on Cartoon Planet before being removed in 2013. It was also aired on Boomerang, but only with seasons 1 to 4 along the Cow and Chicken segments, and on Cartoon Network Too in the United Kingdom. Some episodes were also made available on Cartoon Network Video in the early 2010s. From June 25, 2017, season one was made available on Netflix in Australia, along Cow and Chicken. It started to be available worldwide on HBO Max from 2022 onward. The show is rated TV-Y7 in the United States, and G (General) in both Australia and New Zealand. ==== Brazilian miniseries ==== In Brazil, an animated miniseries named Terra à Vista ("Land in Sight") was produced in 2000 for Cartoon Network, and tells the story of the Portuguese arriving at Brazil with a humorous take, using characters from Cartoon Cartoons, including I.M. Weasel, I.R. Baboon and the Red Guy. It was broadcast on Cartoon Network Brazil from March 6 to April 22, 2000 and has 8 episodes. This series was also the first-ever Cartoon Network production exclusively made for Brazil. === Episodes === The series consists of five seasons and 79 episodes. The first four seasons contain the segments that originally aired during broadcasts of Cow and Chicken, while the fifth contains a further 27 episodes produced independently of that show. They were all eventually mend up into the whole I Am Weasel series, although they still air sometimes within Cow and Chicken timeslots. There was a small case of censorship in the episode "I.R. Mommy", in which the letter "N", present on an American football helmet used by I.R. Baboon (a reference to the Nebraska Cornhuskers), had to be digitally removed in 1999 after Cartoon Network was sued by the University of Nebraska, who alleged the reference was derogatory for their institution. No other episode suffered censorship so far. === Ratings === It became one of the most successful Cartoon Network original series of its time, usually being remembered along other major Cartoon Cartoons and recording high ratings for the network in both incarnations of season one and seasons two to five. The premiere of season five on June 10, 1999, reached 1.8 million viewers in households, acquiring 4.4 with kids 2-11 and 4.6 with kids 6-11. It was also the fifth most watched show on Cartoon Network in 2000, with an average rating of 1.8 million viewers, only and not far behind The Powerpuff Girls (1.9), Tom and Jerry (2.0), Courage the Cowardly Dog (2.1) and Dexter's Laboratory (2.3). Back in 1997 and 1998, I Am Weasel along Cow and Chicken, Johnny Bravo and Dexter's Laboratory, were responsible for increasing Cartoon Network's average ratings. == Merchandise == === Home media === Both VHS and DVD releases have been produced for the series. Although no official media containing complete seasons has been released in the United States as of 2022, a Cartoon Cartoons VHS from 1998 dedicated to the show contains the episodes "My Friend, the Smart Banana", "I.R.

30905589	I Am Woman (Jordin Sparks song)	"I Am Woman" is a song performed by American recording artist Jordin Sparks. The up-tempo song was written by Ali Pierre Gaschani, Dean Josiah and Ryan Tedder, who also produced the track. "I Am Woman" premiered online via AOL Music on May 5, 2011, and was later officially released in the United States on May 10, 2011. The song's lyrics contain a message towards female empowerment, which talks about different aspects of the lives of women. "I Am Woman" received a positive reception from most music critics, who complimented its differences with any of Sparks' previous singles, as well as noting its similarities to the sounds of American R&B; singer Beyoncé. ==Background== "I Am Woman" premiered online via AOL Music on May 5, 2011. It was written by Ali Pierre, Dean Josiah and Ryan Tedder, who also produced the track. "I Am Woman" was made available for download on iTunes Stores worldwide on May 6, 2011, and later in the United States on May 10, 2011. On speaking about the song, Sparks said "I Am Woman is a song about different aspects of the lives of women. It could be a mother, a performer, a woman working in a corporate space — it's all about what we go through as women and how our lives are so crazy. Walk a mile in my shoes, or in my stilettos, if you dare and see what happens. It's all about the strengths that a woman has: how we can multitask and carry so much, yet still always be on point when we need to be and on cue when we need to be. It's all about the amazingness of a woman." ==Critical reception== Following its release, "I Am Woman" was well received by most music critics. Becky Bain of Idolator wrote "This somewhat experimental, hand-clapping, high energy woman-power track is the most bangin' thing we've heard from Jordin, well, maybe ever. It makes us want to strap on our stilettos and wobble-strut all over the dancefloor!." Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio Blog said the track shows a "new side" to Sparks, and added that she "sings with a feisty attitude, leaving her sweet disposition at the door." Jason Lipshutz of Billboard called it "empowering". James Dinh of MTV Newsroom wrote, "Sparks has taken to her music as a venue to rejoice in her coming-of-age growth and maturity". Many critics also noted the song's similarities to the sounds of American R&B; singer Beyoncé. A writer for WPLJ said "I Am Woman" "is a forceful dance track that's a female empowerment anthem very reminiscent of Beyoncé." Jarett Wieselman of New York Post, described the song as a "pre-teen version" of Beyoncé's "Run the World (Girls)" (2011). Gil Kaufman of MTV News called it a "Beyoncé-like R&B; jam". ==Chart performance== For the issue dated May 19, 2011, "I Am Woman" debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number eighty-two with 33,000 downloads sold. As of September 2014, the video has not been released. ==Live performances== On May 12, 2011, Sparks performed "I Am Woman" live for the first time on the tenth season of American Idol. She wore a silver metallic trench coat and black heels for the first half of the performance, and was accompanied by female back-up dancers. During the second half, Sparks removed the coat to reveal a black, body-skimming, dress, and the female dancers were replaced by male dancers. Sparks performed the song on Live With Regis and Kelly on June 14.

31012479	I Am Giant	I Am Giant is a rock band based in London, United Kingdom. They formed in West Auckland, New Zealand in late 2008 and released their debut album The Horrifying Truth on 1 August 2011 in Australia and New Zealand, where it has been certified Gold and delivered four Rock Chart No. 1's. The album was released in Asia on 23 March 2012, and in Europe and US on 8 October 2012. The band was formed by New Zealanders Shelton Woolright, Paul Matthews, who then recruited Brit Ed Martin. Drummer Shelton Woolright had been with Blindspott, the only rock band in New Zealand music history to have both their debut and follow up albums enter the charts at number 1 until NZ band Devilskin also took that honour in 2016. Bassist Paul Matthews credits include Tadpole, and more recently Stylus. Matthews is also a producer/engineer and has worked on high-profile kiwi artists including producing Blindspott's debut album. With Woolright they co-produced Six60's single "Rise Up 2.0" which has now gone double platinum. The band have had tracks featured on extreme sports DVDs including Quiksilver Euroforce Surfing Videos, Mormail Brazilian surfing label's DVD through South America and North America, White Lines magazine in Europe, and 2009 film Cloud 9 (the Kelly Slater story). The band is sponsored by Gibson Guitars. In December 2014 Ed Martin left the band to embark on a solo project which is to be produced by Paul Matthews. ==History== ===Formation and City Limits/Neon Sunrise EP (2008–2010)=== After Blindspott played their final concert in 2007, Shelton Woolright and fellow Kiwi Paul Matthews moved to London to look at starting a band in the UK. Matthews and Woolright auditioned over 150 singers and 120 guitarists before coming across Ed Martin and Max O'Donnell. In 2010 Aja Timu who had played with Matthews (Stylus) and Woolright (Blindspott) replaced Max O'Donnell on guitars. The band became the Quiksilver Ambassadors for Europe which led to a number of festivals and events including Brixton's Skate and BMX Jam, Quiksilver's 'Chromataphobia' and the Quiksilver Pro Tour in Biarritz, France. In March the band sold out its first tour in New Zealand. In May I Am Giant performed at two Tiger Translate parties in Vietnam before returning for gigs in France, London, and Liverpool (Sound City showcase). They then toured New Zealand, Australia and America through June, July and August, before returning to the UK to play at the British Surf Champs and an encore performance at the Quiksilver Pro Tour in Biarritz, France. In May the band recorded an acoustic cover of Slipknot's single "Duality" for New Zealand's The Rock Radio's Night show segment "Like a Version". The song was released as a free download from the band's website in September 2012. The City Limits/Neon Sunrise EP was released on 26 March 2010 and saw success in the New Zealand Charts and high rotation on the New Zealand radio stations. The EP received Gold certification. ===The Horrifying Truth (2011–2012)=== The band spent most of the early months of 2011 in Australia, working on their debut album. Between January and April 2011 The Horrifying Truth was recorded with acclaimed Australian alternative rock producer/engineer Forrester Savell. The album was recorded between Sony Studios in Sydney, and Forrester's studio at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne. It was co-produced by Matthews and Woolright. During this period, I Am Giant also supported Slash and Stone Temple Pilots during the Big Night Out concert in Singapore. The Horrifying Truth was released on 1 August 2011. Three days later, the band started a nationwide tour in New Zealand, called 'The Horrifying Truth Tour', which was followed by concerts with Dead Letter Circus in Australia. At the beginning of 2012 guitarist Aja Timu left the band. Rather than replacing Timu immediately, the band brought in a variety of session guitarists for tours and recording including Andrew Kerr and Michael Triponel. I Am Giant started 2012 with another tour of New Zealand and Australia. They played at what was called the final New Zealand Big Day Out, where they also shot part of the music video for "Purple Heart", with fans holding up frames from the video, which had been shot a week earlier. The video featuring event sponsor's Speight's Summit Beer was debuted during the band's set later that day. That year the band toured Asia, including Manila, Bangkok, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. They were supporting Slash's tour in Australia, and a UK tour in support of the October 2012 UK release of The Horrifying Truth. During this tour the band released a German version of the I Am Giant EP, which included their cover of Slipknot's song "Duality" and a new track "Blood Money". I Am Giant also began working on tracks for their second album. In late December 2012 the band returned to New Zealand for a summer tour opening for New Zealand Rock Legends Shihad. The band debuted the live version of "Blood Money", which was shortly after made available on iTunes. ===Science & Survival and The X Factor NZ (2013–2015)=== 2013 started with the completion of the Shihad tour and a small tour of Australia. I Am Giant also headlined a free concert held by the Auckland Council as part of the council's Music In Parks summer events. I Am Giant were again in the line-up for Homegrown's Rock Stage, where it was announced that the band would be heading to France in May to record the new album. In June the band started the recording of their unnamed second album at the Drop In Music Studio in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France. Andrew Kerr did not travel for the recording, Michael Triponel and bassist Paul Matthews filled in on guitars. As with The Horrifying Truth, Forrester Savell is producing the album. Two singles were released ahead of the album release, "Razor Wire Reality" and "Death of You". The album, Science & Survival, was released on 4 July 2014. "Transmission" and "Standing on the Sun" were released after the tour of New Zealand. Both songs were put onto high rotation on Rock radio stations in New Zealand. On December 15 I Am Giant released for free download the new song "Russian Doll" which is the first song to feature new singer Ryan Redman. On March 19, 2015, it was announced that Woolright would be replacing Willy Moon as a judge on The X Factor New Zealand, after Moon was fired. On May 7, 2015 I Am Giant released a new single, "Kiss From A Ghost", which rose to #1 on the New Zealand iTunes charts following their live performance of the single on the second series of the New Zealand version of The X Factor on May 17. ===Life in Captivity (2016–present)=== In March 2016, I Am Giant performed at Homegrown with long time lead guitarist Aja Timu taking the lead vocals position. According to Woolright this was the logical choice upon the departure of Redman as many fans had previously mentioned how good Aja was on backing vocals. The change to Timu as lead singer also lead to the addition of a second guitarist on tour bringing a new dimension to the band's live performances The remainder of 2016 was fairly quiet for I Am Giant as they spent most of the year writing and recording for the third album due for release in late 2017. In February 2017, I Am Giant released their first single featuring Timu on vocals, "Dead Flower" followed by "Playing with Fire" in mid-2017 and "Don't Look Back" in February 2018. The album, Life in Captivity, reportedly I Am Giant's last, was released on 16 March 2018. ==Band members== Current members * Aja Timu – vocals, guitar (2010–2012, 2014, 2016–present) * Andrew Kerr – guitars (2012–present) * Paul Matthews – bass guitar, backup vocals, album guitars (2008–present) * Shelton Woolright – drums (2008–present) Touring members * Michael Triponel – guitars (2013–2014) Former members * Max O'Donnell – guitars (2008–2010) * Ed Martin – vocals (2008–2014) * Michael Triponel – guitars (2013–2014) * Ryan Redman – vocals (2014–2015) * Stuart Steele – lead guitars (2014–2015) ===Timeline=== == Discography == I Am Giant's discography features three studio albums, two extended plays (EPs) and nine singles. ===Studio albums=== Year Album Peak chart positions Certification NZ 2011 The Horrifying Truth * Released: 1 August 2011 * Label: Giant Sound/Sony Music 2 * NZ: Gold 2014 Science & Survival * Released: 4 July 2014 * Label: Giant Sound/Sony Music 2 2018 Life in Captivity * Released: 16 March 2018 * Label: Giant Sound 26 ===Extended plays=== Year Album Peak chart positions Certification NZ 2010 City Limits / Neon Sunrise * Released: 26 March 2010 * Label: Giant Sound/Sony Music 18 * NZ: Gold 2012 I Am Giant * German release * Released: 30 November 2012 * Label: Giant Sound/Sony Music — "—" denotes a release that did not chart. ===Singles=== I Am Giant's first single "City Limits" was a hit on rock radio in New Zealand, being on A Rotate for nearly five months and, at number 10, was the only new entry in the Rock's Top 20 Best Kiwi Songs of All Time.

31080363	I Am Rembrandt's Daughter	I Am Rembrandt's Daughter is a 2007, young adult historical fiction novel by Lynn Cullen about the famous artist Rembrandt van Rijn's daughter Cornelia van Rijn (1654-1684). In Cullen's version of the story, Cornelia finds that she is not Rembrandt's daughter, but rather that of Nicolaes Bruyningh, the subject of one of Rembrandt's paintings. The novel was selected by YALSA as one of the Best Books for Young Adults in 2008. ==Summary== The novel is told through a series of flashbacks describing key parts from her childhood and most of her teenage life. During one of the first flashbacks of the novel, Cornelia is sent upstairs to put the cat in the attic when she unrolls a picture. When she realizes that the painting is her mother, nude, she becomes ashamed of her. As her mother appears in the doorway, she runs past her. In a flashback to her childhood, Cornelia is unknowingly introduced to her biological father. Around the age of five, Cornelia runs home crying because she has lied to her friend about having an ivory doll. When the Nicolaes, whom she calls Gold Mustache Man, walks past, she tells him what is wrong, and, some days later, she finds a doll sitting on her stoop, waiting for her. In her excitement, Cornelia runs to Rembrandt and tells him of what she has been given, but he takes the doll and sells it. Cornelia goes to her mother for comfort, which is something she does many times in the story. The day her mother dies, Cornelia goes to her mother's room and sees her lying in bed with the spots of the plague on her. Her father tells her to leave and throws her mother's beads at her. When Cornelia stumbles outside, the Gold Mustache Man walks towards her and when she tells him her mother is dead he runs away. At the beginning of the novel, Cornelia, the supposed daughter of Rembrandt, describes how she has never gotten a chance to experience the things her wealthier friends have been able to do. Throughout the story, it is shown how close Cornelia is to her older brother, Titus, and how much she would rather not be Rembrandt's daughter. Rembrandt, Titus, and Cornelia struggle with their lack of money, though Cornelia is the only one showing her dislike for being so “lowly”. When Titus announces that he is getting married, Cornelia is filled with a sense of loss at the idea of her brother leaving her. At the wedding, she sees a handsome boy, Carel, that she has trouble tearing her gaze from, until her father makes a scene when he sees the newlyweds’ portrait. When he makes the bride spill her last drop of wine, which was bad luck, he causes the ceremony to come to a halt. Cornelia follows her father home and expresses how she feels ashamed of him. Cornelia sees how her father calls out for Titus to come and view his work, but he never calls for her. When Rembrandt finishes his family portrait, Cornelia and Neel realize that he has painted the innocent eyes of the baby as Titus's. When Titus can't figure it out, Rembrandt drops the subject. Through the rest of the book, Cornelia thinks of how the men separate themselves through their art. Cornelia wishes her father would teach her the trade, but he never looks to her as someone to learn it. Over the days that follow the wedding, Rembrandt finishes a piece that he tries to sell. When he take Cornelia with him to a house he wants to use to sell the art, Carel answers the door and has to reject the painting. Titus makes Cornelia go back, without their father knowing, but the piece is rejected again. Carel seeing Cornelia twice, sparks something in him that makes him come to visit repeatedly throughout the story. Rembrandt has forbidden Cornelia to see Carel again. When Titus comes back into the picture, he announces that he and his wife Magdalena are going to have a baby. Unfortunately, Titus becomes ill and Cornelia is forced to go shopping with Magdalena. Magdalena shows Cornelia how little she cares about those who need to make a profit when she tells her she's going to buy twice as much fabric at a discount and then return the extra for full price. When Cornelia and Magdalena return to her home, they see Titus lying on the bed with the tokens of the plague right under his ear. At a stressful point in the waiting for Titus to pull through, Rembrandt sees the beads that were once Hendrickje's and kicks Cornelia out to go to Nicolaes. Cornelia runs out of the house, but runs to Carel, who won't take her in. As Cornelia backs away in tears, she bumps in Nicolaes, who takes her in to explain to her the truth about her life. Inside his home, he explains to her that he is her real father and that he left her mother because he had seen her posing nude for Rembrandt. When Cornelia realizes that Nicolaes never came for her because he would lose his money, she leaves and goes back to her brother. Rembrandt asks what he has told her and then tells her his side of the story and how he had promised her mother he would take care of her and Cornelia. When Titus dies, they have no money to pay for funeral bells, but for some reason they still ring. When Cornelia and Rembrandt get back to their home, they discover that Neel has paid for the bells to ring and that he does care for her and Rembrandt. The very end of the story is told in a present tense. Cornelia is selling her father's things when two men walk in and criticize his work, though not noticing her. When one of the men finally decides he wants a painting, she doesn't want to sell it. Out of the back room comes Neel, who says no to selling the painting, the secret between the two being that it is Cornelia's own original piece. ==Characters== *Cornelia, the main character of this book and the narrator, is the assumed daughter of the artist Rembrandt. All her life she tells, how she wishes she could have some of the things the richer kids could get, for example, she tells her friend that she has an ivory doll, but she really doesn't. She gets the taste of engaging with the higher class when a young, handsome man, Carel, starts to talk and visit her. She also has better skills for painting than her brother Titus. *Rembrandt, the father to Cornelia van Rijn and Titus van Rijn, is an outspoken old man. He stops being able to support his family when he takes up with Cornelia's mother. To make matters worse, he stops giving the customers what they want out of his art and makes lumpy, splotchy paintings. Rembrandt also takes care of Cornelia, though he is not her real father, but treats her as if she is his own. *Moeder (mother), Rembrandt's lover Hendrickje Stoffels, the maid, who is ridiculed for having a child out of wedlock, and the mother of Cornelia. Hendrickje dies in a flashback phase of the book. Throughout her adult life, she takes part in lying to Cornelia out of love. After Nicolaes leaves her when he has already impregnated her, she takes up with Rembrandt, who says he will “care for her”.Cullen, p. 277 *Gold Mustache Man or Nicolaes, a rich man that seems kind, is Cornelia's real father. He abandons his child because she is of a lower class than he is. Cornelia refers to him as the “Gold Mustache Man” as a child because of his golden, blonde hair and mustache. He figures it was better to leave Hendrickje rather than stay and help her, he justifies himself by asking Cornelia “[w]hat [he] would [have been] to [her] without [his] money”.Cullen, p. 270 *Neel, a serious young man that is Rembrandt's only student, is the man that sees Cornelia as someone great and loves her. Throughout the stages of Rembrandt's decline in popularity, Neel stays loyal to him, leaving himself as his last student. Neel values the company of Rembrandt and his daughter, but mostly Cornelia. He is useful as an assistant, but also as someone who can look beyond what's placed in front of him and analyze the depth of a picture or a situation. *Titus, the “brother” to Cornelia, is an ambitious and somewhat foolish man. He cares for his younger sister, but doesn't see things the way she sees them. Titus is more care free, but he is very dedicated to his family even after his father interrupted his wedding. *Carel, the handsome first cousin to Cornelia, is a self-centered character who only cares about his own well being, even when Cornelia needs him to take her in after her father kicks her out.Cullen, p. 256 *Magdalena, the rich wife of Titus, is a spoiled woman. She values her wealth and herself over her husband towards the end of the novel when “[s]he and her moeder [leave] for relatives in St. Annaparochie”Cullen, p. 274 when Titus gets sick. The main character puts Magdalena's lifestyle in perspective when she comments that Magdalena has “ a cook, a maid, and a mother to jump to her every command.”Cullen, p. 239 ==Reception== Reviewers have commented on the novel's emotional appeal. For instance, Gillian Engberg of Booklist commented that I Am Rembrandt’s Daughter is “noteworthy for emotional depth," adding that it is an "absorbing romantic story." Stephanie Murphy agreed, calling it an "emotionally touching book". The realism of the characters also impressed readers. Publishers Weekly noted it as "sensitively sketched first novel paints a compelling portrait of [Cornelia]", adding that it had "colorful cast." Booklist noted the novel's “heartbreaking individuals" and the author's "sensitive development of characters" and remarked that the novel is a “powerful family drama." Murphy reminded readers that it was "based on real [people]." Reviewers also pointed out the difference between this novel and most young adult fiction: its setting in a world of art history. One reviewer noted the author "uses paintings in effective ways to tether the story" and another commented on the novel's "highly atmospheric Dutch setting." Not all reviews were positive, however. Kirkus called the story “achingly familiar." ==References== ==Bibliography== Cullen, Lynn. I Am Rembrandt's Daughter.

31277017	I Am Chicago	I Am Chicago is a documentary photography and video project by Adam Novak and Sara Collins. It consists of full body portraits and video footage of pedestrians in thirty neighborhoods across Chicago, spanning the years of 2009–2011. It became a gallery of photographs and a website, showing the tremendous richness of the way that Chicagoans present themselves to the public. The gallery shows the faces, bodies, attitudes, clothes, accessories and tools of everyday life that people lug with them, morphing wildly from North to South, and East to West of Chicago. The photographers used a rental moving truck as a portrait studio, utilizing natural light from the translucent roof of the truck. Each neighborhood of Chicago is represented through a careful selection of portraits of its citizens as they passed the street corner studio in the course of a single day. To entice Chicagoans to pose, a professional studio portrait was printed on the spot and given to each participant for free. The project attracted the attention of the Chicago Reader in early 2011, when NBC 5 Chicago used the words "We Are Chicago" for their advertising campaign. NBC 5 ChicagoCromidas, Rachel.

31527744	I Am (2010 American documentary film)	I Am is a 2010 American documentary film written, directed, and narrated by Tom Shadyac. The film asks the question: "What is wrong with the world, and what can we do about it?", and explores Shadyac's personal journey after a bicycling accident in 2007 which led him to the answers "the nature of humanity", "the world's ever-growing addiction to materialism", and "human connections". Shot with Shadyac and a team of four, the film contrasts sharply with the director's most notable comedic works, such as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Liar Liar, and Bruce Almighty, all of which he collaborated with Canadian comic actor Jim Carrey. ==Background== Tom Shadyac suffered post- concussion syndrome after a bicycle accident in Virginia in 2007, experiencing months of acute headaches and hyper-sensitivity to light and noise. He slept in a closet due to chronic tinnitus that lasted more than six months. It was this constant ringing that the doctors could not treat that led him to suicidal thoughts. The injury followed the cumulative effects of previous mild head injuries Shadyac had suffered surfing, mountain biking and playing basketball. In 2011, a New York Times article stated that "the symptoms of a concussion [didn't] go away. Something as simple as a trip to the grocery store was painful for Shadyac, whose brain was unable to filter various stimuli. Shadyac subsequently gave away his excess fortune, opening a homeless shelter in Charlottesville, Virginia and making a key donation to Telluride, Colorado's effort to set aside a natural area at the town's entrance. He reoriented and simplified his life, sold his Los Angeles mansion and moved into a trailer park - albeit the exclusive Paradise Cove park in Malibu. As medical treatments failed to help, he isolated himself completely, sleeping in his closet and walling the windows of his mobile home with black-out curtains. Later, as his symptoms finally began to subside, the director wanted to share his inner quest in the way he knew best: through film." Shadyac linked the experience to Dante's Seventh Circle of Hell. ==Film context== In the film, Shadyac conducts interviews with scientists, religious leaders, environmentalists and philosophers including Desmond Tutu, Noam Chomsky, Lynne McTaggart, Elisabet Sahtouris, David Suzuki, Howard Zinn, and Thom Hartmann. The film asks two central questions: What’s Wrong With the World? and What Can We Do About it?. It is about "human connectedness, happiness, and the human spirit", and explores themes including Darwinism, Western mores, loneliness, the economy, and the drive to war. The documentary includes animated scenes explaining scientific concepts, as well as clips from the films Wall Street and It's a Wonderful Life. Proceeds from the documentary went to the Foundation for I Am, which supports various charities. ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 36% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 5.16/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "I Am is undeniably well-meaning - and unfortunately proof that a filmmaker's best intentions aren't enough to guarantee a worthwhile viewing experience." On Metacritic the film has a score of 38 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". The Los Angeles Times said the film was "a collection of sound bites that validate the filmmaker's point of view. What lifts the film above its dubious boilerplate assemblage of talking heads and archival images is Shadyac himself. With his gentle, self-mocking humor, he comes across as an exceptionally mellow, earnest and likable guy." Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a mixed review, awarding the film two stars out of four and stating that "the film is often absurd and never less than giddy with uplift, but that's not to say it's bad. I watched with an incredulous delight, and at the end, I liked Tom Shadyac quite a lot...he offers us this hopeful if somewhat undigested cut of his findings, in a film as watchable as a really good TV commercial, and just as deep." ==See also== * Materialism (economic) * Materialism (physical) ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2010 films Category:Documentary films about spirituality Category:American LGBT-related documentary films Category:2010s English-language films Category:Films directed by Tom Shadyac Category:2010 documentary films Category:Autobiographical documentary films Category:2010 LGBT-related films Category:Desmond Tutu Category:Noam Chomsky Category:Films with screenplays by Tom Shadyac Category:2010s American films

32070708	I Am a Singer	I Am a Singer () is a popular South Korean singing competition program; a part of MBC's Sunday Night lineup. Seven talented, veteran Korean singers perform for a selected audience, which votes to eliminate one singer after each week's performance. The following week, another singer joins the competition, and the lineup of artists varies throughout the course of the show.Description of Program, MBC, Retrieved on November 15, 2011 The program ended its first season on February 19, 2012. Its second season ended in May 2012. Its third season ended on April 24, 2015. I Am a Singer differs from other televised music competitions in that the participants are all veteran musicians who have established music careers varying from mega stardom to relative obscurity. Due to this fact, and because none of the accomplished singers desire to be voted last amongst their peers and eliminated, the level of performance is usually high and acclaimed by critics and viewers alike. == Composition == The show is divided into rounds. Each round consists of two performance episodes, one that is preliminary and the second final performance which determines the lowest ranking contestant to be eliminated. In between performance are also separate intermediate episodes that document the singers' progress and rehearsals. Contestants are popular and prominent artists from various genres of the Korean music industry. Each contestant is paired with a "manager", seven Korean entertainers and comedians who serve as mentors, accompany their singers throughout the week to provide support during rehearsals and provide comic relief to the show. The competition is documented by the week. At the beginning of the 1st performance week, each contestant selects a song of their choice. All contestants spend the week practicing and planning, given free rein on the interpretation of their songs and the staging of their performances. After the performance, votes from the 500-member studio audience determine the singers' rankings, although there is no elimination. For the 2nd performance week, the singers gather and are assigned predetermined songs that fit their vocal range and style, and the rest of the week is spent in rehearsals and consulting with other musicians. These intermediate episodes include sample performances in the middle of the week, allowing the contestants to exhibit their progress in front of fellow competitors. The competitors privately vote for 1st and 7th place, determining the singers' rankings to serve as a checkpoint. Final performances are given, again, in front of a live audience. At the end of the performances, the audience casts votes for three favorites. The results are revealed sans audience to the contestants and managers, ranking competitors from first to seventh. The competitor with the lowest average ranking is eliminated, and the next week sees a new singer added to the competition. Starting from Round 1, the average of both performance scores is taken and the contestant with the lowest total of votes is eliminated, as new contestant replace him/her. Singers who survive 7 times in a row graduate from the program. == Competition Results == *P = Pass, E = Eliminated, G = Graduated, L = Voluntarily Left, R = Re-challenge Singer Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Results and Airdate Number of Times Passed Singer 3/20 (R1) 3/27 (R2) 5/22 (1R) 6/12 (2R) 7/3 (3R) 7/24 (4R) 8/14 (5R) 9/11 (6R) 10/2 (7R) 10/23 (8R) 11/20 (9R) 12/11 (10R) 1/01 (11R) 1/22 (12R) 2/12 (13R) Number of Times Passed Park Jung-hyun P P P P P P G 7 Kim Bum-soo P P P P P P G 7 Yoon Do-hyun P P P P P P E 6 Lee So-ra P P P E 3 Baek Ji-young P L 2 Kim Gun-mo R L 1 Jung Yeob P E 1 YIm Jae-bum L 1 Kim Yeon-woo E 0 BMK P P E 2 Ock Joo-hyun P P E 2 JK Kim Dong-wook L 1 Jang Hye-jin P P P P P P E 6 Jo Kwan-woo P P P P E 4 Kim Jo-han P P E 2 Jaurim P P P P P P G 7 Bobby Kim P P P P P E 5 Yoon Min-soo P P P P P P G 7 Insooni P P P P E 4 Kim Kyung-ho P P P P P P G 7 Jo Kyu-chan E 0 Gummy P P P P P 4 Juckwoo P P P P 4 Park Wan-kyu P P P 3 Tei E 0 Lee Young-hyun P 1 Lee Hyun-woo P 1 == List of episodes in Season 1 == === Episodes 1-3: Pilot === Episode 1 - 1st Performance *Broadcast: March 6, 2011 Order of Performance Singer Song Title Comedian Manager Ranking 1 Lee So-ra 바람이 분다(The Wind is Blowing) Lee Byung-jin 6 2 Jeong Yeob Nothing Better Kim Shin-young 7 3 Baek Ji-young 총 맞은 것 처럼(Like Being Shot by a bullet) Park Hwi-soon 5 4 Kim Bum-soo 보고 싶다(I Miss You) Park Myung-su 2 5 Yoon Do-hyun 빨간 숲 속(It Burns) Kim Je-dong 4 6 Park Jung-hyun 꿈에(In Dream) Kim Tae-hyun 1 7 Kim Gun-mo 잠 못 드는 밤 비는 내리고(Sleepless Rainy Night) Ji Sang-ryul 3 Episode 2 - Interim Check *Broadcast: March 13, 2011 Interim Ranking Singer Song Title Comedian Manager 1 Jung Yeob 짝사랑 (Ju Hyun-mi) Kim Shin-young 2 Baek Ji-young 무시로 (Na Hoon-ah) Park Hwi-soon 3 Kim Bum-soo 그대 모습은 장미 (Min Hye-kyung) Park Myung-su 4 Park Jung-hyun 비오는 날의 수채화 (Kim Hyun-shik, Kang In-won, Kwon In-ha) Kim Tae-hyun 5 Lee So-ra 너에게로 또다시 (Byun Jin-seob) Lee Byung-jin 6 Yoon Do-hyun 나 항상 그대를 (Lee Sun-hee) Kim Je-dong 7 Kim Gun-mo 립스틱 짙게 바르고 (Im Ju-ri) Ji Sang- ryul Episode 3 - 2nd Performance *Broadcast: March 20, 2011 Order of Performance Singer Song Title Original Singer Comedian Manager Ranking 1 Yoon Do-hyun 나 항상 그대를(I Always Miss You) Lee Sun-hee Kim Je-dong 1(23%) 2 Baek Ji- young 무시로(At Any Time) Na Hoon-ah Park Hwi-soon Private 3 Park Jung-hyun 비오는 날의 수채화(Watercolor of a Rainy day) Kim Hyun-shik, Kang In-won, Kwon In-ha Kim Tae-hyun Private 4 Kim Bum-soo 그대 모습은 장미(Roses Likes You) Min Hye-kyung Park Myung-su Private 5 Kim Gun-mo 립스틱 짙게 바르고(Wearing Lipstick Heavily) Im Ju-ri Ji Sang-ryul 7 6 Lee So-ra 너에게로 또다시(To You Again) Byun Jin-sub Lee Byung-jin Private 7 Jung Yeob 짝사랑(unrequited love) Ju Hyun-mi Kim Shin-young private *Eliminated: Kim Gun-mo === Episode 4: Controversy === *Broadcast: March 27, 2011 Kim Gun-mo was eliminated on Episode 3, but the singers all felt that it was too early to be eliminated so he was brought back to try again.

Its Sanjanas performance as a sex worker that adds drama to the story. Anoop Seelin's foot-tapping tunes will impress the youth. Ashok Kashyap's cinematography is commendable". Shruti Indira Lakshminarayana from Rediff.com scored the film at 2.5 out of 5 stars and says "Gurprasad's dialogues -- romantic, philosophical and comic -- will draw whistles. Anup Silin's songs are a definite advantage. Ashok Kashyap handle's the camera well. If you are a Prem fan and are bored of the run of the mill romantic stories, go find out for yourself". A critic from The New Indian Express wrote "His dialogues are meaningful. Cinematographer Ashok Kashyap has done a neat job behind the camera. Anup Seelin has composed foot-tapping tunes. Songs are good, especially the song —‘Joojuba Joojuba’ — is hummable. The movie is worth watching for all, especially husbands who suspect their sincere and loving wives". B S Srivani from Deccan Herald wrote "Camerawork too measures up to expectations. But for a climax that drags and cheap gimmicks prior to the release, Matthe Banni Prithsona is quite an interesting offering". A critic from News18 India wrote "Anoop Sileen has given different tunes for all the five songs of the film. Ashok Kashyap is as usual exceptional behind the camera. 'I'm Sorry Mathe Banni Preethsona' is a must watch". ===Awards=== * Karnataka State Film Award for Best Screenplay - Ravindra H.

32278040	I Can't Live Without You in This Town	"I Can't Live Without You In This Town" is a song by Portuguese recording artist Slimmy from his second studio album, Be Someone Else (2010). It was written by Slimmy (later produced by Quico Serrano and Mark Turner when Slimmy started working on the album with them by the third quarter of 2009, when "I Can't Live Without You In This Town" was recorded), while Slimmy was on road for "Sex and Love Tour". "I Can't Live Without You In This Town" was inspired by a girl Slimmy met in Texas in 2004. The song was featured on the eighth season of the Portuguese TV series Morangos com Açúcar in 2011. "I Can't Live Without You In This Town" is an electronic rock ballad, influenced by soft rock music. "I Can't Live Without You In This Town" also features electronic beats and a soft-rock influenced breakdown. The lyrics are about Slimmy's deep love with a girl that Slimmy can't live without with.

32300431	I Could Read the Sky	I Could Read the Sky is a 1999 Irish film directed by Nichola Bruce. It is based upon a photographic novel by Timothy O'Grady and Steve Pyke, which concerns the Irish experience of emigration and exile. It has been described as an "innovative, melancholic, and deeply moving film". ==Plot== The film concerns an old Irish immigrant living in London who is looking back over his life. He recalls his early life in the west of Ireland, his first love, emigrating to England, searching for his brother Joe, who disappeared after he emigrated several years previously. His marriage and his wife's later death are also remembered. ==Cast== *Dermot Healy as the old man *Maria Doyle Kennedy as Maggie *Stephen Rea as PJ Doran *Brendan Coyle as Francie *Liam O'Maonlai as Joe Also *Pádraic Breathnach *Mick Lally ==Production== The film was based on a photographic novel of the same name by Timothy O'Grady and Steve Pyke. O'Grady lived for some time in the west of Ireland and was interested in the stories of Irish immigrants. In the author's words: > "I Could Read The Sky is a novel which tells its story through words and > photographs. The story is that of an Irish emigrant struggling to possess > his life in acts of memory. He is old. He is alone. He is lying in bed at > night in the darkness remembering a life of dislocation, of loss, of descent > into madness and of redemption through music and through the love of a > woman. Some of the time he is remembering on prose and some of the time in > pictures. Neither is meant to illustrate the other. They are distinct acts > of memory in their own right. The act of remembering itself becomes a way of > completing his life." The film was directed by Nichola Bruce, and was her first feature film. She had previously made documentaries and experimental films. The film has an unusual appearance, composed almost completely of images of memories, twisted and distorted to various degrees. The music for the film was composed by Irish sean-nós singer and member of Afro Celt Sound System, Iarla Ó Lionáird. Sinéad O'Connor, Noel Hill and Liam O'Maonlai also contributed to the soundtrack. ==References== Category:1999 films Category:English-language Irish films Category:1990s English-language films
32441881	I Am a Camera (film)	I Am a Camera is a 1955 British comedy-drama film based on the 1945 book The Berlin Stories by Christopher Isherwood and the 1951 eponymous play by John Van Druten. The film is a fictionalized account of Isherwood's time living in Berlin between the World Wars. Directed by Henry Cornelius, from a script by John Collier, I Am a Camera stars Laurence Harvey as Isherwood and Julie Harris recreating her Tony Award-winning performance as Sally Bowles. The film was critically unsuccessful upon its release in both the United Kingdom and the United States, and it was subjected to restrictive ratings. Long overshadowed by Cabaret, the 1966 stage and 1972 film adaptation of the same source material, contemporary critics have noted the historic interest of this earlier presentation. ==Plot== In contemporary London, Christopher Isherwood attends a literary party for the launch of a memoir, the author of which he is surprised to learn is Sally Bowles. This knowledge sparks a reverie, and the film flashes back to Berlin, New Year's Eve 1931. Broke and frustrated with his writing, Christopher plans to spend the night in, but his would-be gigolo friend Fritz insists they go to a night club to see Fritz's new inamorata, Sally Bowles, perform. Fritz hopes to live off Sally's earnings as a film star, but his ardour quickly cools at the sight of her fiancé Pierre, with whom she plans to leave for Paris that night. Instead, Pierre absconds with her money. Chris, taking pity on her, invites her to stay at his boarding house. They arrange for Chris to move to a smaller room, and for Sally to take his old room. Over the course of a long and unproductive winter, in which Chris cannot write, and Sally finds no work, Chris attempts to initiate a sexual relationship with Sally. She rejects him, saying it would spoil their friendship. Their spirits renewed by the Spring, Christopher and Sally splurge on a Champagne cocktail at a café, and Sally quickly orders far more cocktails and caviar than they can afford. They are extricated from the situation by wealthy American socialite Clive Mortimer, who pays their bill and takes them on a tour of Berlin night spots. Thus begins a whirlwind relationship between the three, culminating in a planned trip to Honolulu. The trip never happens, as Clive wires that his plans have changed. Chris and Sally have a terrible fight, resulting in a rift in their friendship, and Sally's planned departure. Feeling as though he has reconnected with real life, the formerly a-political Christopher starts a street altercation with a group of Nazis. Returning home, he discovers that Sally has not left, because she is pregnant. Christopher proposes marriage, but Sally refuses him. Writing up an account of his Nazi altercation, Chris sells his "Portrait of Berlin" to an American magazine to raise money for Sally to have an abortion. The magazine editor hires Chris to write a series of portraits of European cities, expecting him to leave the following day. When he returns home, Sally has changed her mind; she plans to keep the baby and marry Chris. The next morning, Sally tells Chris that she has miscalculated the dates, and was never actually pregnant. She is also leaving Berlin for Paris, in pursuit of a film executive with whom Clive has connected her. Back in present-day London, Christopher and Sally re-unite. Upon learning that Sally is again penniless and homeless, Chris invites her to stay in his spare room. In a subplot, Fritz tries to secure the affections of Natalia Landauer, a wealthy Jewish department store heiress and Christopher's student of English. When Natalia fails to respond to his charms, Sally suggests that he "pounce", i.e., make a sexual advance. He reports that this tactic is unsuccessful, and Natalia refuses to see him. Fritz confesses to Christopher that he is Jewish and has been concealing it for years, but vows to stop lying about his heritage. Their story concludes with Fritz and Natalia's announcement to Chris and Sally that they plan to marry and emigrate to Switzerland. ==Cast== * Julie Harris as Sally Bowles * Laurence Harvey as Christopher Isherwood * Shelley Winters as Natalia Landauer * Ron Randell as Clive Mortimer * Lea Seidl as Fräulein Schneider * Anton Diffring as Fritz Wendel * Ina De La Haye as Herr Landauer * Jean Gargoet as Pierre * Stanley Maxted as Curtis B. Ryland, Editor * Alexis Bobrinskoy as Proprietor, Troika * André Mikhelson as Head Waiter, Troika * Frederick Valk as Doctor * Tutte Lemkow as Electro-Therapist * Patrick McGoohan as Swedish Water Therapist * Julia Arnall as Model ==Production== After the play had a successful West End run in 1954, film producers John and James Woolf began exploring the idea of adapting Van Druten's play for the screen. In April 1954, director Henry Cornelius and the Woolfs sent a copy of the play to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) for evaluation. The Board's preliminary report found numerous problems with the play which, if unchanged, would inevitably lead to an X certificate (no one under 16 admitted). The Board's initial report offered suggestions for how the play could be adapted to secure an A certificate (suitable for children if accompanied by an adult), including shifting the play's focus away from Sally Bowles, but recognized that such changes were unlikely because of how markedly they would depart from the original play.Aldgate and Robertson, pp. 66–67 Director Henry Cornelius asked Isherwood to write the screenplay. He was forced to decline, as he was engaged working on the screenplay for Diane, a biopic of Diane de Poitiers, for Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer in Hollywood.Fryer, pp. 250–251 The first draft of John Collier's screenplay was submitted to the BBFC in October 1954. While the screenplay was being prepared, the Board sent four different examiners to see the play. Each agreed that the play as written was unsuitable for filming, although one held out hope that modifications could be made to allow for the A rating.Aldgate and Robertson, pp. 70–73 The BBFC demanded changes to the script, including insisting that Sally Bowles be left poor and unsuccessful at film's end because of her sexual promiscuity in the Berlin flashbacks.Harper and Porter, p. 171 Negotiations between film-makers and the Board continued through November. Finally, on 29 November, a resolution was reached which left film- makers prepared for the likelihood that the film would be certified X regardless.Aldgate and Robertson, p. 73 Filming commenced in mid-October 1954. Cornelius had wanted to film in Berlin, but was unable to because of currency issues with the studio. Isherwood had hoped to be in London for the filming, but his lover Don Bachardy was unable to secure the permission of his local draft board to obtain a passport.Isherwood, p. 465 Ron Randell was cast on the strength of his stage and TV reputation. ==Ratings and certification== The BBFC reviewed I Am a Camera on 9 May 1955, and objected to a single line of dialogue ("Surely he hasn't got a crush on shoes at his age?") that carried an implication of foot fetishism. With that line replaced, the film received an X certificate.Slide, p. 80 In 1961, Associated-Rediffusion asked the BBFC to review the film, hoping to secure an A certificate so as to broadcast the film on television. While acknowledging that the subject matter was mild in light of subsequent films like Room at the Top, Look Back in Anger, and Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, the BBFC found that the abortion subject matter prevented re-certification without re-editing.Aldgate and Robertson, pp. 75–76 Upon its American release, I Am a Camera was denied the Production Code Administration seal of approval. Joseph Breen of the PCA had reviewed a copy of the Van Druten play as early as May 1953, and deemed it to have multiple Code violations. His recommendations were sent to John Van Druten, who disregarded them. The PCA's Geoffrey M. Shurlock, in denying PCA approval to the finished film, cited "gross sexual promiscuity on the part of the leading lady without the proper compensating moral values required by the Code".Shurlock, quoted in Slide, p. 80 This included the film's treatment of the subject of abortion. Many cinemas would not run the film without the seal. Fred J. Schwartz, head of American distributor Distributors Corporation of America, tried to schedule a hearing with the Motion Picture Association of America in August 1955, hoping to overturn the PCA decision and obtain the seal. Schwartz hired civil liberties lawyer Morris Ernst, and scheduled a screening at the Museum of Modern Art in November, hoping to turn the film into a test case against the Production Code. However, the film did not rally the critical support it would have needed to defy the code in the way that the 1953 film The Moon Is Blue had. In February 1956, Schwartz wrote to Shurlock offering to include an additional scene in which Harvey as Isherwood condemned Sally's promiscuity, but would not address the subject of abortion. The Production Code section on abortion was revised in December 1956, and Schwartz once again appealed to Shurlock. Shurlock responded later that month, re- affirming the denial on the basis of the light treatment of the subject matter. Following this denial, Schwartz dropped his pursuit of the seal.Slide, pp. 80–82 On 25 August 1955, the National Legion of Decency condemned I Am a Camera, and at least one cinema pulled the film in response to attacks on the film by Catholic priests.Slide, pp. 80–81 ==Box Office== The film was one of the most popular at the 1955 British box office. According to Kinematograph Weekly it was a "money maker" at the British box office in 1955. ==Reception== British critics were nearly uniform in their disappointment with I Am a Camera, with negative reviews appearing in the Evening News, the Daily Telegraph, the Financial Times, the Daily Mirror, the News Chronicle, and Tribune. Each believed that Laurence Harvey had been miscast as Isherwood. For the most part, they agreed that Harris's performance was a bright spot, although the Daily Sketch expressed a preference for Dorothy Tutin,Aldgate and Robertson, p. 75 who had played Sally on stage in 1954. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times gave I Am a Camera a bad review, finding it "meretricious, insensitive, superficial, and just plain cheap". Crowther was particularly appalled by John Collier's script, blasting it for largely abandoning both the Van Druten and Isherwood source material. He also sharply criticized the abortion material, deeming it a "capstone of cheap contrivance and tasteless indelicacy". Julie Harris he labeled a "show-off", while Laurence Harvey is "an anxious straight man for her jokes", with all parties directed by Cornelius with no eye to any subtlety of character. In an August 1955 pictorial, LIFE magazine called the film's party sequence "violently funny". LIFE praised Harris's acting, while at the same time finding the film spends too much time on Harris's character. Still, LIFE felt confident in predicting the film's success. Julie Harris was nominated for a 1956 BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress.Mayer, p. 201 Isherwood recorded his distaste for the film in his diary, noting his attendance at a 22 June 1955 preview. He found the film "a truly shocking and disgraceful mess. I must admit that John Collier is largely to blame – for a sloppy, confused script. But everything is awful - except for Julie, who was misdirected."Isherwood, p. 509 In a letter to friend John Lehmann, Isherwood called the film "disgusting ooh-la-la, near pornographic trash – a shameful exhibition".Lehmann, p. 92 On the occasion of its video release in 1985, Lawrence Van Gelder, for The New York Times, found that this film, while suffering in comparison with the more lavish Cabaret, is still charming in its way, mostly because of Harris's performance as Sally.NEW CASSETTES: FROM 'COPPERFIELD' TO TOSCANINI Phil Hall reviewed I Am a Camera for Film Threat in 2005. He questioned the casting of Harvey as Isherwood, saying that the role called for a light comedic touch that was never Harvey's forte. Harvey's underplaying of the part, he wrote, clashes with Harris's unrestrained stage-style performance of hers. Still, he found that the film is "an intriguing curio" that garners interest for its exploration of the anti- Semitism that gave rise to the Nazis, and for its handling of "touchier aspects" of the original sources, including Isherwood's homosexualityIsherwood lived as more or less openly gay in Berlin, but concealed his homosexuality in the source material; the film would state only that the character Isherwood was a "confirmed bachelor". and Sally's abortion, which became a false pregnancy scare for the film.THE BOOTLEG FILES: "I AM A CAMERA" ==Notes== ==References== * Aldgate, Anthony and James Chrighton Robertson (2005).

32833402	I Can't Hold Out	"I Can't Hold Out", also known as "Talk to Me Baby", is a blues song written by Willie Dixon and recorded by Elmore James in 1960 for the Chess label. Called a classic and a "popular James standard", it has been interpreted and recorded by several artists. ==Composition and recording== Blues arranger/songwriter Willie Dixon wrote "Talk to Me Baby (I Can't Hold Out)" in late 1958 or 1959 in Los Angeles while he was on tour with Memphis Slim. According to Dixon, he was inspired to write the song after a telephone conversation with his wife Marie. When Dixon returned to Chicago, Elmore James had a recording session for Chess Records and invited Dixon to participate. Together, they "made that 'Talk to Me Baby (I Can't Hold Out Too Long)'", although Dixon does not perform on the song and James is given the composer credit on the label. For the recording session, James, who sang and played slide guitar, was accompanied by his long-time backing band the Broomdusters: J. T. Brown on saxophone, Johnny Jones on piano, Odie Payne on drums, and Homesick James on guitar. ==Releases== "I Can't Hold Out" has been described as a "jumping 'Dust My Broom' styled number ... that featured Dixon's trademark stop-time arrangement after each verse". After recording the song in April 1960, Chess prepared for a rush release of the single in May 1960, to capitalize on the success of James' previous single for Fire Records, "The Sky Is Crying", which was then entering the Billboard R&B; chart. Elmore James was listed as the songwriter on the single and in an early BMI registration. In February 1963 during his last recording session, Elmore James re-recorded the song during a "thrown together session" with New York session musicians for the Fire/Fury/Enjoy record labels. When this version of the song was later released on various budget compilation albums (it was not released as a single), it was titled "Talk to Me Baby". When the original song was included on the 1969 Chess compilation album Whose Muddy Shoes, it was re-titled "Talk to Me Baby" and credited to Willie Dixon. Subsequent appearances of the song are often titled "Talk to Me Baby". ==References== Category:1960 singles Category:Elmore James songs Category:Songs written by Willie Dixon Category:Eric Clapton songs Category:1960 songs Category:Chess Records singles Category:Blues songs
32895990	I Cavalry Corps (Grande Armée)	The I Cavalry Corps of the Grande Armée was a French military unit that existed during the Napoleonic Wars. == History == For one month in 1806-1807, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte split his Reserve Cavalry Corps into the I and II Cavalry Corps. At that time, Marshal Joachim Murat took command of the short- lived I Cavalry Corps before resuming leadership over Napoleon's Reserve Cavalry when the experiment ended. The I Cavalry Corps was not recreated until 1812 for the invasion of Russia when command was exercised by General Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty. The corps fought at Borodino and Tarutino. After being destroyed during the retreat from Russia, the I Cavalry Corps was reconstituted in 1813 and General Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg was appointed to lead it. The corps fought at Lützen, Bautzen, Dresden, and Leipzig. At Leipzig, the corp took part in Murat's great charge, Latour- Maubourg was seriously wounded at the battle and replaced by General Jean- Pierre Doumerc who led the corps for the remainder of the War of the Sixth Coalition which ended with Napoleon's abdication in 1814. ==References== GAC01
33065839	I Am Unicorn	"I Am Unicorn" is the second episode of the third season of the American musical television series Glee, and the forty-sixth overall. The episode was written by series co-creator Ryan Murphy, directed by series co-creator Brad Falchuk, and first aired on September 27, 2011 on Fox in the United States. It features the return of Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel) to the show to direct a rival glee club at William McKinley High even while New Directions, the current club, is having trouble recruiting members. Shelby also wants Quinn (Dianna Agron) and Puck (Mark Salling), the biological parents of her adopted daughter Beth, to be a part of Beth's life. The director of New Directions, Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) sets up a "booty camp" for the less capable dancers in the club, and auditions for the school musical, West Side Story, begin. The episode received mostly positive reviews, with approval being given to the resurrection of neglected storylines from the show's first season. One of these was the adoption of Beth, and critics were especially happy with the scene where Puck meets her, but there was widespread disdain for the explanation behind Shelby's return, that of starting a rival glee club. There were only three musical numbers in the episode, though all three were given positive notices, with the overall favorite being Blaine's performance of "Something's Coming" from West Side Story at the end of the episode. All three songs were released as singles, available for download, and "Somewhere", sung as a duet by Menzel and Lea Michele, charted on the Billboard Hot 100. It did not chart on the Canadian Hot 100. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 8.60 million American viewers and garnered a 3.7/10 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic. The total viewership and ratings for this episode were down from the previous week's season opener, "The Purple Piano Project". ==Plot== Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) institutes a "booty camp" to hone the dancing skills of New Directions members Finn (Cory Monteith), Mercedes (Amber Riley), Puck (Mark Salling), Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Blaine (Darren Criss), and has Mike (Harry Shum Jr.) instruct them. As he is too busy to direct the upcoming school musical West Side Story, guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) and New Directions member Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) take charge of it. Rachel (Lea Michele) and Kurt audition, respectively, for the lead roles of Maria and Tony; she performs "Somewhere" from the show, and he performs "I'm the Greatest Star" from Funny Girl. Kurt later eavesdrops on the directors and hears them question whether he is masculine enough for the role. He re-auditions and attempts to give a more masculine performance, but they are unable to suppress laughter at his acting. Kurt is also running for class president, and accepts campaign help from Brittany (Heather Morris), who wants to highlight his unique character by comparing him to a unicorn. Kurt feels her proposed campaign materials highlight only his gay side, and is upset when she goes against his wishes and posts them anyway. He discusses his image problem with his father, Burt (Mike O'Malley), who recommends that he embrace his uniqueness. Kurt later changes his mind about his campaign's approach and apologizes to Brittany, but is surprised to learn that she too has decided to run for class president. Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel)—Rachel's biological mother, the adoptive mother of Quinn (Dianna Agron) and Puck's daughter Beth, and the former coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline—is headhunted to coach a second glee club at McKinley High financed by Sugar Motta's (Vanessa Lengies) wealthy and doting father. Shelby reaches out to Rachel, Puck and Quinn. She lets Puck see Beth, but rejects Quinn's desire to do likewise due to Quinn's bad-girl attitude, appearance and behavior. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), who is running for Congress, convinces Quinn to feature in an anti-arts video for her campaign. In it, Quinn confronts Will and blames him for her transformation into a bad girl, but Will reprimands her, reminds her of how the glee club and its members have always supported her in the past and tells her to grow up. After seeing a picture of a happy Beth and Puck, Quinn breaks down. She resumes her normal appearance, and Will and the New Directions welcome her back into the club. Puck tells Quinn he is proud of her, but Quinn reveals she is only pretending to behave in order to take Beth back from Shelby, and intends to pursue full custody. To avoid competing with Kurt, Blaine auditions for a supporting role with a rendition of "Something's Coming", one of Tony's songs from the show. The directors are impressed, and ask if he will read for the part of Tony instead. Kurt, who was watching from above, silently walks out of the auditorium. ==Production== The episode was written by series co-creator Ryan Murphy, directed by series co- creator Brad Falchuk, and was filmed in five days, from August 22, 2011 through August 26, 2011. Broadway star Idina Menzel returns for the first time since the first season finale "Journey to Regionals", when her character, Shelby Corcoran, adopted Quinn's newborn baby, named Beth. On July 15, 2011, it was announced that Menzel would be returning to Glee in the third season "for a major arc that could span as many as 10-12 episodes". Series co-creator Ryan Murphy was quoted as saying, "I'm really excited [...] that Idina is joining the family again. We missed her last year and we're happy that she is coming back." The article also noted that her character, Shelby, would be "returning from New York to Ohio to join William McKinley High School as a new teacher". Menzel herself said that she would "be back and forth in Glee all throughout the season", which she was "very excited about". Shelby's adopted daughter is also appearing: Menzel tweeted that she was "shooting scenes with babies". The drawing of the "Clown Pig" that Puck brings for Beth was actually drawn by Falchuk and Agron. Recurring guest stars appearing in the episode include Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), Coach Beiste (Jones), cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), student Sugar Motta (Lengies) and Menzel as Shelby. Second season series regular Mike O'Malley, who plays Burt Hummel and also appears in the episode, is listed in the Fox press release as a guest star for this episode and receives a like credit in the episode itself. Three singles were released from the episode: "I'm the Greatest Star" from Funny Girl sung by Colfer, and covers of "Something's Coming" and "Somewhere" from West Side Story—the former sung by Criss, and the latter a duet between Michele and Menzel. ==Reception== ===Ratings=== "I Am Unicorn" was first broadcast on September 27, 2011 in the United States on Fox. It garnered a 3.7/10 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic, and received 8.60 million American viewers during its initial airing. It was beaten for the second week in a row in its timeslot by NCIS on CBS, which earned a 4.2/12 rating/share in the 18–49 demographic, and also by the second episode of New Girl, which follows Glee on Fox, and brought in a 4.5/11 rating/share and 9.28 million viewers. The Glee numbers were down from the previous week's season opener, "The Purple Piano Project", which netted a 4.0/11 rating/share and 9.21 million viewers. In the United Kingdom, "I Am Unicorn" was watched on Sky1 by 995,000 viewers, down 177,000 from the season premiere the previous week.UK viewership data: *"I Am Unicorn": *"The Purple Piano Project": In Australia, the episode drew 729,000 viewers, which made Glee the fifteenth most-watched program of the night, down from the season premiere's twelfth most-watched program of the night and 760,000 viewers in the previous week.Australian viewership data: *"I Am Unicorn": *Season premiere ("The Purple Piano Project"): In Canada, 1.50 million viewers watched the episode, and it was the eighteenth most-viewed show of the week, down eight slots and 28% from the 2.10 million who watched "The Purple Piano Project". ===Critical reception=== Reviewers generally received this episode positively, though some, like IGN Robert Canning, thought it was merely "okay"; he gave it a score of 6.5 out of 10, and Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times said she "felt vaguely underwhelmed" and that the episode "lacked emotional resonance". In contrast, The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff gave the episode a "B", and called it "a marked improvement over the season premiere", and complimented the way it "gave nearly all of the storylines an emotional core". Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times characterized it as "one of the tightest, best-made, most well-acted, and entertaining hours" from Glee in a very long time, and BuddyTV John Kubicek said that it was "quintessential Glee" and that "the show is once again a magical, fabulous unicorn." Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle was "charmed", "moved", and "excited for what's to come." The reappearance of storylines left dangling at the end of the first season was noted with approval by Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News and VanDerWerff, who both mentioned not only the big one about Quinn and Puck and baby Beth but also Artie's love of directing, and variously added Rachel and Shelby, and movement on the Will and Emma relationship. The fact that Shelby had been hired to form a second glee club at McKinley, however, was greeted with derision by both reviewers—Urban called it "mind-bogglingly idiotic"—and others as well. Reiter found the idea incomprehensible, and Vanity Fair Brett Berk wrote, "Given Will's ongoing struggles to fill his own crooning baker's dozen, this is about as realistic a plan as Michele Bachmann starting a rival chapter of PFLAG at Liberty University." Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger characterized the notion of "Shelby deciding to give up a burgeoning Broadway career because she was missing her daughter grow up" to take a part-time job in Lima as "ridiculous", and the whole scenario as "more than a little bizarre". The effect of Shelby's advent on Puck evoked the most praise. Benigno called the segment where Puck meets Beth "the best scene of this very young season", The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg said it was a "top moment", and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly dubbed it "the sweetest scene of the night". VanDerWerff also called it "very sweet" and expressed hope that "the show will come up with something for him to do after mostly relegating him to weird comic relief last season." The effect of her return on Quinn was greeted with less enthusiasm. Reiter was "not thrilled" by the possibility of a custody battle between Quinn and Shelby and called Quinn's plan "half- baked", and Canning dismissed it as "clichéd drama". Kubicek expressed interest in seeing "where this goes", and VanDerWerff noted that Quinn has been "grieving giving up her child all this time and she didn't even know it", and characterized it as a "fairly powerful storyline". Critics were divided on Kurt's storyline as he faced being perceived primarily as gay both when auditioning and when running for class president. VanDerWerff said it was "the most consistent" storyline, and Canning called it "the most familiar story", but also described Kurt as "by far the most interesting and most layered" character, his stories "delivering the most emotional connections", and this episode's installments "entertaining territory". Kubicek stated that there were "tons" of wonderful "Kurt moments" in the episode. Benigno called Kurt learning to embrace his gayness yet again on the show "kind of awkward", and Hyman asked "Was this Kurt Accepts He's Special 3.0 or 4.0? I can't keep track." Votta summed up Kurt's audition quandary: "Kurt is fighting typecasting, and while the ninjitsu, fingerless gloves and climbing routine might have been an attempt to butch it up, instead Kurt played right into expectations with the over-the-top Funny Girl piece." His attempt to rescue the situation by reauditioning via performing a Romeo and Juliet scene with Rachel evoked laughter from the three directors and Rachel herself, but as Votta points out, Kurt was "not actually being bad as Romeo". Jayma Mays, who plays Emma, one of the directors in that scene, stated in an interview that she thought Kurt was "good". Kurt finding himself in competition with Blaine was also touched on, but several reviewers were unhappy with the revelation that Blaine was not a senior like Kurt, as had been implied in the previous season. VanDerWerff wrote that Blaine "seems to have simultaneously gotten younger and had a complete personality transplant over the summer", Votta noted "the continuity-bending plot point that he's somehow a Junior and not a Senior like his boyfriend", and Urban allowed her exasperation to show: "Oh really, Glee? Blaine's a junior? Blaine's younger than Kurt? Fine. FINE." MTV Jim Cantiello went into rhyme to express his dismay: "It's hard to keep my bearings straight / And oh, how it makes my heart ache / Kurt and Blaine were gonna move to New York together / But now they'll have to wait", referring to a scene in the "New York" episode where Kurt discussed the planned move with Rachel. Goldberg was pleased that having Brittany volunteer to run Kurt's campaign included an acknowledgment that he "went through hell" the previous year, and praised "Brittany logic" in general. Respers France loved that Brittany, in helping Kurt find his magical inner unicorn, was able to find her own. Reiter enjoyed the "delicious dose of Brittany-isms", which she called "the best part" of the episode, and Kubicek said that there were "tons of wonderful" Brittany moments. For Hyman, the "one sit-up-and-take-notice moment" was the confrontation between Will and Quinn where he told her to grow up. Respers France thought "Sue Sylvester's attempt to use Quinn against the glee club was hilarious", but VanDerWerff was unhappy with Quinn being coopted into "Sue’s ridiculous run for Congress". Reiter wrote that it was "hard to muster much sympathy for Quinn" in the episode given the scene with Quinn and The Skanks: "Flushing someone's head in a public toilet, threatening to cut them, and shaking them down for their lunch money are orders of magnitude more chilling than the face-full-of-slushy bullying we're used to seeing." ===Music and performances=== The episode's musical performances were well received by most reviewers. All three were Broadway songs, two from West Side Story and one from Funny Girl—the concentration on show tunes disappointed Reiter, and Canning felt they were all "too bland", but others were happy with the selections including Hankinson who said he was "loving the Broadway-bend to these first two episodes", and added, "all three of tonight's numbers were hands-down fantastic." The duet of "Somewhere" featuring Rachel and Shelby was generally complimented. Both Benigno and Rae Votta of Billboard compared it favorably to their previous duet, Lady Gaga's "Poker Face", from season one. Benigno gave the performance a "B+", while Michael Slezak of TVLine gave it an "A−" and praised their "powerful, evocative voices". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman was not impressed, and characterized it as "Lite FM snooze that does nothing to showcase these Broadway belters in a new and exciting way". Amy Lee of The Huffington Post called it "pretty bland", and said it was "getting annoying" that Rachel "sings every song as if she's Barbra Streisand". The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez, however, called the duet "pitch-perfect" and "so sublime it makes you catch your breath". Kurt's choice of "I'm the Greatest Star" to audition for the role of Tony—the one song not from West Side Story—drew comment: Benigno ascribed it to Kurt's "ability to make a talented ass of himself", while Slezak was of the opinion that Kurt was "way too savvy, and way too hungry for the role" for that kind of misstep. Despite these plot-related issues, both reviewers gave the performance an "A", and Benigno noted both that "he nails it" and "last half of the song is a singing clinic." VanDerWerff was not fond of the reliance on "gimmicky staging", though Futterman called it "an impressive physical performance", Votta stated that "Kurt sounds flawless and the performance is captivating" and Flandez complimented his "captivating high notes after high notes", and added, "He's a star unicorn, and he knows it." Lisa Respers France of CNN wrote that Kurt "was amazing singing Streisand, and for the first time I realized that he really is as big a star as Rachel." Blaine's rendition of "Something's Coming" was the most enthusiastically welcomed. It was the favorite number of Lee, VanDerWerff and Futterman; Lee said it was "the best song", and added, "he's kinetic, impassioned and generally delightful as Blaine-playing-Tony." VanDerWerff was even more complimentary with "by far the best performance", and Futterman called it "the winning musical number of the episode". Both Slezak and Benigno gave it a "B+", and the former complimented Criss's "breathless charm and boyish enthusiasm", while the latter maintained that the actor is "at his best when he's doing goofy pop numbers with kind of an off- beat twist". West gave the song an "A−", and said "Blaine just knows how to own the stage and your TV screen", while both Votta and Respers France wrote that he was the "perfect Tony". ===Chart history=== One of the three cover versions released as singles debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, and none charted on the Canadian Hot 100 or in England or Australia. The duet version of "Somewhere" appeared at number seventy-five, the fourth time the song charted in the Hot 100. By contrast, "Something's Coming", the episode's other song from West Side Story, has never appeared in the Hot 100, and failed to chart there again. ==References== ==External links== * "I Am Unicorn" at Fox.com * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Glee (season 3) episodes Category:Television episodes written by Ryan Murphy (filmmaker) Category:American LGBT-related television episodes
3313905	I Can Drive	"I Can Drive" is a song by UK pop act Shakespears Sister, released in June 1996 as the lead single from their third studio album #3. The song was co- written and produced by Fahey's then-husband David A. Stewart and featured the now prominent record producer/writer Jimmy Hogarth on guitar.#3 album liner notes == Background == "I Can Drive" peaked at #30 on the UK Singles Chart, and was not released internationally. Although intended as the lead single from the band's third album, London Records then opted not to release the album at all and Shakespears Sister were dropped by the company, making this their last release with the label. Siobhan Fahey, the act's only full member by that time, eventually obtained the rights to release the album herself (via her website) in 2005. She later claimed that she was dropped by the label not because of the mediocre chart performance of "I Can Drive", but due to the label thinking the album was "too alternative for a woman of my age". == Critical reception == British magazine Music Week rated "I Can Drive" five out of five, picking it as Single of the Week. The reviewer wrote, "Strings and harpsichord give this return single from Siobhan Fahey an olde world feel. Fahey has her fans, and they'll welcome this unusual offering." == Track listing == *;CD single #"I Can Drive" — 4:09 #"Oh No, It's Michael" — 5:10 #"Suddenly" — 3:42 *;7" / Cassette #"I Can Drive" — 4:09 #"Oh No, It's Michael" — 5:10 *; 12" Promo #"I Can Drive (Pull Down Your Pants Mix)" — 6:32 #"I Can Drive (Pull Down Your Pants Dub)" — 6:06 #"I Can Drive (Roger Weed Mix)" — 8.00 == Charts == Chart (1996) Peak position UK Singles (OCC) 30 == References == Category:1996 singles Category:Shakespears Sister songs Category:Music videos directed by Sophie Muller Category:Songs written by David A.

33328450	I Break Horses	I Break Horses are a Swedish indie rock band made up of Maria Lindén and Fredrik Balck. The band took its name from a song of the same name by Bill Callahan. ==History== I Break Horses' debut studio album Hearts was released on 22 August 2011 on Bella Union .

Chiaroscuro, the band's second album, was released 20 January 2014, followed by an intimate gig at the Village Underground in Shoreditch, London, UK, to a sell out crowd, ahead of their Stateside tour that spring. Their third album, Warnings, released in 2020 was described as Woozy Synthscapes by Phil Mongredien in the Observer. ==Critical reception== The Guardian music critic Hermione Hoby described their music as "heady, sumptuously textured soundscapes", while Pitchfork music critic Ian Cohen comments that they "immerse themselves in homemade shoegaze, the kind that's made by computers for computers. It's an approach and sound that's crossed language barriers for the past 20 or so years as bands strive to approximate Loveless without the benefit of a label they can bankrupt in the process.". thumb|I Break Horses live at Village Underground Shoreditch London ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Hearts (2011) * Chiaroscuro (2014) * Warnings (2020) ===EPs=== * Remix (2014) ===Singles=== * "Winter Beats" (2011) * "Hearts" (2011) * "Faith" (2013) * "Denial" (2013) * "I'll Be the Death of You" (2020) * "Death Engine" (2020) ===Guest appearances=== * Korallreven - "Mantras" and "Ki" from Second Comin' (2014) * Lushlife + CSLSX - "The Waking World" from Ritualize (2016) ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Swedish indie rock groups Category:Shoegazing musical groups Category:Bella Union artists

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 51, based on 23 reviews. Jody Rosen, writing in Rolling Stone, felt that Wayne is "half- interested" and lacks the "exhilarating surprise" of his previous work. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the album shows Wayne "streamlining his eccentricities", while Pitchforks Jayson Greene panned his lyrics as an "undifferentiated slurry of interchangeable" dick jokes, drug references, and unconvincing puns, "none of them funny or creative". Alex Macpherson of The Guardian found his metaphors "laboured, tired or just remarkably offputting." Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club accused Wayne of having "bad taste" and rapping solely about oral sex, "a subject that tends to invite misplaced aggression and puerile humor". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the album "less manic, less experimental, less unpredictable and, oddly, less consistent" than "drug-era Lil Wayne". Al Horner of NME said that "the chilling growl and imaginative Auto-Tune of hits like 'Got Money' replaced by tired punchlines and lazy hooks." Spins Brandon Soderberg felt that the album was a continuation of "Wayne's steady creative decline", adding that "you're better off soaking in the good choices here and resigning yourself to enduring the bad ones." Dean Van Nguyen of PopMatters found the beats "dispensable" and said that they "mirror his own boredom with the project." Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe said that, apart from the "potent" "Gunwalk" and "No Worries", the album is "both numbingly haphazard and inconsequential." In a positive review, David Jeffries of AllMusic said that the album is an "indulgent jumble of a sideline release, but that doesn't mean Wayne isn't in fine form", and observed "stunning talent, true wit, and a John Holmes level of cocksure" from him. USA Todays Steve Jones found it "solid" and "often entertaining in the crass, lewd and rude way that's uniquely Wayne." MSN Music's Robert Christgau called it "progress" that the songs "deploy the P-word" sexually rather than pejoratively and felt that it suggests that, "unlike most rappers and related pop lifeforms who brag about sex, Weezy really seems to savor it ... A loose-lipped ship-sinker is what he was meant to be." == Commercial performance == I Am Not a Human Being II debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, selling 217,000 copies in the first week. This became Wayne's tenth US top-ten debut. In its second week, the album dropped to number five on the chart, selling an additional 68,000 copies. In its third week, the album dropped to number eight on the chart, selling 42,000 more copies. In its fourth week, the album remained at number eight on the chart, selling 31,000 copies. As of July 30, 2013, the album has sold 529,000 copies in the US. On September 25, 2020, the album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over two million units in the United States. == Track listing == ;Notes * signifies a co-producer. * "Romance" is not included on the digital version or the Japanese version of the album. * "Gunwalk" features uncredited vocals by Juicy J. ;Samples credits * "Days and Days" contains samples from Barbara Lynn's "Good Women." * "Back to You" contains samples from Jamie Lidell's "Compass." * "Hot Revolver" contains samples from Green Day's "Basket Case." * "Trigger Finger" contains samples from Jesper Kyd's "Leonardo's Inventions, Part 1."

He travels to Los Angeles to bring his brother's murderers to justice. There he meets former LAPD officer Fateh Singh and Pakistani American Rizwan Hyder who help him uncover the truth of what really happened. ==Cast== *Gulzar Inder Chahal as Ranveer Singh *Rizwan Haider as Rizwan Hyder *Amy Rasimas as Amy Washington *Puneet Issar as Fateh Singh *Brooke Johnston as Amelia White *Tulip Joshi as Sara Hasan *Mike Singh as Ajit Singh *Yusuf Hussain as Hasan, Sara's father *Neetha Mohindra as Simran Kaur, Ajit's wife *Kavi Raz as Ranjit Singh, Ranveer's father *Donny Kapoor as Veer Singh ==Soundtrack== #"Dukalaang Praanasi" (Daler Mehndi) 6:55 #"I Am Singh" (Daler Mehndi, Hard Kaur and Sukhwinder Singh) 6:45 #"Dhol Wajda" (Mika Singh) 4:30 #"Kya Jeena" (Rahat Fateh Ali Khan) #"Channd Paregge" (Sonu Kakkar, Sukhwinder Singh) 5:55 #"Dil Naiyyo Lagda" (Gayatri Iyer) 5:40 #"Doori Hai" (Rahat Fateh Ali Khan) 1:56 #"Khanda Prithme Saajke" (Arvinder Singh) 3:28 #"Turban Victory" (Kunal Ganjawala, Sukhwinder Singh) 4:09 #"I Am Singh (Video Edit)" (Daler Mehndi) 3:55 ==Reception== Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 1 out of 5 stars stating "The intent is right, but the written material isn't convincing, while the execution of the material is archaic, reminiscent of the cinema of the 80s, where over the top performances were considered 'acting'.""I Am Singh" review Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, stating, "Puneet Issar does make a valiant effort to make a meaningful film about the aftermath of 9/11. Sadly, the effort gets bogged down by the hysterical undertones and the preachy nature of the film which ends up essentially as a documentary on Sikhism.""I Am Singh" review John Anderson of Variety states, "A little late and more than a little goofy, "I Am Singh" splices a very serious subject—post-9/11 hate crimes against turban-wearing Sikhs—onto a Bollywood format, diluting a sobering message with hysterical dance numbers, engorged dialogue, bimbo-esque blondes and over-the-top performances."I am Singh review ==See also== *List of cultural references to the September 11 attacks ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2011 films Category:Films based on the September 11 attacks Category:2010s Hindi-language films Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films scored by Surinder Sodhi Category:Punjabi-language Indian films Category:2010s Punjabi-language films Category:Films about Sikhism

34390769	I Could Stay	I Could Stay is the second single from Canadian/Jamaican singer Kreesha Turner's second studio album, Tropic Electric. The song was written by Kreesha Turner, Erika Nuri and Greg Ogan. The single received Canadian airplay for almost two months before the song was official released onto iTunes. The iTunes single only contains the radio edit of the track, much like Kreesha Turner's previous singles. "I Could Stay" was noted for referencing and sounding similar to Janet Jackson's "Runaway". ==Music video== The music video premiered on Kreesha Turner's official VEVO channel, on November 15, 2011, the same day as the album Tropic Electric was released. The video was shot in Jamaica, as Kreesha wanted to capture the beauty of the country. Elements of the video, such as the scene in which Kreesha swings across water, were shot in the rain, due to a time limit placed on the production of the video. ==Charts== Chart (2011) Peak position Canada (Canadian Hot 100) 59 ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Kreesha Turner songs Category:2011 songs Category:Songs written by Erika Nuri Category:Songs written by Kreesha Turner Category:EMI Records singles
34420393	I Am the King	I Am the King (, also known as I Am a King) is a 2012 South Korean historical comedy film, starring Ju Ji-hoon, Park Yeong-gyu, Baek Yoon-sik, Byun Hee-bong and Kim Su-ro. Inspired by Mark Twain's 1881 novel The Prince and the Pauper, the film is set in the Joseon Dynasty with Ju playing the dual role of a king and a beggar. It was released on August 8, 2012 and ran for 120 minutes. ==Background== The movie depicts the three months before Choong-nyung (the future Sejong the Great) becomes king. The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, which follow the history of the Joseon Dynasty between 1413 and 1865, leave out records of this crucial period. While to future generations King Sejong would stand as a legendary figure for his creation of the Korean alphabet and advancing the country’s scientific research and law, as Prince Choong-nyung he was known to be a bit of a reclusive bookworm. ==Plot== When his older brothers Yangnyeong and Hyoryeong fail to impress their father King Taejong, the king makes a royal command for Choong-nyung to become the next ruler of the kingdom instead. The prince, who strongly refuses to become the king and just wants to live a happy and stress-free life buried in his books, chooses to escape the palace before his coronation ceremony. After hours of contemplation, Choong-nyung escapes by climbing over the palace wall. There he runs into a bad-tempered drunken slave named Deok-chil, who happens to be at the palace to save the love of his life who was captured by government officials and put in prison for being the daughter of a suspected spy. Deok- chil perfectly resembles the prince, so Choong-nyung instantly grabs the chance to disguise himself as a slave and they exchange clothes with each other. In a terrible twist of fate, when Choong-nyung wakes up after being knocked unconscious, he is mistaken for a slave and Deok-chil gets put on the throne. As Choong-nyung ventures outside the palace walls, he begins to open his eyes to the people living in extreme poverty and experiences the life of the common man. ==Cast== *Ju Ji-hoon as Grand Prince Choong-nyung / Duk-Chil *Baek Yoon-sik as Hwang-Hee *Byun Hee-bong as Shin-Ik *Park Yeong-gyu as King Taejong *Im Won-hee as Hae-Koo *Lee Hanee as Soo-Yeon *Kim Su-ro as Hwang-Koo *Baek Do-bin as Grand Prince Yang-nyung *Im Hyung-joon as Jang Young-shil *Kim Eung-soo as an old butcher *Kim So-hyun as Sol-Bi *Han Yeo-wool as a virgin *Lee Mi-do as the Crown Princess Consort *Yoon Kyung-ho as Geun-Bae *Kwon Hyuk-soo as Soo Yeon-boo *Lee Dae-gwang as Tteok seller 1 *Lee Jung-hoon as Tteok seller 2 *Kim Wang-geun as Lee-Bang *Yang Myung-hun as Hwang-Hee's warrior *Jang Tae-min as a Slave *Byun Joo-hyun as a Royal officer *Jung-Woon as Yang-nyung's group *Ham Jin-sung as Yang-nyung's group *Lee Chul-hee *Im Hak-soon ==Special screening== On August 13, 2012, a special screening was held at Deoksu Palace in Seoul, the first Korean movie screened outdoors on the palace grounds.

35181895	I Can't Take It	"I Can't Take It" is a song by the American rock band Cheap Trick, which was released in 1983 as the second single from their seventh studio album Next Position Please. The song was written by Robin Zander and produced by Todd Rundgren. ==Writing== "I Can't Take It" is credited solely to Zander, although Pete Comita, the bassist for Cheap Trick in 1980-81, later claimed that he came up with much of the track. According to Comita, he had the riff, melody and title, while Zander helped with the arrangement and the lyrics. Comita said in an interview in 2008 that the song originated as two separate tracks, "I Can't Take It" and "Move'n On", which he had written before joining the band in 1980. When Zander heard Comita's demos, he expressed interest in working on the tracks. Comita subsequently visited Zander at his home in Rockford and the two songs were combined into one track and finished. Comita left Cheap Trick in 1981 and Zander later revealed to him his intention to record "I Can't Take It" for the band's 1983 album Next Position Please. He requested his former bandmate receive no initial credit as a writer, with Comita revealing to the 12-String Bass Encyclopedia in 2008, "He couldn't tell the band I had anything to do with [the song] or they wouldn't put it on the record because they were pissed that I quit. [Zander] said after it was recorded he would tell them my involvement and we would settle up on the details. After the record was released I asked him if he had told the band the truth about the song. He said, 'What are you talking about, Pete?' I was in complete disbelief. More than anything it hurt my feelings because I thought we were friends." In a 2012 interview with Punk Globe, drummer Bun E. Carlos said, "Pete might have come up with [the] riff. But he didn't write that song, Robin wrote that song. Robin had been working on that song for years!" ==Release and promotion== Although Rundgren had advised Epic to release "I Can't Take It" as the album's lead single, the label were less enthusiastic about the song. They had the band record a version of The Motors' "Dancing the Night Away" and opted to release that as the first single instead. When it failed to chart, the label released "I Can't Take It". The band performed the song on the American late night talk show Thicke of the Night, and it was included as part of their set for the German TV show Rockpalast. In 1984, the band performed the song on the show Rock Rolls On (RRO). ==Music video== The song's music video was directed by Mark Rezyka. It achieved medium rotation on MTV. Rezyka revealed in 2015, "When I was writing that, I just wanted the craziest video ever made. I wanted the most surreal video of all time." ==Critical reception== In a review of Next Position Please, Cash Box stated, "Rundgren offers his nimble fingers to mold Cheap Trick into a viable pop force once again, and just judging from the first number - a sensational bass- driven song called "I Can't Take It" that sounds like an outtake from a vintage Beatles' session - he's succeeded admirably."Cash Box newspaper - 27 August 1983 - Reviews: albums - page 8 Rolling Stone commented, "A better title for this album would have been 'Next Producer Please', because from the signature harmonies of "I Can't Take It" to the predictable chorus of "Heaven's Falling," it's clear that this album belongs as much to producer Todd Rundgren as to the members of Cheap Trick." AllMusic retrospectively wrote, "The bright surfaces with the guitars and keyboards melding so tightly with the vocal harmonies they’re inseparable, produce a sound that is uncannily reminiscent of Oops! Wrong Planet, but Rundgren also helps keep an eye on quality control, letting Robin Zander's terrific "I Can't Take It" open the album". In a review of the 1996 box-set Sex, America, Cheap Trick, Billboard described the song as a "Beatlesque gem". In the 2007 book Shake Some Action: The Ultimate Power Pop Guide, author John M. Borack picked the song as one of twenty stand-out tracks from the band's career. He wrote, "This is pure, unfiltered power pop for the masses, with Todd Rundgren's bright 'n' shiny production, giving it a radio-friendly sheen. One of the great, semi- lost Cheap Trick numbers, and one they still perform live." ==Cover versions== * In 2011, Todd Rundgren released his own version of the song on his 2011 solo album (re)Production. ==Track listing== ;7" single #"I Can't Take It" - 3:26 #"You Talk Too Much" - 1:55 ;7" single (US promo) #"I Can't Take It" - 3:26 #"I Can't Take It" - 3:26 ==Personnel== Cheap Trick * Robin Zander - lead vocals, rhythm guitar * Rick Nielsen - lead guitar, backing vocals * Jon Brant - bass, backing vocals * Bun E.

35494660	I Am Your Leader	"I Am Your Leader" is a song recorded by American rapper and singer Nicki Minaj for her second studio album Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded (2012). The song features additional rap vocals from hip hop artists Rick Ross and Cam'ron. Production of the song was handled by Fernando Garibay & Chauncey "Hit-Boy" Hollis, with writing coming from Minaj, Garibay, Hollis, Ross, and Cam'ron. Musically, "I Am Your Leader" is a midtempo hardcore hip hop and electro hop song that contains sparse beats, minimal instrumentation, repetitive, high- pitched, off-pitch synth hooks, and a booming, static bass. Lyrically, Minaj "dishes boast-heavy verses about how she’s better than all these other bitches", according to Adam Fleischer of XXL Magazine. "I Am Your Leader" garnered praise from contemporary music critics, with the majority praising the song's production, Minaj's vocal delivery, and the appearances of Cam'ron and Ross. To promote the song, an accompanying music video for the song was released on August 24, 2012. It features Minaj inside a brightly colored playhouse dressed in eccentric clothing, while sequences show Minaj, Ross and Cam'ron in different rooms such as the bathroom, the staircase, and the dining room. Fellow rapper Tyga also makes a brief cameo appearance. Despite not being released as a single, "I Am Your Leader" peaked at number 71 on the US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Minaj briefly performed a part of the song on The Today Show's summer concert series. ==Background== Following the success of Minaj's debut album, Pink Friday, Cash Money co-CEO, Brian "Birdman" Williams announced to Billboard that Minaj was aiming to release her second album within the first quarter of 2012. In November 2011, Minaj announced on Twitter that the album would be released on February 14, 2012, though it was later delayed to April 3, 2012. The album focuses on Roman Zolanski, one of Minaj's alter egos that was first featured on Pink Friday. On May 24, 2012, a poll was posted on Minaj's official website asking fans to choose the next single(s). The poll was divided into three categories: The second category asked fans to choose between "Champion", "HOV Lane", and "I Am Your Leader". "Champion" had the most votes and won the poll; "HOV Lane" came in second, and "I Am Your Leader" came in third. On June 6, 2012, Minaj announced through her official Twitter that "Champion" would be the next urban single. ==Composition== "I Am Your Leader" is a hardcore hip-hop and electro-hop song that runs for three minutes and thirty-three seconds. The production consists of a "chilled-out, humming beat punctuated on the chorus with a blunted fake- horn hook—halfway between classic-era Neptunes and Look At Me Now" according to Andrew Unterberger of Popdust. It also contains repetitive, high-pitched, off-pitch synth hooks, and a booming, static bass. "I Am Your Leader" makes use of sparse beats, frills, minimal instrumentation, and allows Minaj's rhymes to be the focal point, all of which gives the song "something of a mixtape feel" according to Joe Rivers of No Ripcord. In his review of the song, Unterberger of Popdust noted Hit-Boy's modern hip hop production, saying "Diplo and Bangladesh might have to watch their back after the up-and-comers contributions to this album." Adam Fleischer of XXL said "Nicki dishes boast- heavy verses about how she’s better than all these other bitches." ==Critical reception== "I Am Your Leader" received positive reviews from critics. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust gave it a 4-star rating, complimenting Minaj's rapping as well as the guest verses of Cam'ron and Rick Ross. However, Unterberger felt that Minaj was overshadowed by the guest verses. Andrew Hampp of Billboard echoed Unterberger's sentiments, saying "The nostalgia of Cam's return trumps the overall catchiness of the song." XXL Magazine stated that "Though many of the early songs [on the album] lack real substance, the records remain generally exciting - “I Am Your Leader,” alongside Rick Ross and Cam’ron, “Beez In The Trap” with 2 Chainz, and the triumphant “Champion” featuring Nas, Drake and Young Jeezy are all memorable moments". Joe Rivers No Ripcord praised "I Am Your Leader" along with "Beez in the Trap" for being "thrilling" and making "good use of cameos". Stephen Deusner of Paste Magazine said that "On the nursery rhyming “I Am Your Leader,” [Minaj] spits yet another dick joke like a playground jeer, slyly undermining hip-hop's traditionally male-centric braggadocio. She's not only participating in phallocentric boasting; she's also inflating the convention with a Swedish penis pump until it's just shy of bursting". David Jeffries of Allmusic listed it as one of the best tracks on the album. Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine stated that "'I Am Your Leader' and 'Beez in the Trap' [are] two excellent tracks which manage to sound both bubbly and heavy as Minaj delivers her most effortlessly entertaining shit-talk to date". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork called "Come On A Cone" and "I Am Your Leader" "two brilliantly off-kilter songs". Tom Ewing of The Guardian said that "On "I Am Your Leader", [Minaj] drops a couple of octaves to gleefully pompous effect". Kevin Ritchie of NOW Magazine named it the top track of the album. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly named it one of the best tracks on the album along with "Champion". ==Promotion== ===Music video=== The video begins with a pink mailbox with the song's title on the front written in different fonts. It is set in an esque brightly coloured playhouse. Minaj raps her first verse in a spacious room filled with antler heads and wacky windows and is seen standing on a zebra print carpet. Minaj is then seen in a bathtub, partially clothed, wearing only Alexander McQueen “Armadillo” jewel encrusted 12-inch stiletto shoes. She wears a green, Marilyn Monroe inspired wig. This is followed by a scene with all three rappers. After the hook, Rick Ross is seen sitting on a gold banquet table reciting his rap, shirtless, while gold mannequins ascend behind him. For Cam'ron's verse the scene is located on a staircase of moving photos of the three rappers. Nicki's Young Money labelmate, Tyga also makes a brief cameo appearance in the clip. The video garnered positive reviews from critics, noting its high energy, fun and "wackiness". MTV's Rob Markman gave the video a positive review saying, "Only in a Nicki Minaj video can you find two of rap's hardest street figures performing in such a wacky setting, but it's the juxtaposition that 'I Am Your Leader' offers which makes it so fun." ===Live performances=== Minaj performed the song for the first time on The Today Show's summer concert series on August 14, 2012. ==Credits and personnel== ;Recording * Recorded at: Conway Studios in Los Angeles, California. ;Personnel * Nicki Minaj – songwriting, vocals * Rick Ross – songwriting, vocals * Cam'ron – songwriting, vocals * Fernando Garibay – production, songwriting * Hitboy – production, songwriting * Ariel Chabaz – recording, mixing * John Rivers – recording, mastering * Jon Sher – recording and mixing assistant Credits adapted from Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded liner notes. ==Charts== Chart (2012) Peak position ==References== Category:2012 songs Category:Nicki Minaj songs Category:Cam'ron songs Category:Rick Ross songs Category:Music videos directed by Colin Tilley Category:Songs written by Nicki Minaj Category:Songs written by Cam'ron Category:Songs written by Rick Ross Category:Song recordings produced by Hit-Boy Category:Songs written by Hit-Boy Category:Songs written by Fernando Garibay
35522192	I Choose Jesus	I Choose Jesus is the first studio album by contemporary Christian musician Moriah Peters, released on April 17, 2012 by Reunion Records. ==Reception== ===Commercial response=== ===Critical response=== This album was met with mostly positive acclaim from the critics. The most positive review came in from New Release Tuesday that gave it a perfect five. Sarah Fine wrote for that publication, and said the album "is quite possibly the best debut from a female vocalist Christian music has seen since Francesca Battistelli's My Paper Heart back in 2008. Musically fun, relevant and inspiring, Moriah's passion is evident on each track and her personal convictions coming as the driving force behind the lyrics take each song and send it soaring to new heights. This will undoubtedly go down as one of my top 10 albums of 2012, and I hope to see this debut catapult her to the same level of success the aforementioned Battistelli found with hers." There were two four-and-a-half- out-of-five's of a nine-out-of-a-ten that were garnered by the album from The Christian Manifesto, Louder Than the Music and Cross Rhythms. To This, The Christian Manifesto's Lydia Akinola wrote that "I Choose Jesus is a packed full with insightful, thoughtful messages that a listener of any age could learn from. That makes it a debut that we should all choose." Likewise, Jono Davies of Louder Than the Music wrote that "I wouldn't describe Moriah as bubblegum pop, that would be unfair. Yet she does have a very pop-feel to her music. I would describe her as sounding a bit like fellow female vocalists Kari Jobie [sic] and Audrey Assad." Furthermore, Davies said that "The whole album is actually full of very pleasant songs, sung with Moriah's mellifluous voice that you can not help but like. Even if you're a rock lover or a dance raver, this is music that doesn't offend. The album has a mix of songs directly about Jesus and His love, to songs that have very positive messages about living a good life. It's taken me a whole review to work out who I think she sounds like, and it's Philippa Hanna who as you may know, I think very highly of as an artist. They both have rich and wonderful harmonious voices that you could just listen to all day." Davies called it a "Great album." Lastly, Cross Rhythms's Tony Cummings said "With Moriah rising to prominence on the US Christian scene through her vocals in the Veggie Tales DVD 'The Princess And The Popstar' I understandably expected some rather vacuous tweenie pop music on the singer's debut. In fact, there's not an autotuner or a predictable synth riff in earshot and thanks to the sure hand of producer Ed Cash (Chris Tomlin, Bebo Norman) the sound here is organic enough so that one has to take seriously the 19 year old's album." This album had one lone 4.25-out-of-five rating from Christian Music Zine, and Joshua Andre said that "Moriah Peters has skilfully crafted 10 gems with many treasures to find every listen. With a fresh and appealing outlook on life unlike other female mainstream artists, Moriah has exquisitely used her youth and creativity to her advantage, also dropping in personal stories into the songs making them more relatable to the listener." Andre wrote "One of my favourite female artist pop albums this year along with Lindsay McCaul and Britt Nicole, Moriah will undoubtedly grow up to be a very influential artist in Christian music. Hats off to you Moriah, what a insightful bag of goodies you have released!" The two four-out-of-five review scores came from AllMusic and Indie Vision Music. To this, AllMusic's Andree Farias wrote that "I Choose Jesus, sounds like nothing on the Christian pop airwaves in 2012, yet catches the ear with its quirky melodies, bright-eyed spirit, and pop sensibility reminiscent of Colbie Caillat, Sara Bareilles, and Brooke Fraser, but with exuberance very much her own. Peters comes across as a bubbly personality, and the childlike heart with which she sells these songs, many of them unabashed declarations of faith, makes it impossible to dismiss her as yet another dime-a-dozen girl with a guitar. Starlets her age often try to appear too cool for school, even in Christian music, but Peters seems unconcerned with appearances" Furthermore, Jonathan Andre of Indie Vision Music wrote that the album being "Produced by Ed Cash, and with co-writes with Ed, the Write Brothers, Ian Eskelin, Cindy Morgan and Chris August; this is an album that will definitely fit into a playlist surrounded with Audrey Assad, Sara Groves and Jamie Grace. With the lyrical maturity beyond her years, Moriah incorporates smart songwriting with musical genius to create 10 tracks of easy-listening, yet at the same time, songs that will motivate and encourage the listener. This is a must album if you enjoy music from Audrey, Sara, Jamie, or even Dara MacLean and Rebecca St. James. This, along with Jamie Grace’s One Song at a Time and Lindsay McCaul’s If it Leads Me Back are my favourites from debut artists over the past 6 months." However, the critical reviews come in from Jesus Freak Hideout and The Phantom Tollbooth, who gave the album a three-and-a-half-out- of-five. The more hopeful of these was Michael Dalton, who wrote for The Phantom Tollbooth that the album "...reminds me of my first love. A faith in Christ that is fresh and vital energizes these songs." Finally, Dalton wrote that "This is a fine debut that calls to mind the first release by an artist that shares some of the same ethnicity (Peters is of Mexican-French heritage), who has gone on to bloom in her own way. I write of Jaci Velasquez, who inspired Peters to become a Christian singer. Until she heard Velasquez, Peters thought she had a 'froggy' voice. On the contrary, her sound and style is reminiscent of her inspiration. She is a winsome combination of purity and craft." Finally, the most critical review was from Jesus Freak Hideout's Jen Rose, which she said that "Beneath the pop shimmer and her lovely singing is an earnest collection of songs driven by an intentional, confident message. Proclaiming her faith and encouraging others spiritually is the goal from the start, but the message-heavy nature of the songs doesn't detract from their feel-good, catchy quality. Fans of soulful and summery pop music should find plenty to love in Peters' debut and a promising career that can only grow from here." ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart (2012) Peak position ===Singles=== Year Single Peak chart position Peak chart position Peak chart position Peak chart position Peak chart position Peak chart position Year Single US Christian 2012 "I Choose Jesus" 23 "Well Done" 24 ==References== Category:2012 debut albums Category:Reunion Records albums

35584117	I Can Only Imagine (David Guetta song)	"I Can Only Imagine" is a song performed by French DJ David Guetta, featuring vocals from American singer Chris Brown and rapper Lil Wayne, from Guetta's fifth studio album Nothing but the Beat. It was released as the sixth single from the album on April 23, 2012. Prior to its official release, the song charted in the lower regions of the charts in Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Guetta, Brown and Wayne performed the song live for the first time at the 54th Grammy Awards on February 12, 2012. ==Music video== The video was filmed on May 29, 2012, and premiered on July 2, 2012. It was directed by Colin Tilley. Guetta said how the video focuses more on futuristic images rather than on a plot as some of Guetta's other videos played out. It first opens up with Guetta walking into a room, and Brown appears in a mask as his eyes light up. As Brown starts singing in another scene, he is in a light-up suit. As the chorus plays, Brown is seen in a zero-gravity room. Guetta also then seen in the zero-gravity room. Wayne then is seen with a skateboard with a few other skateboarders in the background. Wayne is also located in another futuristic room. Brown is then seen in another room with a lit-up floor as he dances while he sings the chorus. Five other dancers join Brown. ==Track listing== ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2011–12) Peak position Italy (FIMI) 59 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 Tipparade) 4 Romania (Romanian Top 100) 36 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2012) Position France (SNEP) 165 ===Certifications=== ==Release history== Region Date Format United States February 13, 2012 Digital download — Live at the 54th Grammy Awards Various April 23, 2012 Digital download — Beatport exclusive Australia May 2, 2012 Digital download Austria Belgium Finland Germany Italy Japan Netherlands New Zealand Norway Switzerland United States August 7, 2012 Mainstream airplay ==References== Category:2012 singles Category:David Guetta songs Category:Lil Wayne songs Category:Songs written by David Guetta Category:Songs written by Lil Wayne Category:Chris Brown songs Category:Music videos directed by Colin Tilley Category:Songs written by Nasri (musician) Category:Songs written by Chris Brown Category:Songs written by Frédéric Riesterer Category:Songs written by Giorgio Tuinfort Category:Song recordings produced by David Guetta Category:Songs written by Jacob Luttrell
35717183	I AM THE BEST ARTIST Rene	Beginning in the late 1970s, and continuing into the 1990s in New York City, several prominently located murals of impressive size proclaimed I AM THE BEST ARTIST to all who walked or drove past them along the streets of SoHo. The murals were the creations of artist René Moncada, who lived in the neighborhood. René Moncada's I AM THE BEST ARTIST murals became icons not only of the neighborhood's art world associations but of the era in general, when art became a profitable commodity and SoHo became its Wall Street. The murals have been likened to effective advertising slogans and recognized as an early act of "art provocation". The murals placed René at the forefront of street artists of the era and helped transform the streets of the art district into an alternative exhibition venue. ==Background== René has described the murals as a thumb in the nose to the art community he helped pioneer but by which he later felt ignored. The artist — a very vocal opponent of censorship, hypocrisy and oppression — explains some of his activities as stemming from a desire to liberate not only the art world but also the world at large. It is attributes such as that, he has reflected in hindsight, which may qualify him as "the best artist", having nothing to do with artistic skills. René's ubiquitous declarations, spelled out in large, capital letters punctuated by his signature "René" written in a flowing font, were a topic of conversation and debate at the time, and provided a backdrop to photographs taken by a multitude of tourists, art students and advertising layouts in magazines worldwide. == Locations== Mural locations were centered along the stretch of West Broadway between Houston Street and Canal Street. The most prominent mural, near the corner of Broome Street and West Broadway (pictured above), measured 10 feet by 50. The largest of the murals was located on a wall along the southwest corner of West Broadway where Grand Street intersects. This location appears in a montage sequence of the 1987 movie The Secret of My Success, in which a young Cindy Crawford makes an un-credited appearance walking past the mural, catching the eye of the lead character played by Michael J. Fox. The mural was featured prominently among other iconic images of 1980s New York City in general, and SoHo in particular. Another prominent mural spanning the length of a parking lot wall on Wooster Street was painted at a height so that it would be visible above parked cars. René's gallery space and home was across the street from this lot. == Conflicts and criticism == René always insisted he obtained permission from landlords to paint the murals, but requests were also sometimes refused, with some SoHo residents commenting that although a mural would be welcome on their property, an I AM THE BEST ARTIST mural would not be welcome. In the case of one refusal, René painted the attendants' stand of the parking lot facing the declined property, getting permission from its owner instead. Another dispute involved a French artist named Le Pointre who tried to claim use of a wall for which René insisted he'd already obtained permission to paint a mural. Vandals often defaced these walls with sarcastic embellishment such as "I Am The Best Fartist" and "I Am The Best Anus", or added simplistic commentary such as "No No No" or "I hate you". Graffiti artists of the era also occasionally obscured the murals with their own work. IATBA murals which may have been defaced would be faithfully repainted by René. René claims the art critic Robert Hughes once assured him directly that he was not, in fact, the best artist. An Artforum writer used an unrelated art review to shine a negative light on The Best Artist, calling René "untalented" and "unchic". Loss of long-time artist friends was another unfortunate consequence. === Legal case === One of the murals located along West Broadway was across the street from a gallery owned by Lynn Rubin. René claimed to have obtained permission from the owner of the building to paint the mural at that location. When it came to his attention that Rubin was having her staff paint over the mural, René arrived to videotape them. Rubin tried to stop him from recording, and it was then, René alleges in a lawsuit filed against her, that she assaulted him by pushing the camcorder into his face, causing him hardship and suffering. The outcome of the lawsuit was not published, but René's murals, and the related legal proceedings, raised discussion about intellectual property, artist's rights, and the First Amendment. ==IATBA Gallery== René opened his storefront space at 147 Wooster Street, SoHo, as "René's Gallery" in 1977. He opened it to showcase his own artwork — a "monument to himself", as described by John Strausbaugh in a New York Press article of the era — and also used the space to the rear of the gallery as his studio. As René's signature murals gained notoriety, his gallery was also called "I AM THE BEST ARTIST gallery". The gallery was also the site of fashion shows, events by performance artists such as Annie Sprinkle, and exhibitions of artwork by, among others, ballpoint pen artist Lennie Mace, whose exhibition publicity listed the gallery indistinctly as 147 Wooster Gallery. René naively thought opening his own gallery would earn entry into the burgeoning SoHo art set, and went about inviting neighboring gallery owners to come for studio visits or private viewings, but his invitations — and presence in general — went largely ignored. == End of the murals == As the neighborhood went upscale and the value of blank wall space rose with property values, I AM THE BEST ARTIST murals were one-by-one covered by billboards or otherwise destroyed in the 1990s. One was removed after the landlord demanded $500 per month to allow René's mural to remain. René later adapted the phrase's abbreviation (IATBA) into his signature - and a surname of sorts. René no longer occupies his long-time Wooster Street space. == See also == * Street art == References == ==External links== * Rene Moncada's official website * Annie Sprinkle's official website * Lennie Mace's official website Category:Murals in New York City Category:1986 paintings Category:Vandalized works of art in New York City

35823796	I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It!	I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! (sometimes I Can See the Whole Room and There's Nobody in It! or simply I Can See the Whole Room!) is a 1961 painting by Roy Lichtenstein. It is a painting of a man looking through a peephole. It formerly held the record for highest auction price for a Lichtenstein painting. The work is based on a William Overgard-drawn comics panel from a Steve Roper cartoon. Lichtenstein's derivation augments the presentation of the narrative and expands the use of color in the image. As with the original the image employs the theme of vision, and focuses specifically on mechanized vision as well as monocularity. ==Description of the artwork== Based on a 1961 William Overgard drawing for a Steve Roper cartoon story published by the Publishers Syndicate on August 6, 1961, Lichtenstein’s I Can See the Whole Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil. The painting depicts a man looking through a hole in a door. His finger is extended to open a circular peephole, while simultaneously allowing the artist to present his face. The painting also uses a speech balloon. The picture teases the viewer who is given the feeling that they are in a dark room being viewed by the main subject of the painting who is a man that peeks through a hole in the door. The narrative element of the image, which included a speech bubble that presents the caption "I Can See the Whole Room and There's Nobody in It", clarifies that the man can not see anything in the room although he has a good look at it. The work is a satirical reference to abstraction because it can be imagined as a monochrome canvas that is affected by an actor that has inserted his finger as well as a narrative that also violates this imagining. This finger is also regarded as phallic. The speech bubble makes the entire canvas relevant by broadening the attention to the entire width of the painting and the curves of the bubble unite the narrative with several of the picture's other graphical elements. Lichtenstein has added color, including all of the primary colors, while transforming the original and making reference to mechanical reproduction via Ben-Day dots. Like Look Mickey, there is reason to describe this image as a self-portrait of sorts. The subject is extending a finger through a circular opening, which is a self-reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of stenciling Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from a finger. An alternative self- representation is interpreted as a singular peephole that represents the monocular subject matter of Lichtenstein's training, while the entire canvas represents a doubt in this training's representation of the physical body, its perception and its actual view. However, the corporeal is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and the dotted coloration of the skin. The work is an example of Lichtenstein's presentation of the uncertainty of the one-eyed perspective. It is considered to be a work on the subject of "focal vision and blindness", and it is a prominent example of the theme running through Lichtenstein's art relating to vision. He uses the narrative to emphasize this theme, while playing on both the circular peephole and the circular eyes. The depicted mechanical device, a peephole in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format. Monocularity is funnelled through the primitive peephole apparatus that almost mimics a camera lens. In some senses, monocularity of this work is a strong theme that is directly embodied although only by allusion. In addition, the work is considered to be closely related to his later work, Image Duplicator (1963), which is regarded as a correction of I Can See the Whole Room! with its glaring and aggressive binocularity. The monocularity of I Can See the Whole Room! should be viewed as a concentrated form of monocularity, such as "the common experience of closing one eye in order to fix an object in the gaze", but a subordinated form of monocularity that is enhanced by technology. ==Ownership of the artwork, and at auction== The painting was purchased by art and design director / collector Emily Hall Tremaine and her husband in 1961 for $550. From 1961-87, Tremaine lent the artwork to many exhibitions, and she extensively facilitated reproduction of the artwork in various media. Several photos of the artwork were taken over the years as installed in a glass barn on the Tremaine farmhouse property in Madison, CT. A photograph of an installation view, featuring I can see the whole room… and there’s nobody in it!, was taken as part of Louise Lawler's Tremaine pictures series in 1984. This second artwork has also been in many exhibitions over the years.(March 15, 2019). Roy Lichtenstein. I can see the whole room… and there’s nobody in it!, (1961). artdesigncafe. Retrieved March 28, 2020. After Tremaine's death, the painting was sold at Christie's New York for $2.1 million to Steve Ross. His wife, collector Courtney Sale Ross, then sold the artwork for $43.2 million, double its estimate, at Christie's New York. It surpassed the $42.6 million record set for the artist the previous November by Ohhh...Alright... The following May, it was surpassed by Lichtenstein's Sleeping Girl, which sold for $44.8 million. ==See also== * 1961 in art ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== *Lichtenstein Foundation website *Christies presentation *Showroom video *record-setting sale press release Category:1961 paintings Category:Paintings by Roy Lichtenstein

3617328	I Ain't Got Time to Tarry	"I Ain't Got Time to Tarry", also known as "The Land of Freedom", is an American song written by blackface minstrel composer Dan Emmett. It premiered in a minstrel show performance by Bryant's Minstrels in late November 1858. The song was published in New York City in 1859. The lyrics tell of a black man in the Northern United States who is homesick for the South. He decides to return to the South, as illustrated in the chorus: :For I'se gwine home to Dinah, :Yes, I am gwine home. :Den I ain't got time to tarry, I ain't got time to dwell, :I'm bound to de land of freedom, oh, niggars! fare you well.Bryant's Power of Music, New York, 1859. Quoted in Nathan 354. The pining ex-slave scenario was a common idiom of blackface minstrelsy during the 1850s. Emmett would repeat it in other songs, including "Johnny Roach" and "Dixie".Emmett's authorship of "Dixie" is contested; see "Dixie" (song). Emmett's later "I'm Going Home to Dixie" reuses the tune to "I Ain't Got Time to Tarry". ==Notes== ==References== * Nathan, Hans (1962). Dan Emmett and the Rise of Early Negro Minstrelsy.

36330444	I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me	"I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me" is the third episode of the sixth season of the American television medical drama Grey's Anatomy, and the show's 105th episode overall. It was written by Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, and directed by Michael Pressman. The episode was originally broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on October 1, 2009. In the episode, the physicians of Seattle Grace struggle to maintain their jobs as the hospital merges with Mercy West. Further storylines include Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) returning to work full-time, too quickly after her surgery, and Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) working under Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw). Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, filming primarily took place in Los Angeles, California. Adrienne Barbeau and James Frain made their first guest appearances, while Sarah Utterback, Mark Saul, and Molly Kidder reprised their roles as guest- stars. The episode's title refers to the song "I Always Feel Like", by American hip hop group TRU. "I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me" opened to positive critical reviews, with Chyler Leigh's (Dr. Lexie Grey) and Oh's performance praised in particular. Upon its initial airing, the episode was viewed by 15.69 million Americans, and garnered a 6.1/16 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic, ranking #3 for the night in terms of viewership. ==Plot== Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) tries to convince pediatric surgeon Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) to place her on her service, to which she agrees. A trauma victim is brought into the emergency room, with the surgical residents all trying to impress the superior physicians, in hope that their job will be preserved, come the merger. Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) returns to full-time work quickly after her cancer treatment, showcasing an auburn wig. Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is assigned to the trauma victim, and while transferring blood to the operating room, she slips while running. Dismayed with the merger, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) condemns the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.) for initiating it, only to be yelled at. Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is optimistic, assuring everyone that they will keep their jobs. A patient, Jodie Crawley (Adrienne Barbeau), and her son with schizophrenia, Tom (James Frain), is brought into the hospital with a moving growth inside her stomach, claimed to be an alien by her son. Yang expresses difficulty connecting with the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a name tag, so he attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them that it is the right thing to do. An obstetrics and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a caesarian section, but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang. Stevens assists Shepherd with a five-hour craniotomy, and Karev is fearful that she cannot handle it, although she is ultimately able to complete the surgery. At the conclusion of the episode, human resources sends out an email notifying Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback) and Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul)'s wife Megan (Molly Kidder), that they have been fired. ==Production== The episode was written by Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, and directed by Michael Pressman. David Greenspan edited the episode, and Donald Lee Harris served as production designer. The episode's title refers to the song "I Always Feel Like", by American hip hop group TRU. Featured music includes Gossip's "Pop Goes the World" and Ingrid Michaelson's "The Chain". Rater intended the theme of the episode to be "paranoia", elaborating: "After Richard dropped the bomb that the hospital would be merging with Mercy West, we knew that this episode would have to deal with people's paranoia. Because merger means change. And change means fear. And the worst kind of fear is the kind that lives in your head. The dark thoughts. The paranoia. The worst case scenarios that you play out that usually don't come true. And with Richard holing himself up inside his office, it's just a breeding ground for rumor, fear and paranoia. So, when we started talking about this episode, the theme of paranoia emerged pretty quickly." All storylines in the episode were inspired by Rater's friend base, including the story on schizophrenia. She offered her insight: At the conclusion of the episode, several physicians played a game of baseball to cheer up. Rater called it "her favorite scene", explaining: "I loved the scene where Owen, Derek and Mark take Cristina, Meredith and Lexie to the baseball field. This is one of the first times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. And I love that he makes her leave the hospital, focus on something else. That's why he's so good for her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball. But when I finally saw it, it makes me want to write more scenes like that, with our doctors outside of the hospital, little glimpses of them in real life." ==Reception== === Broadcasting === "I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me" was first broadcast on October 1, 2009 in the United States on ABC. The episode was viewed by a total of 15.69 million Americans, down 1.34% from the previous episode "Goodbye", which garnered 17.03 million viewers. In terms of viewership, "I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me" ranked third for the night, just behind CBS's juggernauts CSI and The Mentalist. The episode did not win in viewership, but its 6.1/16 Nielsen rating ranked first in its 9:00 Eastern time-slot and the entire night, for both the rating and share percentages of the key 18–49 demographic, beating out CSI, The Mentalist, Private Practice, and The Office. Although its rating won for the night, it was a decrease from the previous episode, which garnered a 6.7/17 rating/share in the 18–49 demographic. === Critical reception === The episode was generally well received among television critics. Steve Marsi of TV Fanatic called Yang being on pediatrics "an epic-fail", but praised the humor given by Oh. He also called Lexie's storyline "endearing and sad to watch", writing that overall, the episode was "classic Grey's Anatomy". PopSugar gave a positive review of the episode, writing: "Derek and Mark seem to be the only ones who are keeping their cool." However, they also felt that Meredith was "out of character", commenting: "Though Meredith also kept it together, her optimism is so out of character that it can only be chalked up to the crisis, and even she recognizes it." While Yang was on pediatric service, she impersonated a bear, and PopSugar called her voice "priceless". They were also positive about Stevens' storyline, saying: "At first it seemed super annoying but was pretty sweet by the end of the episode." PopSugar also enjoyed Lexie's storyline, commenting that "she proves her worth in the end". Cinema Blend Amanda Krill said Stevens' wig looked like a "Stepford Wives wig", adding: "Everyone has a hard time not looking at it. She's still a cancer patient, but she knows that her job is on the line just like everyone else's. Everyone is working round the clock, showing up at every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." Krill also enjoyed Oh's performance as Yang, writing: "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides a chuckle or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she will be able to do all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, better. Things don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids are a little more resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really like kids sense of outing." Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s how I know my job is safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post disliked Stevens' wig, writing: "Izzie's wig looked horrible. She looked exactly like her mother Robbie and that's not a compliment. I loved Cristina's Stepford wife joke and how everyone, including Derek, couldn't help but stare at her hair. Yet, no one had the balls to tell her it was bad." Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance as Lexie, commenting: "This was one episode I felt that Lexie was a genuine character. She still maintained that book-smart ability to repeat facts (like the merger cases) and shows a command of medical situations." He too found Oh's bear voice comical, adding: "I laughed when Cristina attempted to do her voice for Mr. Bear because you knew that she didn't know what she was doing." Pascua was shocked with the departure of Utterbacks' character, writing: "I can't believe that they cut Nurse Olivia. I understand that she wasn't really around, but having her as a tertiary character was nice. It was kind of ass-y of the chief not to personally tell these people that they were being cut, but it made Derek look really chivalrous." ==References== ==External links== *"I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me" at ABC.com * Category:Grey's Anatomy (season 6) episodes Category:2009 American television episodes
3636427	I Can Blink	I Can Blink is an American children's picture book written and illustrated by Frank Asch. It was published in 1985 by Kids Can Press, and printed by Everbest in Hong Kong. The book consists of a series of simple sentences, with definite parallel structure. Children are encouraged to put their face through a circle cut out of the book, and proceed with the facial actions described. The book fosters both understanding of animals, of body parts, and of movements. ==Plot== Uniquely, the written "plot" starts on the cover, with the phrase "I can blink like an owl." The book continues, encouraging children to sniff like a dog, snap like a turtle, chew like a cow, shake their head like a horse, puff their cheeks like a squirrel, stick out their tongue like a snake, smile like a monkey, scrunch their face like a walrus, and wiggle their nose like a rabbit. The last page is an image of a flower, which has no associated action or text. ==References== *Books For Keeps - Reviewed in BfK No. 56 (May 1989) by Moira Small) * Category:American picture books Category:1985 children's books

3645476	I Am Curious (Blue)	I Am Curious (Blue), whose original Swedish title, Jag är nyfiken – en film i blått, translates as "I Am Curious – A Film in Blue," is a 1968 Swedish film directed by Vilgot Sjöman and starring Lena Nyman as a character named after herself. It is a companion film to 1967's I Am Curious (Yellow); the two were initially intended to be one 3½ hour film.Vilgot Sjöman, I Was Curious: Diary of the Making of a Film (Grove Press, 1968). The films are named after the colours of the Swedish flag. Blue is a second version of Yellow, taking place before and after the first film.

While hiking, Lena also looks into a cabin and sees two women having lesbian sex. Lena returns to Stockholm, where she stays with the couple Hans and Bim. Bim notices Lena scratching herself, which Lena attributes to allergies. After Hans and Bim have an argument, Hans visits Lena in her bedroom. Bim enters with a magnifying glass and insists on looking at Lena's hand. She discovers Lena has scabies, disproving Lena's belief her constant itching owed to allergies and mosquito bites. Lena approaches Börje in the car dealership where he now works, to inform him about the possibility that he also has scabies. He confirms he has been itching and accuses her of giving him the disease, citing her sexual promiscuity. She argues back he is just as promiscuous, resulting in a highly public heated argument.

3663908	I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One	I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is the eighth studio album by the American indie rock band Yo La Tengo, released on April 22, 1997, by Matador Records. It was produced by Roger Moutenot and recorded at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee. The album expands the guitar-based pop of its predecessor Electr-O- Pura to encompass a variety of other music genres, including bossa nova, krautrock, and electronic music. Most of the songs on the album deal with melancholy emotions and range from short and fragile ballads to long and open- ended dissonance. Upon release, I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One reached number 19 on the Billboards Heatseekers Albums chart, becoming the first Yo La Tengo album to enter the charts. Three songs from the album, "Autumn Sweater", "Sugarcube", and the cover "Little Honda", were released as singles. The album received widespread acclaim from music critics, who praised the band's ability to successfully expand the boundaries of nearly any pop style. The album is widely regarded as the band's best work and is frequently included on several publications' best album lists. In 2020, Rolling Stone included it on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. ==Background and recording== I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is the follow-up to Yo La Tengo's highly acclaimed 1995 album Electr-O-Pura, which was ranked at number 9 in The Village Voices 1995 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative direction for the band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album is going to sound like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right." At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One was recorded at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee and produced by Roger Moutenot, who also produced the band's previous two albums. Kaplan described the recording sessions of the album as follows: "We hole up in a room and work for a really long time. Then we come out and blink our eyes because it's sunny out". Initially, the band did not intend to write a long album, but eventually felt that having a long album was the only way to accommodate the instrumental track "Spec Bebop", which the band felt it needed to be included in the album "by hook or by crook". I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is the only Yo La Tengo album that was recorded on an ADAT magnetic tape format, even though it was mixed to analog later. Audio mixing took place at Big House and Magic Shop in New York City. ==Music and lyrics== I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One expands Electr- O-Puras guitar-based pop to encompass a variety of other music genres, ranging from the bossa nova soundscapes of "Center of Gravity" to the electronic grooves of "Autumn Sweater", the krautrock jams of "Spec Bebop", the "jazzy goof" of "Moby Octopad", the trip hop sound of "Damage", and the psychedelic folk instrumentation of "We're an American Band", among others. The album also contains two cover songs: "Little Honda", a Beach Boys tune written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love, and "My Little Corner of the World", recorded by Anita Bryant, although the band initially did not know she had ever recorded it. The former, which is a song that Kaplan learned for a solo guitar show, was originally used to make sure the recording equipment was set up right. However, it was ultimately included in the album because, according to bassist James McNew, "it just sort of turned out pretty good." The title to the song "Moby Octopad" is a reference to Yo La Tengo's appearance on the 1995 Lollapalooza tour, where the band performed mid-afternoon sets on the festival's side stage. Often performing earlier in the afternoon was the artist Moby. One of the instruments that Moby used in his performance was the Roland Octapad, an electronic percussion instrument. When taking the stage for their own performance, Yo La Tengo frequently noticed road crew's tape with "MOBY OCTAPAD" written on it, still left on the stage after Moby's set. The band later used this anecdote as the title for an instrumental that they were jamming on. Lyrics unrelated to the Moby story were added later. Most of the lyrics on I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One deal with melancholy emotions. The track "Stockholm Syndrome", which is the first Yo La Tengo song sung by McNew, is about captives eventually expressing empathy toward their captors and vice versa. It was described by prominent music critic Robert Christgau as a "simulated Neil Young ballad". The song "Autumn Sweater", which is layered with complex rhythms and textures, explores themes of love and lack of communication, while "Center of Gravity" has been described as "a simple lo-fi devotional love song". I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One also marks the debut of Kaplan's falsetto singing, which was said to blur the line between his voice and that of drummer Georgia Hubley. The album's title is taken from a line in an unknown film. According to Kaplan, "I think it's a nice, evocative title—it seems to mean a lot but it doesn't really mean anything. It comes from a movie, but I'm not telling what movie. You'll have to see it one day and say, 'Eureka!'" ==Release== I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One was released on April 22, 1997, by the independent record label Matador Records. The album reached number 19 on the Billboards Heatseekers Albums chart, becoming the first Yo La Tengo album to enter the charts. Three songs from the album, "Autumn Sweater", "Sugarcube", and "Little Honda", were released as singles or EPs in 1997. A music video featuring Mr. Show with Bob and Davids comedians David Cross and Bob Odenkirk was made for "Sugarcube". The song "Moby Octopad", which was not released as a single, peaked at number 4 on the KEXP Top 90.3 Album Chart in 1997. As of March 2000, I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One has sold 73,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan, becoming Yo La Tengo's most commercially successful album at the time. In 2012, The Daily Beast reported that the record had sold 300,000 copies since release. An insert card in the CD release parodied the marketing leaflets that are sometimes inserted into the jewel case for a compact disc, promoting other products from the same label. It "advertised" albums by imaginary artists, like "Condo Fucks", "Unsanitary Napkins", and "Künstler" in a variety of genres. In 2008, Yo La Tengo followed up on the joke by releasing Fuckbook, an album of covers credited to the "Condo Fucks". ==Critical reception== Upon release, I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One received widespread acclaim from music critics. Matt Diehl of Rolling Stone felt that the album "proves that Yo La Tengo can master nearly any pop style [...] the music's ominousness is undercut by Yo La Tengo's infectious joy at simply making noise. It's just this joy that makes Yo La Tengo stand out amid their indie-rock peers". Similarly, in his review for Spin, Robert Christgau said that the album gave the band "the grace to professionalize toward the pop melodicism they've always loved." He also felt that the first nine songs were perfect and considered "Autumn Sweater" as the "very peak" of the album. Chicago Tribune reviewer Greg Kot highlighted the album's diverse influences, stating that the band "fashions sprawling albums out of minimal instrumental strokes and soft voices." The album's range of power and soft elements was noted. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, David Browne said that, while the band has always been "adept at striking a balance between hurricane-force dissonance and fragile serenity", Yo La Tengo "crack open their sound even wider here. Their muted, after-hours guitar drone is in full effect [...] As adults who still need to make a racket, they remain addicted to noise, but now the trio integrates the feedback into the arrangements, like squalls rumbling in the distance." Dele Fadele of NME also praised the open-ended nature of the album, but criticized the instrumental "Spec Bebop" for being "constructed around some hurtful feedback, to end up as an endurance test." In a very positive review, Jason Josephes of Pitchfork praised the album for exploring new directions, commenting that the band takes its "sonic inventions to new levels." I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One was ranked number 5 in The Village Voices 1997 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, the band's highest position to date. In the poll's accompanying essay, Christgau referred to the album as one of his "favorite albums of the year, easy", alongside those by Pavement, Sleater-Kinney, and Arto Lindsay. Similarly, editors of NME magazine placed the album at number 19 in their albums of the year list for 1997, while Spin journalists placed the album at number 8 in their list of Top 20 Albums of the Year. ==Legacy== Retrospectively, I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is widely regarded as the band's best work. AllMusic reviewer Fred Thomas described it as "a definitive master statement. The subtly shifting moods and wide, curious palette of stylistic exploration resulted in a lasting indie rock classic, essential listening and also something of a blueprint for much of what followed from like-minded bands for years to come." The A.V. Club editor John Krewson remarked that the album marked the point when the band started to "[dabble] on electronica" with songs such as "Moby Octopad" and "Autumn Sweater", calling it "an example of a band having great fun exploring the possibilities of pop music." In his review of the band's 2003 album Summer Sun, Christgau praised I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One as Yo La Tengo's "career album", commenting that "It's no challenge or insult to state categorically that they'll never top it." In 2017, Pitchfork writer Marc Hogan described the record as the band's "first true masterpiece." I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is frequently included on several publications' best album lists. In 1999, the record was ranked number 78 on Spins list of The 90 Greatest Albums of the '90s. In 2003, Pitchfork ranked it number 25 on its list of the Top 100 albums of the 1990s, later placing it at number 73 in an updated 2022 list. Similarly, Rolling Stone placed the record at number 86 on its 2010 compilation of 100 Best Albums of the Nineties. In 2012, the album appeared at number 22 on Pastes list of The 90 Best Albums of the 1990s. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked Beating as One number 423 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. * Yo La Tengo – performers, writers (tracks 1–8; 10–15) * Roger Moutenot – production * Greg Calbi – mastering * Jad Fair – artwork * Steve Thornton – photography * Al Perkins – lap steel guitar (track 2 and 11) * Burt Bacharach – composer (track 2, "Bird Bath") * Jonathan Marx – trumpet (track 6) ==Charts== Chart performance for I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One Chart (1997) Peak position US Top Heatseekers Albums (Billboard) 19 2022 chart performance for I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One Chart (2022) Peak position ==References== == External links == * Category:1997 albums Category:Albums produced by Roger Moutenot Category:Matador Records albums Category:Yo La Tengo albums

36980268	I Awake	I Awake is the fourth studio album by Australian singer-songwriter Sarah Blasko, released in Australia on 26 October 2012. At the J Awards of 2012, the album was nominated for Australian Album of the Year. ==Background and development== Blasko assumed the role of producer for this album, and the recording of it brought the artist back to Atlantic Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where her third album, As Day Follows Night, was recorded. Orchestral elements were recorded in May, 2012 in Sofia, Bulgaria with the help of a 52-piece orchestra provided by Bulgaria's New Symphony Orchestra. ==Release and promotion== Teasing of I Awake began on 10 April 2012, when the singer published a clip of a recording session in Atlantic Studios via her YouTube channel. Two clips of a Bulgarian Symphony Orchestra recording some material were then shared in May, 2012 via the same channel. Finally, the artist added five short clips to her YouTube account between 3 September 2012 and 9 September 2012. The album and its eponymous first single was officially announced via her website and her Facebook page on 10 September 2012. The single was scheduled for release on the iTunes Store on September 17, 2012. The track list of the album was confirmed on her website on 14 September 2012. The first single was officially uploaded to Blasko's YouTube account on 16 September 2012. Pre-ordering for the album began shortly after the release of the first single.

36987436	I Begin	I Begin is the only album by Norwegian black metal band God Seed. It was released on 23 October 2012 in North America and on 30 October 2012 in Europe. ==Background== Following the very public Gorgoroth name dispute, former frontman Gaahl teamed up with former bassist King ov Hell to form the black metal band God Seed. God Seed then released the Live at Wacken CD/DVD, which recreated Gorgoroth's Black Mass Krakow 2004 in its entirety. Between the name dispute and forming the new band, Gaahl retired from black metal. In an interview with Terrorizers John Consterdine, he said, "I was basically just withdrawn from everything concerned with metal." During his self-imposed break from music, Gaahl worked with a project called Wardruna, based around Nordic spiritualism and the runes of the Elder Futhark. When asked why he returned, he replied, "I got a bit of the taste back for it, but I don't know if it will last." He claims that the lyrics are based around "my love for creation and [to] express myself vocally through the music is something that comes up now and again." ==Track listing== ==Critical reception== Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia said of the album, "the songs are tastefully arranged, no matter their inherent violence", and that it "simultaneously nods to the pair's past exploits and then breaks free of the restrictive B.M. aesthetic virtually demanded of Gorgoroth material." Pitchfork's Grayson Currin said, "It would be a stretch to call I Begin a breakthrough for a fresh quinet; it would be dismissive to not consider it perhaps as the start of one." About.com's Craig Hayes wrote, "Wayward and disobedient, I Begin contains the crucial black metal elements to secure God Seed's cold-blooded roots, but it reveals a band harnessing their will to power by determinedly ignoring constraints. That's no surprise given Gaahl and King's defiant ideologies, but I Begin requires you to be receptive to new ideas." ==Personnel== ===God Seed=== * Gaahl – vocals (1–9) * Stian "Sir" Kårstad – guitar (1–5, 7–9) * Lust Kilman – guitar (1–5, 7–9) * King ov Hell – bass (1–5, 7–9) * Geir Bratland – keyboards, Noise (1–11) * Kenneth Kapstad – drums (1–5, 7–10) ===Additional personnel=== * Herbrand Larsen (Enslaved) – vocals on "Hinstu Dagar" * Alexander Jakobsen – vocals on "Alt Liv" * Trym Hartmark Visnes – vocals on "Bloodline" ==References== Category:2012 debut albums Category:God Seed albums Category:Indie Recordings albums

37460382	I Am Anne Frank (American Horror Story)	"I Am Anne Frank" is a two-part episode, consisting of the fourth and fifth episodes of the second season of the FX anthology television series American Horror Story. The first part aired on November 7, 2012, and the second aired on November 14, 2012. The first part is written by Jessica Sharzer and directed by Michael Uppendahl, and the second part is written by Brad Falchuk and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. Both episodes are rated TV-MA (LSV). "Part 2" was nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards in Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or Movie and Outstanding Cinematography for a Miniseries or Movie. The episodes' storylines follow a patient (Franka Potente) admitted to Briarcliff identifying herself as Anne Frank, as well as revealing the identity of the killer known as "Bloody Face". Chloë Sevigny guest stars as Shelley. ==Plot== ===Part 1=== A woman, identifying herself as Anne Frank, is brought to the Briarcliff asylum. She attacks Dr. Arden after finding him to be similar as the doctor of the Auschwitz concentration camp: Hans Grüper. Later, suspected serial murderer Kit begins to question his memory in a meeting with Dr. Thredson: although he is suspected to have killed many people, including his wife, he does not remember such events. Thredson suggests that Lana take aversion therapy to cure her homosexuality. Although initially hesitant, Lana's therapy goes badly, and Thredson promises that he will take Lana when his asylum visit is over. Arden confronts the woman who claims to be Anne Frank, who uses a stolen gun to injure Arden. Upon investigating his laboratory, the woman discovers a disfigured Shelley, who begs Anne to kill her. ===Part 2=== A man named Jim Brown arrives at the asylum claiming "Anne Frank" is his wife Charlotte, who has become obsessed with Anne's story. He takes her home but later returns her after she tries to smother their baby. Dr. Arden suggests Charlotte be lobotomized. Kit is asked by Dr. Thredson to record his admission of the murders on tape. He claims this will help Kit believe what really happened, as well as aid any future legal action to permanently commit him and avoid the death penalty. The recording, in conjunction with Thredson's file, is later used in Kit's arrest for the murders. Jude leaves the asylum after Arden tells her that he is pressing charges against her for allowing a patient to acquire a gun. Arden learns that Mary Eunice had removed the disfigured Shelley from his lab while his wound was being treated at the hospital. Shelley is found in a stairwell near a school playground. Thredson manages to help Lana escape. At his home, Lana finds a lampshade made from human skin and a secret room with tools and drying skin. Thredson, who is revealed to be Bloody Face, traps Lana next to Wendy's frozen corpse. At home, Charlotte appears as a normal wife and mother. She has packed away most of the clippings – but a photo shows a young Hans Grüper behind Adolf Hitler. ==Production== The first part of "I Am Anne Frank" is written by co-executive producer Jessica Sharzer and directed by Michael Uppendahl, and the second part is written by co-creator Brad Falchuk and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. In a November 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke on several episode topics. Regarding the pace of the two-parter and the rest of the season episodes, he said, "American Horror Story is always about a slow rollout of the season of reveals. The pace of these two is a little slower. The scenes are longer and I think more thoughtful than the pace of the first three. These are two of my favorite episodes in the history of the show. Also, in these episodes, I think we really understand the world a little more and what we're trying to write about which is the horror of the insane asylum back in the '50s and '60s and the degradation and the abuse, the real-life horrors. I think we really hit that in a great way in the Anne Frank story." Regarding the decision to do an episode about Anne Frank, Murphy said, "We have a great writing staff but I will take credit for that. One of the things we've done on the show is we take historical figures – last year was the Black Dahlia and this year is Anne Frank. The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. Before we even wrote one word of it, I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season. She loved the story and I sorta swore her to secrecy and God bless her heart she had like five months without telling anybody. I love how it came together." Last season, Murphy had spoken with Zachary Quinto about Dr. Oliver Thredson, who was revealed in "Part 2" as being the serial killer Bloody Face. Quinto stated the knowledge "made it all the more fun for me to build the character in a way that made it seem like he was compassionate and supportive and concerned about the welfare of the patients at Briarcliff, but carrying these ulterior motives." He added that Thredson "carries a lot of secrets with him. He's very intelligent. But he's also very experienced at covering those sects and hiding them and maintaining them. There's a plan. He's fiercely intelligent, and obviously ruthless in his willingness to create this world he's making for himself. He's delusional within himself. He's not trying to sell you a story. He's trying to believe it himself. You will learn more in the coming weeks about what motivated him to these horrific crimes." ==Reception== "Part 1" was watched by 2.65 million viewers, an increase from the previous episode, and received an adult 18-49 rating of 1.5. "Part 2" was watched by 2.78 million viewers and received a 1.6 rating. Rotten Tomatoes reports a 91% approval rating for "Part 1", based on 11 reviews. The critical consensus reads, "The pace is quite measured in comparison to previous episodes in the season, but "I Am Anne Frank (Part 1)" ups the stakes in a major way with some earnest and empathic character development." "Part 2" received a 100% approval rating, based on 11 reviews. The critical consensus reads, "Comparatively light on horror, "I Am Anne Frank (Part 2)" is still full of twists and frights, topped with the return of one hair-raising main character." The Huffington Post Joey DeAngelis stated, "Obviously the first part of "I Am Anne Frank" isn't the finest hour of American Horror Story and didn't really do much to propel the story forward, but damn if it wasn't entertaining." DeAngelis said the second part "hit major high notes, changing the course of the season for the better. It was topped off by a deliciously creepy performance from Zachary Quinto." Amy Amatangelo of Paste called the first part "the strongest [episode] of the season" and stated, "The series stayed away from schlocky clichés in favor of deeper character development and a compelling guest star." However, Amatangelo thought the second part was "incredibly misogynistic", adding, "What separates American Horror Story from an episode of Criminal Minds, really? The show appears to be wallowing in torturing women." IGN's Matt Fowler stated, ""I Am Anne Frank (Part 2)" was a killer episode filled with the right amount of twists and frights, capped off by a perfectly creepy turn by Zachary Quinto." ==References== ==External links== * * "I Am Anne Frank, Part 1" at TV Guide.com * * "I Am Anne Frank, Part 2" at TV Guide.com Category:2012 American television episodes Category:American Horror Story: Asylum episodes Category:Cultural depictions of Anne Frank Category:Incest in television Category:Patricide in fiction Category:Television episodes directed by Michael Uppendahl Category:Television episodes written by Brad Falchuk

3783637	I Am Kurious Oranj	I Am Kurious Oranj is the eleventh studio album by English post-punk band the Fall. It was released on 24 October 1988 through record label Beggars Banquet. The album's release came at the end of a relatively successful year for the group, which had also seen the release of an "accessible" album, The Frenz Experiment, and a handful of singles in the UK charts. However, there was internal strife within the band; Mark E. Smith was increasingly dependent on alcohol and speed, and his marriage to Fall lead guitarist, songwriter and vocalist Brix Smith was coming to an end. Although she wrote many of the most acclaimed songs on the album, including "Overture From Kurious Oranj", "Van Plague?" and "Bad News Girl", she was excluded from the writing and publishing credits. I Am Kurious Oranj was intended as the soundtrack for the ballet I Am Curious, Orange, a collaboration with the dancer Michael Clark. The music was mostly pre-written by Brix Smith and bassist Steve Hanley. A live version was recorded during an Edinburgh Festival performance of the ballet, and issued in 2000 as I Am as Pure as Oranj. == Background == I Am Kurious Oranj was intended as the soundtrack for the ballet I Am Curious, Orange, produced by contemporary dance group Michael Clark & Company, and loosely based on the 300th anniversary of William of Orange's ascension to the English throne. The album combines studio recordings with tracks recorded live during performances in Edinburgh in August 1988. The opening track "New Big Prinz" (as well as its alternative version, "Big New Priest") is based on "Hip Priest" from the group's 1982 album Hex Enduction Hour; the original track was also used in the ballet as a backing tape. "Jerusalem" is an adaptation of William Blake's hymn using Hubert Parry's original music (although Parry does not appear in the credits). "Last Nacht" is a remix of "Bremen Nacht" from the group's previous album, The Frenz Experiment. "Dead Beat Descendant" was written for the ballet and performed live, but did not make the album. It was later re-recorded and released as a track on the Seminal Live compilation. I Am Kurious Oranj's title is derived from Swedish director Vilgot Sjöman's films I Am Curious (Yellow) (1967) and I Am Curious (Blue) (1968). It appears as I Am Kurious, Oranj on some packaging formats. == Critical reception == I Am Kurious Oranj was critically well received at the time. NME wrote "[The Fall have] retained the power to surprise, to provoke and occasionally outrage that only The Smiths could pretend to possess in the '80s." A later review of the album by AllMusic, however, is more indifferent, opining, "As a cohesive Fall album it fails [...] I Am Kurious Oranj would have been more interesting to see than hear." == Track listing == As with other Fall albums released through Beggars Banquet Records, I Am Kurious Oranj featured a different track listing across the various formats on which it was originally released. In addition to extra tracks "Guide Me Soft" and "Big New Priest", the UK CD featured several alternative and extended versions of songs (tracks 3, 5, 7, 8 and 12). In 2013, Beggars remastered and reissued the album on CD as a part of the 5 Albums box set; the new edition used the CD mixes sequenced according to the vinyl track order, with extra tracks and alternate vinyl mixes added as bonus tracks. ===Original UK CD/cassette version=== *The CD versions of tracks 3, 5, 6 and 7 are live versions from performances of the I Am Curious, Orange ballet at King's Theatre, Edinburgh in August 1988. : Note: "Van Plague?" is listed as "Van Plague" on the cassette edition. ===Vinyl version (also original US CD/cassette version)=== : Note: "New Big Prinz" is misspelled as "New Big Prize" on the record label. ===2013 CD (5 Albums box set)=== == Personnel == ; The Fall * Mark E.

37893387	I Can't Live Without You	"I Can't Live Without You" is a song by the Liechtenstein producer Al Walser. The song was nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 2013 Grammy Awards. It lost to "Bangarang" by Skrillex & Sirah. == Reception == The song's nomination for a Grammy Award caused controversy. Philip Sherburne of Spin noted a lack of notability of Walser compared to Avicii, Calvin Harris, Skrillex and Swedish House Mafia, also nominated for the award, writing that the song's "clunky rock/trance fusion and low-budget video make Rebecca Black's 'Friday' sound and look cutting-edge in comparison". Bill Freimuth, the vice president of the Recording Academy - which is responsible for the Grammy Awards - told MTV that Walser "was a very active marketer of his work, and got his music out to lots and lots of our voting membership, and they chose to vote for it". He noted that the ballot is audited by Deloitte and said that "they found nothing really anomalous or wrong with the votes surrounding this nomination". Speculation surrounding the nomination includes Walser's membership of the Recording Academy. Walser stated his position as a voter "was only helpful to the extent that I had access to the other voters, and they could see what I was doing on a regular basis". Billboard compared the incident to Linda Chorney, who gained a Grammy Award nomination the previous year through a similar tactic. == Track listing == ; Digital download # "I Can't Live Without You" (Maui & Chris Mix) - 3:19 # "I Can't Live Without You" (Malibu Mix) - 3:15 # "I Can't Live Without You" (Turnyboy Mix) - 3:29 == References == == External links == * Category:2012 singles Category:2012 songs Category:Eurodance songs
37906536	I Am That	I Am That is a compilation of talks on Shiva Advaita (Nondualism) philosophy by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, a Hindu spiritual teacher who lived in Mumbai.About Nisargadatta Maharaj The English translation of the book from the original Marathi recordings was done by Maurice Frydman, edited by Sudhakar S. Dixit and first published in 1973 by Chetana Publications.Chetana Publications. The book was revised and reedited in July 1981. These publications led to the spread of Nisargadatta's teachings to the West, especially North America and Europe. Excerpts of the book were published in Yoga Journal in September 1981, the month Nisargadatta died at age 84. The book is considered the author's masterpiece and a spiritual classic by authors and teachers like Eckhart Tolle,Eckhart Tolle on Nisargadatta Maharaj (video) Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra Peter Crone and Adyashanti, who called the book a "standout" and "the clearest expression I've ever found." Dyer calls Nisargadatta his teacher, and cites the quotation, "Love says: 'I am everything'. Wisdom says: 'I am nothing'. Between the two my life flows." That quotation has also been cited by several other authors in diverse fields, from wellness to cooking. Joseph Goldstein visited Nisargadatta in January 1980 after reading the book, and after several meetings said, "The path that Nisargadatta revealed was not a search, but a find, not a struggle, but an abiding, not a cultivation, but something intrinsic to all". I Am That has been translated into several languages, including Dutch, Italian and Hebrew. ==Background and publication history== thumb|Nisargadatta Maharaj (1897 – 1981) Nisargadatta Maharaj met his guru, Siddharameshwar Maharaj, in 1933. Siddharameshwar died two and half years later, and Nisargadatta continued to practice what his guru had taught him while running a small shop in Khetwadi locality in Girgaon, Mumbai. In 1951, after receiving an inner revelation from his guru, he began to give initiations. He allowed devotees to gather twice a day for satsang, with meditation, bhajan-singing, and the answering of questions, continuing until his death on 8 September 1981, at the age of 84. Maurice Frydman, a Jewish refugee from Warsaw, came to India in the late 1930s. Initially, he worked at the State Government Electric Factory in Bangalore. Later, influenced by Mahatma Gandhi, he worked in Aundh State (the present Satara district) on the Aundh Experiment for local self- governance.Alter, Joseph S. Gandhi's Body. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000. . p. 92. Thereafter he took sannyas (renunciation). He was associated with Sri Ramana Maharshi and J. Krishnamurti. Eventually he became a disciple of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj in the early days of Nisargadatta's spiritual work in 1965. Frydman spoke Marathi and so became a translator of Nisargadatta's talks. He recorded and compiled the sessions, leading to the publication of I Am That. Most of the conversations were in Marathi, but for the benefit of Westerners talks were often translated. Frydman: ″Whenever I was present the task would fall to me. Many of the questions put and answers given were so interesting and significant that a tape-recorder was brought in. While most of the tapes were of the regular Marathi-English variety, some were polyglot scrambles of several Indian and European languages. Later, each tape was deciphered and translated into English″ .I Am That, Translator´s note All the conversations were recorded at Nisargadatta's small tenement and later transcribed and translated by Frydman while the master was still unknown to the Western public. A Marathi version of the talks, verified by Nisargadatta, was published separately. According to Nisargadatta, "Maurice (Frydman) told me, 'Everything that is said here is immediately lost, though it could be of a great benefit for those looking for truth. I would like to translate and publish your words so others might know them. And so, he wrote I Am That".Yoga en Zaragoza, Estudios tradicionales With the book's publication, Nisargadatta became very popular: hundreds of foreigners started flocking to his small tenement, and Nisargadatta once remarked: ″I used to have a quiet life but the book I Am That by Maurice has turned my house into a railway station platform.″ I Am That was initially rejected by the major publishers, so Frydman worked with a then small publisher, Chetana Publications. The book was first published in 1973 in two hardcover volumes. The revised and enlarged second edition was published in one volume in 1976. The first paperback was published in 1984. The book is now published in the USA and Canada by The Acorn Press. ==Structure== The book comprises 101 sections, each corresponding to a particular conversation, averaging four pages each and cast in a question-and-answer format. Most deal with a single issue but some go from one subject to other, always in line with the spiritual quest. The second edition includes an epilogue, Nisarga Yoga, by Maurice Frydman. ==Style of teaching in I Am That== thumb|180px|right|Nisargadatta's "I Am That" in English. 180px|thumb|Hindi edition of the book. Nisargadatta's teachings are grounded in the Advaita Vedanta interpretation of the Advaita idea Tat Tvam Asi, literally "That Thou Art", (Tat = "Absolute", Tvam = "You", Asi = "are") meaning "You are (actually) Absolute" (who think otherwise). Nisargadatta also had a strong devotion to his own guru, and suggested the path of devotion, Bhakti yoga, to some of his visitors. Nisargadatta deviated from the formal Navnath Sampradaya lineage style of teaching by giving informal discourses for the benefit of Western devotees who did not have access to Dasbodh or other texts, and who were not familiar with Indian traditions and customs. It has been said that Nisargadatta´s style was direct, and even at times aggressive. He very rarely mentioned scriptures or quoted spiritual books. His teachings came from his own experience. == Nisarga Yoga == Nisargadatta taught what has been called Nisarga Yoga (Nisarga can be translated as “the natural state”). In I Am That, Nisarga Yoga is defined as living life with “harmlessness,” “friendliness,” and “interest,” abiding in “spontaneous awareness” while being “conscious of effortless living.” The practice of this form of Yoga involves meditating on one’s sense of "I am" or "being" with the aim of reaching its ultimate source, which Nisargadatta called the Self. _The Seven Principles of Nisarga Yoga (As identified by Nic Higham, 2018)_ # Non-identification and right understanding # Interest and earnestness # Spontaneity and effortlessness # Attentiveness to being # Right action # Going within to go beyond # Awareness of Self ==See also== *Samarth Ramdas *Advaita vedanta *Navnath Sampradaya *Siddharameshwar Maharaj ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * ==External links== * I AM THAT - By Nisargadatta Maharaj * nisargadatta.net * Farsi Translation of the book Category:Nondualism Category:Advaita Vedanta texts Category:1973 non-fiction books Category:Indian non-fiction books Category:20th-century Indian books Category:Hinduism studies books Category:Books about spirituality Category:Advaita Vedanta Category:English-language books

I Am a Man is a declaration of civil rights, often used as a personal statement and as a declaration of independence against oppression. =="Am I not a man?"== Historically, in countries such as the United States and South Africa, the term "boy" was used as a pejorative racist insult towards men of color and slaves, indicating their subservient social status of being less than men. In response, "Am I not a man and a brother?" became a catchphrase used by British and American abolitionists. In 1787, Josiah Wedgwood designed the Wedgwood anti-slavery medallion. He copied the original design from the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade as a cameo in black and white. It was widely reproduced and became a popular fashion statement promoting justice, humanity, and freedom. The question "Am I not a man?" was brought up again during the Dred Scott decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1857.Am I Not a Man? by Mark L. Shurtleff. Reviewed by Robert Fleming. AALBC. During the Civil Rights Movement at the Memphis sanitation strike in 1968, "I Am a Man!" signs were used to answer the same question.

3806487	I Corps (Australia)	I Corps was an Australian Army corps, one of three that were raised by the Army during World War II. It was the main Australian operational corps for much of the war. Various Australian and other Allied divisions came under its control at different times. In 1940–1942, the corps was based in the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern theatres, and controlled forces in action against the Germans, Italians and later the Vichy French in North Africa, Greece and Syria–Lebanon. In 1942, following Japan's entry into the war, I Corps was transferred to the South West Pacific Area. Forces assigned to the corps undertook garrison duties in Ceylon, and briefly deployed to the ill- fated defence of Java in 1942, before returning to Australia. Between late 1942 and 1945, the corps oversaw Allied frontline units fighting against the Japanese in New Guinea and then Borneo in 1945. ==History== ===Formation=== At the outbreak of the Second World War, the Australian government decided to raise the Second Australian Imperial Force, an all volunteer force for overseas service that was separate to the previously existing part-time Militia. Initially, this force consisted of a single division – the 6th Infantry Division – as well as some base and support troops. On 25 February 1940, the decision was made to expand the 2nd AIF to a corps, consisting of two infantry divisions – the 6th and 7th – and throughout March and into April work began to start forming the new units, and establish a corps headquarters, in Melbourne. This formation would be responsible for the AIF units forming in Australia. On 11 April 1940, the establishment of I Corps was gazetted, and by the middle of the month the headquarters' strength was reported as 12 officers and 45 other ranks. Lieutenant General Thomas Blamey was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC). In late May 1940, approval was provided for the 2nd AIF to raise a third division – the 8th – although it would ultimately not serve with I Corps. Preparations also commenced for I Corps headquarters personnel to begin moving overseas. A small rear corps headquarters was to remain in Australia, although the responsibility for command of troops in Australia would be devolved to the 7th Division until it also deployed. The initial deployment of staff began in May, but the majority of draft made it only as far as Fremantle, Western Australia, before disembarking and returning to Melbourne, when the decision was made to divert this convoy to the United Kingdom, rather than the main corps-area in the Middle East. The personnel who reached the UK were subsequently used to form HQ Australforce. Meanwhile, the main element of the corps headquarters, including Blamey, reached Palestine in mid-June 1940. They arrived amidst fighting in the Western Desert, and it was considered that the AIF troops could soon be committed to battle. ===Mediterranean and Middle Eastern theatres=== thumb|Australian troops enter Bardia, January 1941 Initially, when I Corps headquarters arrived there was only one Australian infantry division in the Middle East – the 6th, which was completing its training – however between October and December the 7th arrived, followed by the 9th by January 1941. During this time, the brigades assigned to each division were shuffled between superior headquarters as a result of several reorganisations to provide the better trained brigades to the formations likely to see combat first. At this time, the main elements of the corps headquarters moved forward towards the combat zone, leaving the administrative staff in Gaza and establishing themselves in Ikingi Maryut, in Egypt. Here they began preparations for operations. The 6th Infantry Division was the first to go into action, capturing Bardia in early January 1941. This was followed by further actions at Tobruk, Derna, Barce, and Benghazi, as the Italians were forced to withdraw across Libya by the Allies. In February, I Corps took over control of Cyrenaica in Libya, replacing the British XIII Corps, and briefly adopting the designation of HQ Cyrenaica Force. This deployment lasted only a month, before I Corps headquarters was withdrawn back to Egypt to prepare for deployment to Greece for the campaign there, which began in April 1941. Initially, it had been planned for the 7th Division to deploy to Greece, but they were not considered fully trained, and as a result the 6th Division was dispatched. In their place, the newly arrived 9th Division replaced the 6th Division in the Western Desert, and they would subsequently take part in the Siege of Tobruk in mid- to late- 1941 when the Axis forces counter-attacked in the Western Desert. Meanwhile, in Greece, the corps controlled the Australian 6th Division, the New Zealand 2nd Division, and the British 1st Armoured Brigade, as well as several ad hoc forces charged with the defence of northern Greece. On 12 April, it was officially renamed the Anzac Corps, a reference to the combined Australian-New Zealand formations of World War I. This was short-lived, though, as the Allied forces in Greece were quickly overcome by the German advance and after withdrawing from Gerania through Elasson, Larissa and Levadia, I Corps HQ left Greece on 23–24 April, and were subsequently evacuated to Egypt, although elements of the 6th Division were landed on Crete where they fought another short and unsuccessful campaign in May. thumb|left|Australian anti-tank gunners resting, soon after their withdrawal from the Vevi area, during the fighting in Greece, April 1941 The corps re-formed in Deir Suneid, in Palestine, during which time the previous I Corps designation was assumed. In June 1941, as part of the initial plan for the invasion of Lebanon and Syria, held by Vichy French forces, I Corps was to take command of operations after Commonwealth forces reached their first objective, the Beirut–Damascus road. However, on 18 June, prior to that objective being reached, I Corps headquarters – based at Nazareth – took charge, to improve command and control of the Allied forces. From this date all Allied troops in the theatre came under the command of Lieutenant General John Lavarack, who took over from Blamey when he became deputy commander-in- chief in the Middle East. The forces under I Corps' command around this time included: 7th Division (less the 18th Infantry Brigade), the British 6th Infantry Division, the 1st (Free French) Light Division and the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade Group. The corps directed operations that captured Damascus and Damour before the armistice took effect on 12 July. Following the armistice in July, I Corps headquarters was established at Aley, near Beirut, and assumed responsibility for occupying all of Lebanon and Syria north of the Beirut–Damascus road. Eventually, the Australian 6th Infantry Division arrived to relieve the British 6th. ===Pacific area=== ==== Java, Ceylon, and home defence==== Following the outbreak of the Pacific War, I Corps headquarters, along with the 6th and 7th Divisions, were released from service in the Middle East to meet the threat posed by the Japanese advance through the Pacific. The divisions departed Egypt by sea in several convoys between January and March 1942. The 9th Division would remain in the Middle East, though, upon request, and would see further action in the First and Second Battles of El Alamein, where they would be assigned to the British XXX Corps. As the situation in the Pacific grew desperate for the Allies, plans were made to deploy I Corps headquarters, and the 6th and 7th Divisions, to Sumatra, Java, or possibly to Burma to help stem the tide of the Japanese advance on Rangoon. An advanced party, including the corps commander, Lavarack, flew to Java ahead of the landing and advised against deploying the force there, advising that they should be sent to Burma instead. The Australian government ultimately rejected the request to divert the 7th Division to Rangoon, and although most of the force returned to Australia, Lavarack was not able to prevent some elements from landing in Java – mainly the troops on the transport Orcades consisting of a machine gun battalion (the 2/3rd) and a pioneer battalion (the 2/2nd), as well as engineers, transport and medical personnel, who became part of Blackforce under Brigadier Arthur Blackburn. This force fought briefly alongside US and Dutch forces before being overwhelmed and taken into captivity. thumb|Troops from the 7th Infantry Division disembarking in Adelaide, March 1942 I Corps HQ was subsequently relocated to Australia, reaching Adelaide in March 1942 and then moving to Melbourne. The 7th Division deployed to northern New South Wales, while the 6th Division (less the 19th Infantry Brigade which was sent to garrison Darwin) was detached to Ceylon to provide a garrison to defend against a possible Japanese invasion. The invasion did not eventuate, and the Australians remained on the island until July 1942, and finally reached Australia the following month. While the 16th and 17th Brigades were in Ceylon, the Army in Australia had undergone a significant reorganisation to meet the threat of a possible Japanese invasion. In April 1942, I Corps headquarters was used to raise an army level formation, the First Army, and a new I Corps headquarters was raised from Headquarters Southern Command (previously the 3rd Military District. I Corps came under the command of Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell around this time. Assigned to the defence of southern Queensland, the new I Corps moved to Esk, Queensland, where it became part of the First Army and commanded troops in northern New South Wales and Queensland, including the 25th Infantry Brigade, the Brisbane Covering Force, the 7th Infantry Brigade, the 1st Motor Brigade and the remainder of the 7th Division, which was held back in reserve around Glen Innes, New South Wales. In this assignment, it joined II Corps, one of the two other corps (the other being III Corps) raised at this time. In May 1942, the corps was bolstered with the remainder of the 3rd Infantry Division, although they were transferred to II Corps in July, and moved further north, and were replaced within I Corps by the US 32nd Infantry Division. ====New Guinea==== As the fighting in New Guinea intensified and the Japanese advanced beyond Kokoda, plans were made to reinforce the troops along the Kokoda Track. As a result, in August 1942, I Corps headquarters deployed to Port Moresby where they took over from the existing headquarters New Guinea Force, becoming Headquarters I Corps & New Guinea Force, although for all intents and purposes it was referred to as New Guinea Force. The formation subsequently commanded the troops around Milne Bay, which subsequently repulsed a Japanese landing, as well as the 7th Division troops deploying along the Track, the 6th Division troops around Port Moresby, and Kanga Force around Wau. In late September, following the withdrawal from Ioribaiwa Blamey decided to replace Rowell as corps commander with Lieutenant General Edmund Herring, who had previously commanded II Corps. In October and November, the Japanese began to withdraw and the Australians – with elements from both the 6th and 7th Divisions – undertook counter-offensive that saw them reoccupy Kokoda, and then advance north towards the Japanese beachheads around Buna and Gona. These beachheads were eventually captured in December 1942 and January 1943 by Australian and US forces from the 7th and 32nd Infantry Divisions, after heavy fighting. During this time, between November 1942 and January 1943, New Guinea Force deployed an advanced headquarters forward to control the fighting. thumb|left|Australian troops disembarking from American Landing Ships, during the operation to capture Lae, September 1943 Following the capture of northern Papua, New Guinea Force was reorganised, and new formations began arriving. Meanwhile, throughout the first half of 1943, Australian operations focused upon the capture of Salamaua, which saw a series of battles aimed at securing Salamaua prior to the drive on Lae. In August 1943, a new I Corps headquarters was raised from the New Guinea Force headquarters staff, and the corps headquarters established itself at Dobdura, where it was assigned to New Guinea Force as an army-level headquarters. Assigned the role of capturing Lae, I Corps was provided with the 7th Infantry Division, which in early September 1943 was flown in to Nadzab and attacked overland from there and the 9th Infantry Division, which carried out and amphibious landing to the east of Lae, before assaulting along the coast. Lae was captured more quickly than had been expected, and later in the month, this was followed up by elements of the 9th Division which carried out a landing at Scarlet Beach, as part of operations to secure the Huon Peninsula, while the 7th Division began operations to secure the Markham and Ramu Valleys. The following month, however, I Corps headquarters was relieved by II Corps, as its personnel were in need of rest, and they subsequently returned to Australia. II Corps and New Guinea Force would subsequently command the conclusion of the operations commenced by I Corps, culminating in the capture of Madang in April 1944. Meanwhile, in Australia, I Corps headquarters was re-established at Barrine, Queensland, where it took command of units resting and training prior to their commitment for further operations. At this time, the corps was assigned the 3rd and 6th Infantry Divisions, based at Kairi and Wondecla respectively. In early 1944, the corps was also assigned the 9th Infantry Division, at Ravenshoe, following its return from New Guinea for rest. In February 1944, Herring retired and command of I Corps temporarily passed to Lieutenant General Stanley Savige. In April 1944, I Corps headquarters provided individual staff reinforcements for the II Corps headquarters, although there was no name change at this time, and I Corps remained in Australia in order to command the 2nd AIF divisions, while II Corps took over the deployed Militia divisions: the 3rd, 5th and 11th. As a result, Lieutenant General Frank Berryman assumed command of I Corps. In line with this, the 7th Infantry Division was transferred to I Corps at this time as they returned from New Guinea for rest, although they were based further south than the other elements, around Strathpine. Meanwhile, the 3rd Infantry Division re-deployed to New Guinea, and the 7th Infantry Division moved to Kairi, to concentrate nearer to the other I Corps formations. ====Borneo==== Throughout 1944, plans were made for I Corps to be used in the Philippines and Ambon, but ultimately these were not acted upon as the role of Australian forces in the Pacific diminished and as US forces gained the ascendency. By October 1944, Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead had assumed command of the corps. Finally, it was decided that the force would be committed to the operation to re-take Borneo in mid-1945, in order to secure important air and naval bases to allow further operations elsewhere in Borneo and then later Java. thumb|Members of the 7th Division at Balikpapan For the operation, the corps was placed directly under General Douglas MacArthur's command, rather than being assigned to the US Eighth Army. Advanced elements of I Corps headquarters subsequently moved to Morotai Island in March 1945, followed by the remainder of the headquarters the following month. From there, they directed a series of amphibious landings that were carried out by the 7th and 9th Divisions at Tarakan, North Borneo and Balikpapan through May, June and July. In all locations, the objectives were captured, albeit against stronger-than-expected resistance in some cases, with commensurately heavy casualties, after which the Australians pushed further inland, carrying out mopping up operations. On Tarakan, the airfield was captured five days after the landing, but it was badly damaged and ultimately filled no role in subsequent operations. Meanwhile, in North Borneo, after operations to secure Labuan and Brunei had proved successful, a follow up landing was made around Weston, with a subsequent advance towards Beaufort, which was captured after heavy engagement resulted in over 100 Japanese killed. By mid-July, the main resistance around Balkipapan and the coastal areas had been overcome, and the defending Japanese had withdrawn into the hills further inland. Following the cessation of hostilities in August, the corps assumed responsibility for facilitating the Japanese surrender on Borneo and in making preparations for returning the area to Dutch colonial control in the post war period. This included undertaking local and protective patrols to maintain law and order and to secure Japanese soldiers who had not yet surrendered. As part of the demobilisation process, I Corps headquarters closed on 15 September 1945, at which time its constituent divisions were transferred to the direct command of Advanced Land Headquarters. In the post war period, no corps-level formations have been raised by the Australian Army. ==Subordinate formations== In early 1941, when I Corps commenced operations in the Middle East, it consisted of the following formations: * 6th Infantry Division (16th, 17th and 19th Infantry Brigades) * 7th Infantry Division (18th, 21st and 25th Infantry Brigades) * 9th Infantry Division (20th, 24th and 26th Infantry Brigades) In July – September 1943, I Corps consisted of the following formations: * 5th Infantry Division (15th, 17th, 29th Infantry Brigades, US 162nd Infantry Regiment) * 7th Infantry Division (18th, 21st, 25th Infantry Brigades, US 503rd Parachute Regiment * 9th Infantry Division (20th, 24th and 26th Infantry Brigades) * 11th Infantry Division (6th Infantry Brigade) * 4th Infantry Brigade In the final stages of World War II, I Corps consisted of the following units: * 6th Infantry Division * 7th Infantry Division * 9th Infantry Division Additionally, a number of Royal Australian Artillery units were attached to I Corps at various times. In many cases these artillery units were attached temporarily to HQ RAA 1st Australian Corps for training, reorganisation and re-equipping before deployment on active service under the command of other formations, principally the 3rd, 6th, 7th or 9th Australian Infantry Divisions. ==Commanders== The following officers served as commander of I Corps: *1940–1941: Lieutenant General Thomas Blamey *1941–1942: Lieutenant General John Lavarack *1942: Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell *1942–1944: Lieutenant General Edmund Herring *1944: Lieutenant General Stanley Savige *1944: Lieutenant General Frank Berryman *1944–1945: Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 1 1 1 1 1 1

Merle points out it is too late for that; The Governor has had enough time to block all possible escape routes. Moreover, The Governor can besiege the prison and starve them out. Rick and Glenn, however, argue that the group should stay, even though they don't have enough ammunition to clear out the walkers. Rick begins to walk away causing Hershel to challenge him to get his head clear so that he can lead them. Even Carl sees his father would benefit from some rest, and suggests that he let Hershel and Daryl take charge. The Governor is readying Woodbury for total war. Civilians, including adolescents and disabled citizens, are given weapons and taught to use them, in preparation for combat. Andrea is disturbed by this and asks to leave to negotiate a peace with the prison, but The Governor discourages her, implying that she will not be welcomed back if she leaves. Andrea asks Milton to help her sneak out, which Milton reports back to The Governor (as per his assignment to "keep tabs on her"). The Governor tells Milton to help her. In the woods, Milton helps Andrea capture and disable a walker, hacking off its arms, breaking its jaws, and tethering it, imitating Michonne. While they are doing so, Tyreese's group comes upon them and kills several approaching walkers. Milton agrees to take Tyreese's group back to Woodbury, while Andrea leaves with her disabled walker for the prison. At the prison, Glenn quietly suggests handing Merle over to The Governor in a desperate hope of appeasing him. Merle, meanwhile, tries to make amends with Michonne for trying to kill her, stating he was only following orders and was not proud of all that that entailed. Andrea's arrival at the prison is met with distrust, especially from Rick, who handles her harshly while searching her for weapons. After catching up on the deaths the group has suffered, she warns them that Woodbury is getting ready for a war and offers to negotiate a truce. Believing that peace is not an option, Rick tells Andrea to help them sneak inside Woodbury for a surprise attack, but she refuses. Michonne later relates her story of how Merle was sent by The Governor to kill her to Andrea, demonstrating that he won't allow anyone to leave or live who isn't under his control. At Woodbury, Tyreese's group has been brought to the infirmary building where they are cleaned up. The Governor gives them his friendly welcome-speech and discusses their ordeals. Allen reveals that they'd been at the prison, where the "crazy" leader, named Rick, chased them out. Tyreese gives The Governor the same offer he'd extended to Rick: to help out and earn their keep. The Governor asks if they could provide a layout of the prison. Allen and Tyreese, wanting admission into Woodbury, gladly agree, while Sasha remains reluctant. While Andrea is visiting Judith, Carol quietly pressures her to assassinate The Governor. The group gives Andrea a car for her return trip to Woodbury, where she is again greeted with an array of weapons pointed at her. She gives The Governor a full report. Back at the prison, Beth begins singing Tom Waits' "Hold On" in order to boost morale. Whilst Beth sings, Rick states that he will be going on a run for weapons. He and Merle also share an antagonizing look. Later, in his bedroom when he is asleep, Andrea brings a knife to The Governor's throat and contemplates killing him but cannot bring herself to do so. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated the episode B on an A to F scale, commenting: "The Walking Dead is good at the most basic mechanism of suspense there is, but there’s more to great storytelling than body counts." Eric Goldman at IGN was more critical, giving the episode a 6.8 out of 10, since the episode was very Andrea-centric, and has disliked the character this season. He did, however, enjoy the return of Tyreese and Carol's plan to kill The Governor. ===Ratings=== The original broadcast, on February 24, 2013, was watched by an estimated 11.01 million viewers, slightly down in viewership from the previous episode. ==References== ==External links== *"I Ain't a Judas" at AMC * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:The Walking Dead (season 3) episodes

With Raul's dream crushed, he was forced to find a new line of work and ended up employed at a small department store called Magic Shop Leon. Raul's life since then has been busy but dull, when one day someone arrives at the store applying for a job. Raul finds out that the new hire is the Demon Lord's child and also happens to be a cute girl. ==Characters== ; : :Raul is a former Hero candidate at the Hero School. He had to find a job after the Demon Lord was defeated and he could not become a Hero. Raul meets the Demon Lord's daughter who is in search of a job, and at first mistakes her for a boy. He is often annoyed by her but at the end of the day is glad that she is around and likes her positive enthusiasm. ; : :Phino is the daughter of the deceased Demon Lord. She lacks common sense due to living in the Demon World and is really carefree. She is very positive and very funny. Phino involuntarily tends to scare off many customers because of her weird way of speaking about violent things when discussing products with them. She might be harboring some feelings for Raul. ; : :Raul's self-proclaimed former rival from Hero School. After she could not become a Hero either, she started working as bunnygirl in the shop that's rivals with Leon shop, but instead lies to Raul about being a security guard. Due to the fact that she always scored top marks in her examinations, Raul usually addresses her as "All A". She likes Raul, but she's tsundere so she denies it when pointed out. ; : :The manager of the magic shop, who is always smiling.

He sometimes mocks Raul to not do anything stupid with his employees. He cares a lot about the shop. ; : :Part of the magic shop's staff, Nova is a cheerful but really clumsy girl.

She works mostly with the deliveries and doing mechanics such as fixing faults, so Lore isn't often seen in the shop.

She also likes Raul, something that is occasionally teased by her coworker and friend Ramdimia. ; : :An employee at Lawson Station like Elza, who's also from the Demon World.

38266949	I Can Take It from There	"I Can Take It from There" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Chris Young. It was released in October 2012 as the fourth and final single from his 2011 album Neon. The song was written by Young, Rhett Akins and Ben Hayslip. ==Critical reception== Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song three and a half stars out of five, writing that "it’s a perfect radio track, but it’s not one of the best three Chris Young songs of all time." Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song a favorable review, saying that "the melody of the opening track to Neon is pretty much stock and trade of most mainstream country studio sessions of the past 10-15 years but that doesn't mean this is a bad song for any song that has Chris Young singing is gonna rise above the pack." Ben Foster of Country Universe gave the song a B+ grade, writing that the song "illustrates how solid song structure and an inspired performance can lift standard country radio fodder from rote to memorable," calling it "a most delicious nugget of catchiness." ==Chart performance== "I Can Take It from There" debuted at number 48 on the U.S. Billboard Country Airplay chart for the week of November 3, 2012. It also debuted at number 48 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of December 1, 2012. It also debuted at number 97 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week of February 23, 2013. It also debuted at number 95 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart for the week of April 6, 2013. It ultimately peaked at number 4 on the Country Airplay chart in April 2013, making it Young's first Top 10 country single to miss the Number One spot.

38299368	I Could Be the One	"I Could Be the One" is a song by Swedish DJ Avicii and Dutch DJ Nicky Romero, which features uncredited vocals from Swedish singer Noonie Bao. The song was written by Avicii, Romero, Bao, Arash Pournouri, Linus Wiklund and Måns Wredenberg, and produced by the former two and Pournouri. The song was released as a digital download in Sweden and the Netherlands on December 26, 2012. It peaked at number three on the Swedish Singles Chart. Internationally, the single topped the charts in Hungary and the United Kingdom, peaked within the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and the Republic of Ireland and the top 20 of the charts in Austria and New Zealand. ==Background and release== Before its official release, the track had been undergoing various name changes. Initially without a title, it was first played by Avicii at the Super Glow event in DC Armory, Washington, USA on November 18, 2011. It was later given the working title "Nicktim", which is a combination of both producers' first names (Nick Rotteveel and Tim Bergling). The instrumental track contained a sample from "D.A.N.C.E." by Justice, which was later removed in the final version. A year later, a vocal version of the track was premiered on November 4, 2012 through Avicii's "LE7ELS" podcast, as well as on Nicky Romero's podcast "Protocol Radio" a week later. After fully mastering the track, they settled on using the track name "I Could Be the One (Nicktim)" while the artists are stated as Avicii vs Nicky Romero. In 2017, the track's vocalist and songwriter Noonie Bao revealed to Spotify that despite working on the track, as well as another one on his 2013 album True, she had never actually met Avicii until a number of years later. ==Critical reception== Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a mixed-to-positive review, stating: > The person in question is Dutch house producer Nicky Romero, a man who is > slightly better acquainted with the current crop of mainstream club poppers, > including Calvin Harris, David Guetta and Bingo Players. As such, "I Could > Be the One" is a battle between Balearic-style EDM and squiggly, chart- > friendly breakdowns that hit all the right places. The result, predictably, > is a peaceful truce. . ==Commercial performance== "I Could Be the One" peaked at number three on the Swedish Singles Chart. The single also saw massive success worldwide, particularly in the United Kingdom, where the single entered at number one on the UK Singles Chart on February 17, 2013 ― for the week ending dated February 23, 2013 ― becoming both Avicii and Nicky Romero's first chart-topping single in Britain. On the UK Dance Chart, "I Could Be the One" debuted at number one ahead of Baauer's "Harlem Shake", which entered the chart at number three. ==Music video== A music video to accompany the release of "I Could Be the One" was first released onto YouTube on December 24, 2012 at a total length of 4 minutes and 46 seconds. It was directed by Peter Huang and won first prize for non-European music video at the Young Director Award 2013 in Cannes. The video stars Inessa FrantowskiAvicii vs Nicky Romero – I Could Be The One (Music Video Review): BlissEnt.com as a woman who works in an office. Simu Liu also appears as one of her coworkers. She clearly hates her job, her morning routine and her colleagues' attitudes. Next, she is seen waking up in a room next to a used condom and a man in bed with her. When she opens the doors in her room, it reveals a balcony with a view of a beautiful beach. She finds a "To-Do List" in the room, with the only 'job' being to "not give a fuck". Then there are several shots of her enjoying herself: walking down a beach destroying a little girl's sandcastle (while giving her the finger), eating a selection of foods in a restaurant before kissing the waiter and dancing in a club with a man before having sex with him on a yacht. She then wakes up in her own apartment, and all is revealed to be a dream. She sees a therapist, who does nothing but prescribes her "more pills". Back in her office, she sits at her desk listening to her colleagues' mundane conversations. Finally, she loses it and begins to wreck the office, throwing her paperwork around, destroying a fax machine, insulting and assaulting some of her colleagues before fleeing the office. Bursting out the office door, the final scene shows her on her phone, booking a one-way ticket to Barbados. As she runs across the road to her car, she is hit by a delivery van which is labelled 2Late. It is unknown whether she survives. ==Track listings== ==Credits and personnel== * Producers – Avicii, Nicky Romero, Ash Pournouri * Lyrics – Linus Wiklund, Noonie Bao, Måns Wredenberg * Vocals – Noonie Bao * Label – Universal Music Group ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2013) scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" Iceland (Tonlist) 26 scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" scope="row" ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2013) Position Australia (ARIA) 36 Austria (Ö3 Austria Top 40) 61 Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) 35 Belgium Dance (Ultratop Flanders) 5 Belgium (Ultratop 50 Wallonia) 37 Belgium Dance (Ultratop Wallonia) 7 France (SNEP) 82 Hungary (Dance Top 40) 9 Hungary (Rádiós Top 40) 41 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 37 Netherlands (Single Top 100) 74 Russia Airplay (TopHit) 19 Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) 7 Ukraine Airplay (TopHit) 139 UK Singles (Official Charts Company) 27 US Dance Club Songs (Billboard) 14 US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) 27 Chart (2014) Position Hungary (Dance Top 40) 90 ==Certifications== ==Release history== Region Date Format Label Italy December 14, 2012 Contemporary hit radio Universal Music Sweden December 26, 2012 Digital download Avicii Music Netherlands United Kingdom February 10, 2013 Universal Music United States March 12, 2013 Contemporary hit radio Sweden March 15, 2013 Digital download Avicii Music Netherlands United Kingdom March 17, 2013 Universal Music United States April 15, 2013 Digital download Avicii Music ==See also== * List of number-one dance singles of 2013 (U.S.) ==References== Category:2012 singles Category:2012 songs Category:Avicii songs Category:Nicky Romero songs Category:Universal Music Group singles Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Number-one singles in Poland Category:Number-one singles in Scotland Category:Song recordings produced by Avicii Category:Songs written by Nicky Romero Category:Songs written by Arash Pournouri Category:Songs written by Noonie Bao Category:Songs written by Linus Wiklund Category:Songs written by Avicii
38302282	I Can Eat Glass	I Can Eat Glass was a linguistic project documented on the early Web by then- Harvard student Ethan Mollick. The objective was to provide speakers with translations of the phrase "I can eat glass, it does not hurt me" from a wide variety of languages; the phrase was chosen because of its unorthodox nature. Mollick's original page disappeared in or about June 2004. As Mollick explained, visitors to a foreign country have "an irresistible urge" to say something in that language, and whatever they say (a cited example being along the lines of "Where is the bathroom?") usually marks them as tourists immediately. Saying "I can eat glass, it does not hurt me", however, ensures that the speaker "will be viewed as an insane native, and treated with dignity and respect". The project grew to considerable size since web surfers were invited to submit translations. The phrase was translated into over 150 languages, including some that are fictional or invented, as well as into code from various computer languages. It became an Internet meme. ==References== ==External links== *Web Archive copy of I Can Eat Glass *I Can Eat Glass, Harvard Immediate Gratification Players *I Can Eat Glass in UTF-8, with notes by Frank da Cruz, Columbia University Category:Internet memes Category:Translation

38440878	I Can't Even Touch You	"I Can't Even Touch You" is a song by the British singer-songwriter Steve Harley, which was released in 1982 as a non-album single under his band's name Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel. The song was written by Harley and produced by Midge Ure. ==Background== "I Can't Even Touch You" was Harley's first release of new material since his 1979 album The Candidate. The song was first introduced live during Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel's 1981 Christmas tour, where Harley also featured two other new tracks, "Don't Shoot, Till You See The Whites Of Their Eyes" (a.k.a. "The Race Game") and "Not From Her World" (a cover of a 4 Out of 5 Doctors song). The recording and subsequent release of "I Can't Even Touch You" as a single came to fruition after Harley made a deal with Chris Wright, the founder and chairman of Chrysalis Records. The pair had met at the Sandown Park Racecourse, and as a result of a conversation there, Harley sent Wright the song's demo recording. Showing interest in the song, Wright then suggested that Midge Ure produce it. The song was soon recorded with Ure in the producer's chair. In the studio, Alan Darby, Cockney Rebel's guitarist of the time, laid down the original eight-to-the-bar chugging rhythm part of the track. Ure thought Darby's contribution was slightly off-beat at times and therefore re-did the part himself. Darby played the lead guitar parts on the track. The piano and keyboards on the song were performed by Andy Qunta, later of Icehouse fame, who joined Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel in late 1981. Speaking to the Evening Express in March 1982, Harley said, "The only reason I haven't made records since The Candidate is that I have had nothing of merit to say. Who does, come to that, in rock 'n' roll? But I thought I'd wait until I met the right people to manage me, the right record company to record me and the right frame of mind to carry me through." "I Can't Even Touch You" was released in March 1982, but failed to make an appearance in the UK Singles Chart. It did, however, reach number 132 on the Record Business Bubbling Under Singles chart on 5 April. It dropped to number 137 the following week and number 144 the week after that. Both Chrysalis and fans of Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel had believed at the time that the song would become a hit. It was Harley's only release that year and his only through Chrysalis. Although not released in North America, the song gained some airplay on the Toronto rock radio station CFNY-FM in April–May 1982. In 1985, Harley recalled of the song's lack of commercial success, "Midge and I always talk about that [song]. We were both very disappointed [that it wasn't a hit]." Harley and Ure worked together again in circa 1984 on another Harley solo track, but the song has never been released. Harley also gave Ure some lyrics for potential use on his first solo album, but they were not used. ==Release== "I Can't Even Touch You" was released by Chrysalis Records on 7-inch vinyl in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. The B-side, "I Can Be Anyone", was also written by Harley and produced by Ure. The track has remained exclusive to the single and has not appeared on any other release. "I Can Be Anyone" was first introduced live during Cockney Rebel's 1980 Christmas tour, along with two other new songs, "My Cold Heart" and "Such is Life". The single was released with a full colour picture sleeve, featuring a photograph of Harley. Shortly after its release, "I Can't Even Touch You" and its B-side were the first tracks to be acquired by music publishers Star Street Music Ltd, which was established in 1982 by Eric Hall as a joint venture company with EMI Music Publishing. Following its release as a single, the song would later appear on three Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel compilations: 1999's The Cream of Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel, 2006's The Cockney Rebel – A Steve Harley Anthology and 2008's The Best of Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel. It also appeared as a bonus track on the 2000 CD release of Harley's 1979 album The Candidate. ==Promotion== A full-page black-and-white advert was included in the 27 March 1982 issue of Melody Maker and a smaller advert included in the 1 April 1982 issue of Smash Hits to promote the release of the new single. The song has been performed live on a number of occasions. It was performed at Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel's 1984 concert at the Camden Palace, London, which was filmed for TV and released on the VHS Live from London in 1985. When the band returned to touring in 1989, the song was occasionally included in the set-list. Around 2004, the song was again reintroduced for a brief time, and was performed live at Glastonbury Festival in 2005. ==Critical reception== On its release, Tim de Lisle of Smash Hits commented in a review of the single, "Produced, like Visage, by the tireless Midge Ure but beyond that there's not much else to be said for it. Pleasant, colourless and a far cry from his hits of the 70s." Sunie Fletcher of Record Mirror wrote, "Laidback rock music for (ahem) mature tastes, I suppose. Not mine, certainly, but the tune is very pretty and it's all very tasteful and that." Julie Burchill of New Musical Express stated, "An insipid Cockney encore for those wonderful swollen vowels you'll remember forever and all- round tortured mediocrity. Music not to give up your day-job to. Mr Harley was led back from the wilderness by M. Ure of Samaritans Inc." Brian Aitken of the Evening Express wrote, "'I Can't Even Touch You' may not be top ten material but it contains enough evidence to suggest that a fresh Steve Harley is ready for stardom again." Simon Mares of the Reading Evening Post commented, "After years in the wilderness, Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel return with a Midge Ure-produced song which has Steve sounding very like Bowie. In the unreleased 1991 book The Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel Story, author Hans Peters described the song as "a surrealistic love song". In a review of the band's performance at the 2005 Glastonbury Festival, eFestivals writer Karen Morrison said: "...'When the Halo Slips' and 'I Can't Even Touch You' follow with their full on keyboards and the applause is deafening." ==Track listing== 7-inch single #"I Can't Even Touch You" – 4:04 #"I Can Be Anyone" – 3:20 ==Personnel== * Steve Harley – vocals * Midge Ure – producer, rhythm guitar * Alan Darby – lead guitar * Andy Qunta – piano, keyboards ==Charts== Chart (1982) Peak position UK Record Business Bubbling Under Singles 101-150 132 ==References== Category:1982 songs Category:1982 singles Category:Chrysalis Records singles Category:Steve Harley songs Category:Songs written by Steve Harley

38866496	I Am Missing You	"I Am Missing You" is a song by Indian musician Ravi Shankar, sung by his sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar and released as the lead single from his 1974 album Shankar Family & Friends. The song is a rare Shankar composition in the Western pop genre, with English lyrics, and was written as a love song to the Hindu god Krishna. The recording was produced and arranged by George Harrison, in a style similar to Phil Spector's signature sound, and it was the first single issued on Harrison's Dark Horse record label. Other contributing musicians include Tom Scott, Nicky Hopkins, Billy Preston, Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner. A second version appears on Shankar Family & Friends, titled "I Am Missing You (Reprise)", featuring an arrangement closer to a folk ballad. Shankar and Harrison performed "I Am Missing You" throughout their North American tour in November–December 1974. As a forerunner to the 1980s world music genre, these live performances of the song brought together Shankar's orchestra of distinguished Indian classical musicians – among them, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Shivkumar Sharma, Alla Rakha, T.V. Gopalkrishnan, L. Subramaniam and Sultan Khan – and Harrison's band of top rock, jazz and funk players. The Harrison-arranged studio version of "I Am Missing You" appeared on Shankar's career-spanning box set Ravi Shankar: In Celebration, released in 1996. Shankar reinterpreted "I Am Missing You" for his 2005 project Jazzmin, featuring Californian jazz musicians and his daughter Anoushka on sitar. ==Background and composition== Having trained formally in the Hindustani classical idiom and performed as a sitarist since the 1940s,Shankar, My Music, My Life, pp. 83–86.Ken Hunt, "Ravi Shankar: Biography", AllMusic (retrieved 24 October 2013). Ravi Shankar wrote his first Western pop composition, "I Am Missing You", in the early 1970s. Although known primarily as an instrumentalist in the West through his interpretation of Indian ragas,World Music: The Rough Guide, pp. 70–71. Shankar's previous work in the vocal tradition had included ballet productions for the Indian National TheatreLavezzoli, p. 54. and the Triveni Kala Sangam.Shankar, My Music, My Life, p. 98. More recently, he had recorded two short vocal pieces on his 1971 EP Joi Bangla,Lavezzoli, p. 190. released as a benefit disc for refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War.Spizer, p. 341.Leng, pp. 111, 112. Shankar later recalled of the moment he composed "I Am Missing You": "I don't know how I did it, but one day I wrote an English song without thinking …"Book accompanying Ravi Shankar–George Harrison, Collaborations box set (Dark Horse Records, 2010; produced by Olivia Harrison), p. 19. He played the composition to his friend, ex-Beatle George Harrison, who liked it immediately. Harrison told British DJ Nicky Horne in August 1974:Madinger & Easter, p. 442. "It just blew my mind, because I heard it from my pop background. I said [to him], 'That's a hit … It's a lovely song – you should write more of these, Ravi.' And he said, 'Oh, you know, I've been trying not to write these for years.'""At the Starting Gate", Contra Band Music, 21 August 2012 (retrieved 22 October 2013). Often referred to with the accompanying parenthetical title "(Krishna, Where Are You?)", "I Am Missing You" is a love song dedicated to the Hindu god Krishna.Lavezzoli, p. 195. In the choruses, Shankar's words mourn the apparent absence of Krishna from his life, but in the repeated verses he acknowledges: "Though I can't see you / I hear your flute all the while."Lyric sheet, Shankar Family & Friends CD (Dark Horse Records, 2010; produced by George Harrison). The latter line reflects the importance of the flute – or bansuri – in the Hindu tradition,Tillery, p. 67. since it is the musical instrument most commonly associated with the deity.Leng, p. 157fn.Lavezzoli, p. 33. In his second autobiography, Raga Mala (1997), Shankar describes the words as "a simple lyric that just gushed out of me when I was travelling on a plane".Shankar, Raga Mala, p. 222. Speaking to journalist Graham Reid in 1998, Shankar recalled: "I think we were travelling somewhere in the States … it was very short, maybe six or eight lines. It came very spontaneously with the tune and I noted it down."Graham Reid, "Ravi Shankar Interviewed (1998): In the house of the master", Elsewhere, 18 August 2013 (retrieved 13 August 2014). In addition to the lyrics being in English rather than Hindi or Bengali, the latter being Shankar's first language,Shankar, My Music, My Life, pp. 70, 77. the song's melody follows Western convention,Clayson, p. 339. with distinct chord changes instead of the single-chord, monodicWorld Music: The Rough Guide, p. 63. drone common to Indian music.Lavezzoli, pp. 20, 21. ==Recording== Shankar recorded "I Am Missing You" for Shankar Family & Friends (1974), his first full studio album with Harrison as his producer.Rodriguez, pp. 236–37. Two recordings of the song were made for the album,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 139. since, as Shankar recalled: "George liked it so much he wanted to do a version of his own." For this version, Harrison arranged the song "for a rock band", author Peter Lavezzoli writes, using multiple drummers. The latter was one element of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound technique that Harrison had recently employed on "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long"John Metzger, "George Harrison Living in the Material World", Music Box, vol. 13 (11), November 2006 (retrieved 24 October 2013). and other songs on his self- produced Living in the Material World album.Leng, pp. 128–29, 130, 134.Schaffner, pp. 159–60. The sessions for Shankar Family & Friends took place at A&M; Studios in Los Angeles during April and May 1973,Badman, pp. 94, 98. soon after Harrison had recorded contributions to former bandmate Ringo Starr's first rock solo album, Ringo,Doggett, p. 198. notably on their joint composition "Photograph".Spizer, pp. 254, 306. Author Simon Leng suggests that "[i]t must have been a case of déjà vu for Starr" when he attended the Shankar session, due to the similarity in Harrison's musical arrangements for "I Am Missing You" and the equally Spector-influencedRodriguez, p. 261. "Photograph".Leng, p. 138. Starr played drums on the basic track for "I Am Missing You", while other participants had also recently contributed to Ringo:Madinger & Easter, p. 501.Rodriguez, pp. 74, 237.

Harrison played acoustic guitar and autoharp, while other contributions came from jazz musician Tom Scott, on fluteCastleman & Podrazik, pp. 205, 206. and soprano saxophone, and percussionist Emil Richards. The second version of the song, titled "I Am Missing You (Reprise)", features an arrangement closer to a folk ballad, combining Indian instrumentation such as bansuri and tabla, played by Hariprasad Chaurasia and Alla Rakha, respectively,Shankar, Raga Mala, pp. 222–23. with acoustic guitars and violins.Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 203, 206. In Raga Mala, Shankar says of this version: "we attempted to convey the sounds and atmosphere of Vrindavan, the ancient holy place where Krishna grew up." Further overdubbing on the material taped at A&M; Studios took place at Harrison's FPSHOT recording facility in England later in 1973 and through to early 1974. Although Shankar Family & Friends had started as an Apple Records project, the winding down of the Beatles' record label resulted in Harrison forming Dark Horse Records in May 1974,Clayson, pp. 345–46. to which Shankar and vocal duo Splinter were the two initial signings.Rodriguez, pp. 197–98.Woffinden, pp. 74, 85–86. ==Release and reception== thumb|left|upright|170px|Advertisement for Shankar's first album on Dark Horse Records, October 1974 Backed with the instrumental "Lust", "I Am Missing You" was the first single released on Dark Horse Records.Badman, p. 132.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 311. In the UK, it was issued as the lead single from Shankar Family & Friends, on 13 September 1974, but its US release was delayed until 6 November,Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 138, 139. a month after the album became available there.Badman, pp. 132, 133. The song appeared as the opening track on the album, with the reprise version sequenced as track 4. In his interview with Horne, released to UK radio stations that September as The Dark Horse Radio Special, Harrison spoke of the single's commercial appeal: "[It's] really like Top of the Pops – it should be top of the pops, because it's lovely." Despite the song's simplicity and catchiness, it failed to chart in Britain or America.Clayson, pp. 339, 345. Author Robert Rodriguez views "I Am Missing You" as "a pop/Indian delicacy" and recognises its potential for commercial success in a year when a rock version of "The Lord's Prayer" was an international hit for Sister Janet Mead. On release, Billboard magazine's reviewer listed the song first among the album's "best cuts" and wrote of the genre-crossing Shankar Family & Friends: "Above all, this set proves that Shankar is still a master of his craft and that not all music, pop or otherwise, need be of Western origins.""Top Album Picks", Billboard, 12 October 1974, p. 50. Noting its parent album's experimentation with jazz and funk styles, Simon Leng describes "I Am Missing You" as "[t]he most striking fusion on the album … a pop version of a Shankar bhajan" and praises the performance of "the sublime Lakshmi Shankar, whose voice soared through three octaves with ease". In an article about the song on his arts website Elsewhere, Graham Reid describes the recording as "a pure pop production" that "sounds sublime" and notes its hit potential "had [it] appeared within months of Harrison's 'My Sweet Lord' four years previous".Graham Reid, "Lakshmi Shankar: I Am Missing You (1974)", Elsewhere, 21 November 2011 (retrieved 23 October 2013). The Harrison-arranged "I Am Missing You" was included on Shankar's career-spanning box set In Celebration,Bruce Eder, "Ravi Shankar In Celebration", AllMusic (retrieved 28 August 2015). released in 1996.Lavezzoli, p. 197.Badman, pp. 551, 556. The reprise version appeared on a single-disc spin-off from this compilation, In Celebration – Highlights, providing what Billboard considered to be one of the "[h]ighlights among the highlights".Paul Verna (ed.), "Reviews & Previews" > "Albums", Billboard, 3 August 1996, p. 89 (retrieved 28 August 2015). In 2010, the song was made available again with the debut CD release of Shankar Family & Friends,Sean Michaels, "George Harrison and Ravi Shankar collaborations to be reissued", Guardian.co.uk, 18 August 2010 (retrieved 12 August 2014). issued as one of four discs in the Shankar–Harrison box set Collaborations.Richie Unterberger, "George Harrison/Ravi Shankar Collaborations", AllMusic (retrieved 12 August 2014).Olivia Harrison, "George Harrison and Ravi Shankar Box Set 'Collaborations' Is a Labor of Love for Me", spinner.com, 18 October 2010 (archived version retrieved 28 October 2013). In an otherwise favourable critique of Shankar Family & Friends, Sachyn Mital of PopMatters considers the pop version of "I Am Missing You" out of place there, saying: "This is one song I would avoid, [al]though its 'Reprise' smoothes over the outlandishness."Sachyn Mital, "Ravi Shankar and George Harrison: Collaborations", PopMatters, 19 October 2010 (retrieved 13 August 2014). Reviewing for The Second Disc, Joe Marchese opines: "The album gets off to a wonderful start with 'I Am Missing You,' as sung by Lakshmi Shankar. This rare English-language song shows off Shankar's gift for melody …"Joe Marchese, "Review: Ravi Shankar and George Harrison, 'Collaborations'", The Second Disc, 8 November 2010 (retrieved 18 August 2014). ==Performance== Shankar performed "I Am Missing You" throughout his and Harrison's North American tour in November–December 1974,Madinger & Easter, pp. 445–47. although live versions are available only on the many bootlegs from the tour.Leng, p. 170. The song was played as the finale to Shankar's set, midway through the show. As a forerunner to the 1980s world music genre,Leng, pp 168, 173.Rodriguez, p. 60. these live performances of "I Am Missing You" brought together Shankar's orchestra of distinguished Indian classical musicians – among them, Rakha, Chaurasia, Shivkumar Sharma, T.V. Gopalkrishnan, L. Subramaniam and Sultan KhanMadinger & Easter, p. 447. – and Harrison's entire band of top rock, jazz and funk players.Clayson, p. 340.Lavezzoli, p. 196. In February 2005, Shankar reinterpreted "I Am Missing You" in a jazz setting for a group project known as Jazzmin. Featuring six musicians from California and his daughter Anoushka on sitar, Jazzmin performed the song during a tour of India that year.Lavezzoli, p. 312. ==Personnel== *Ravi Shankar – direction, backing vocals *Lakshmi Shankar – vocals, backing vocals *George Harrison – acoustic guitars, autoharp, musical arrangement *Tom Scott – flutes, soprano saxophones *Nicky Hopkins – piano *Billy Preston – organ *Klaus Voormann – bass *Jim Keltner – drums *Ringo Starr – drums *Emil Richards – kartal, shakers *Kamala Chakravarty – backing vocals *Shivkumar Sharma – backing vocals ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * Keith Badman, The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970–2001, Omnibus Press (London, 2001; ). * Harry Castleman & Walter J.

Nicks explained the song in depth in the liner notes of her 1991 compilation album Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks:I Can't Wait - songfacts.com > "To understand this song, you sort of have to let yourself go a little > crazy. Love is blind, it never works out, but you just have to have it. I > think this was about the most exciting song that I had ever heard. My > friend, Rick, whom I had known since I was 18 and he was 13, brought over > this track with this incredible percussion thing, and gave it to me asking > me if I would listen to it and consider writing a song for it. I listened to > the song once, and pretended not to be that knocked out, but the second Rick > left, I ran in my little recording studio and wrote 'I Can't Wait.' It took > all night, and I think it is all about how electric I felt about this music. > And that night, that SATURDAY night, Rick and I went into a BIG studio and > recorded it. I sang it only once, and have never sung it since in the > studio. Some vocals are magic and simply not able to beat. So I let go of > it, as new to me as it was; but you know, now when I hear it on the radio, > this incredible feeling comes over me, like something really incredible is > about to happen." ==Chart performance== "I Can't Wait" first charted in Australia, debuting on the Kent Music Report chart on 13 January 1986, peaking at No. 20 in February.

Nicks says that she did drugs on the set of all her videos of the era, however, regarding the video for "I Can't Wait" she said in I Want My MTV:Songfacts > "I look at that video, I look at my eyes, and I say to myself, 'Could you > have laid off the pot, the coke and the tequila for three days, so you could > have looked a little better?

The group was formed in 2001 by singer- songwriter and former amateur boxer Michael Dean Damron, and their sound reflects a varied influence of heavy southern style rock, 1970s rock, country, blues, and punk rock. Lyrically the band is known for progressive political themes, speaking out against conservatives, gun rights advocates, and the Westboro Baptist Church among others, as well as for darker, country influenced songs about fear, loss, and death in modern America. They have been lauded for their high energy live performances driven by Damron's distinctive growl and the band's dueling lead guitar and harmonica. ==History== After spending a few years as a boxer in the army's 101st Airborne Division, an amateur boxer in Las Vegas, and a stint as the bassist for Texas-based Mercury Records artist Tablet, Damron relocated to Portland, Oregon in the late 1990s and began performing as a singer/songwriter. After some early success as a solo artist, he decided to try his hand at a heavier, more 1970s rock oriented sound. Borrowing the famous boast of bare knuckled boxing champion John L. Sullivan for the group's name, in 2001 Damron created I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch in the House and began performing locally in Portland. Initially the band was composed of a rotation of local blues, rock, and country stalwarts, but Damron soon decided he wanted to focus more seriously on the full band, and recruited guitarist Jon Burbank, drummer Flapjack Texas, bassist Dewey Neilsen, and David Lipkind on harmonica to record the band's first album, Creepy Little Noises, which was released in 2002 on In Music We Trust Records. Neilson left the band shortly after, and bassist Mole Harris joined in late 2002, finalizing the group's permanent lineup. The group began touring regularly throughout the US from 2002 through 2006, releasing 3 more well acclaimed albums along the way; 2003's Put Here to Bleed, 2004's Menace, and their live album, 2006's Live at Dante's. At the end of 2006, citing a lack of fun and a desire to work on more varied styles, Damron left the band. The band had recently finished recording much of what was to be their 4th studio album, and Damron later re-recorded some of the songs for 2008's Bad Days Ahead, now performing as Michael Dean Damron & Thee Loyal Bastards. After nearly 4 years, the band reunited in 2010. They completed recording and post- production of the album that had nearly been finished in 2006, and in late 2010 released The Sounds of Dying on Denver, CO based Suburban Home Records. They resumed playing regularly and occasionally touring throughout the western US. In 2011, they self-released Live in Seattle, a live DVD of a 2010 performance at the legendary Tractor Tavern in Seattle, WA. In April 2013 the band completed production on their 5th studio album, entitled Mayberry. The album was released in June 2013 on the band's own label, Sad Crow Records. ==Personnel== *Michael Dean Damron - vocals/guitar *Jon Burbank - lead guitar *David Lipkind - harmonica *Flapjack Texas - drums *Mole Harris - bass ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Creepy Little Noises - 2002 - In Music We Trust Records *Put Here to Bleed - 2003 - In Music We Trust Records *Menace - 2005 - In Music We Trust Records *Live at Dante's - 2006 - In Music We Trust Records *The Sounds of Dying - 2010 - Suburban Home Records *Live in Seattle DVD - 2011 - Self Released *Mayberrry - 2013 - Sad Crow Records ===Appearances=== *This One's for the Fellows - a tribute to The Young Fresh Fellows - 2004 BlueDisguise Records == References == Category:Musical groups from Portland, Oregon Category:2001 establishments in Oregon Category:Musical groups established in 2001

The album featured guest appearances by Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott, Danja Mowf, Kandi, Pretty Ugly, Big Swells, Musiq Soulchild, AAries, Cee-Lo Green, Pretty Willie, Jazze Pha and Nicole Wray's brother Kenny Wray.

Two other promo singles, "Your Favorite Joints" and "Ghostwriter," were excluded from the album but were added to its sampler release.

39415610	I Apologize campaign	"I Apologize" () is an online campaign launched in December 2008 in Turkey by numerous journalists, politicians, and professors, calling for a collective apology for the Armenian genocide, which the campaign calls "the Great Catastrophe that Ottoman Armenians were subjected to in 1915." The campaign was launched by Prof. Ahmet İnsel, politician Baskın Oran, Dr. Cengiz Aktar, and journalist Ali Bayramoğlu. The campaign emphasizes regret on behalf of Turkey that Armenian requests for recognition of the 1915 genocide has been actively suppressed within Turkey. The campaign was signed by 5,000 people within the first 24 hours, and had collected over 30,000 signatories by January 2009. The campaign created widespread outrage in Turkish society. ==The campaign== The campaign is conducted online; the message that visitors are invited to sign states: The campaigners emphasized that point that the initiative was not politically motivated but rather a personal and individual motivation. The website has been translated into many different languages including Arabic, Armenian, English, Greek, and Russian. At last count, the campaign has over 32,000 signatures. ==Reactions== *Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said: "I neither accept nor support this campaign. We did not commit a crime, therefore we do not need to apologise, it will not have any benefit other than stirring up trouble, disturbing our peace and undoing the steps which have been taken." "These Turkish intellectuals must have committed the genocide, since they are the ones who are apologizing." *Nationalist Action Party (MHP), a far-right opposition party, issued a statement that stated: "There is no single page in the honorable history of the Turkish nation for which we should be embarrassed, and no crime for which we should apologize. No one has the right to smear our ancestors by deviating from history, declaring them guilty, and ask them to apologize." **Devlet Bahçeli, the leader of MHP, also stated: "No one has the right to insult our ancestors, to present them as criminals and to ask for an apology." *Cemalettin Taşkıran was quoted as stating: "This is the biggest betrayal that could be shown to our forefathers.... The campaign was set up to hurt the unity of the Turkish nation and to prepare the way for Turkey's eventual recognition of Armenian claims of genocide." *A group of sixty retired Turkish diplomats described the initiative as "unfair, wrong and unfavorable to national interests." *Azerbaijani poet and National Assembly (Parliament) deputy Zelimhan Yakup, wrote a poem which was entitled "A Turk doesn't apologize to the enemy" (). ==Aftermath== The signatories received many death threats. Ece Temelkuran, one signer, claimed to have received 200 e-mails after signing, of which 150 were threats.

39431630	I Can Hear Your Voice	I Can Hear Your Voice () is a 2013 South Korean television series starring Lee Bo-young, Lee Jong-suk, Yoon Sang-hyun, and Lee Da-hee. It aired on SBS from June 5 to August 1, 2013, on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 18 episodes. Originally set for 16 episodes, due to its successful ratings, the series was extended by 2 episodes. ==Synopsis== After overcoming a difficult childhood, Jang Hye-sung (Lee Bo-young) becomes a public defender, but she is pragmatic, self-preserving, and jaded. Her life changes when she encounters Park Soo-ha (Lee Jong-suk), a high school senior with the supernatural ability to read other people's thoughts by looking into their eyes. Soo-ha gained his mind-reading ability when witnessing his father getting murdered ten years previously. His father's death had initially been dismissed as a car accident until Hye-sung, then a high school girl (Kim So-hyun), gave a decisive testimony in court despite the killer's threats (Jung Woong-in). Soo-ha has been searching for her ever since. As Hye-sung works with Soo-ha and a cop- turned-lawyer Gwan-woo (Yoon Sang-hyun), she gradually lets go of her pursuit of money and glory. Together, the unlikely team uses unconventional methods to solve their cases. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Lee Bo-young as Lawyer Jang Hye-sung ** Kim So-hyun as 15-year-old Hye-sung :Smart and hardworking, Hye-sung was raised by a poor but loving mother. After being falsely accused of causing an incident involving fireworks, she gets expelled from high school. She bravely testifies on the witness stand, causing the murderer of Park Soo-ha's father to be convicted and imprisoned. But both experiences change her, and ten years later, Hye-sung is an apathetic public defender who doesn't care about her clients and only does her job for the salary. * Lee Jong-suk as Park Soo-ha ** Goo Seung-hyun as 9-year-old Soo-ha :After witnessing his father killed (and almost getting killed himself), 9 year old Soo-ha gains the supernatural ability to read people's minds by looking at their eyes. When high school teenager Hye-sung testified in court to corroborate his testimony regarding the killer, he swore that he would always protect and guard her. He nurses a crush on her for a decade, but when he meets her again, he's dismayed to find her completely different from what he has expected. * Yoon Sang-hyun as Cha Gwan-woo :A cop who brings his idealism, empathy and attention to detail to his new job as a public defender. Though outwardly geeky and meek, he has a keen intelligence that sees new angles in his cases. * Lee Da-hee as Seo Do- yeon ** Jung Min-ah as 15-year-old Do-yeon :A prosecutor who comes from a rich, well-connected family, with her father being a judge and her mother a doctor. Do-yeon has always pushed herself to become the perfect daughter to please her parents. She was in rivalry with Hye-sung in high school and when a fireworks accident nearly caused her to lose her eyesight, she blames Hye-sung for it, despite the latter's denials. Do-yeon was also a witness to the murder of Park Soo-ha's father, but at the last minute, she loses her courage and doesn't testify. ===Supporting=== * Jung Woong-in as Min Joon-gook, the murderer of Soo-ha's father, with whom he had a grudge with. He was jailed for 10 years as a result of Hye-sung's testimony, which decisively led to him convicted of murder.

39491480	I Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery	I Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery was a brigade of the Royal Horse Artillery which existed in the early part of the 20th century. It was dissolved at the outbreak of World War I as its constituent batteries were posted to other formations. Post-war, the brigade was reformed, serving in the UK, Egypt and India before being redesignated as 1st Regiment, RHA in May 1938 at Aldershot. The brigade had an earlier incarnation as A Brigade, RHA, formed from the Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery in 1864 before being broken up in 1889. ==History== === A Brigade, RHA=== Royal Horse Artillery brigades did not exist as an organizational or operational grouping of batteries until 1 July 1859 when the Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery was formed. It commanded all the existing horse artillery batteries of the Royal Artillery: *A Battery, Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery at Aldershot *B Battery, Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery at Woolwich *C Battery, Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery at Cahir *D Battery, Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery in Bombay *E Battery, Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery in Bengal *F Battery, Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery in Bengal *G Battery, Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery at Portobello Barracks, Dublin *H Battery, Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery in Madras *I Battery, Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery at Woolwich *K Battery, Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery at Aldershot As a result of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British Crown took direct control of India from the East India Company on 1 November 1858 under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858. The Presidency armies transferred to the direct authority of the British Crown and its European units were transferred to the British Army. Henceforth artillery, the mutineers most effective arm, was to be the sole preserve of the British Army (with the exception of certain Mountain Artillery batteries). On 19 February 1862, the Bengal, Bombay and Madras Horse Artilleries transferred to the Royal Artillery as its 2nd to 5th Horse Brigades. The 1st Brigade with 10 batteries was much larger than the other four (with four to seven batteries each). A reorganization of the Horse Artillery on 13 April 1864 saw 1st Brigade split as A Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery and B Brigade, 2nd Brigade become C Brigade, 3rd become D Brigade, 4th become E Brigade, and 5th become F Brigade. As battery designations were tied to the brigade the battery was assigned to, the batteries were also redesignated. A Horse Brigade, RA comprised: *A Battery, A Horse Brigade (A/A) - formerly A Battery at Curragh *B Battery, A Horse Brigade (B/A) - formerly B Battery at Dorchester *C Battery, A Horse Brigade (C/A) - formerly C Battery at Woolwich *D Battery, A Horse Brigade (D/A) - formerly G Battery at Woolwich *E Battery, A Horse Brigade (E/A) - formerly K Battery at Dublin From 1866, the term "Royal Horse Artillery" appeared in Army List hence the brigade was designated A Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery from about this time. Another reorganization on 14 April 1877 saw the number of brigades reduced to three (of 10 batteries each). A Brigade absorbed the batteries of the old B Brigade (which was reformed with the batteries of the old C and D Brigades). The number of brigades was further reduced to two (of 13 batteries each) in 1882. C Brigade was broken up on 1 April 1882 and its batteries transferred to A and B Brigades. The brigade system was finally abolished in 1889. Henceforth, batteries were designated in a single alphabetical sequence in order of seniority from date of formation. ===I Brigade, RHA=== ====First formation==== The brigade system was revived in 1901. Each brigade now commanded just two batteries and a small staff (a Lieutenant-Colonel in command, an adjutant and a brigade sergeant major). Initially, batteries were not assigned to brigades in any particular order, but in 1906, at the insistence of Edward VII, brigades were redesignated so that batteries were roughly in order of seniority (hence I Brigade commanded A Battery and B Battery). I Brigade, RHA was formed on 1 March 1901 as the V Brigade-Division, RHA with A Battery and BB Battery. In 1903 it was redesignated as V Brigade, RHA and was stationed at Dorchester. On 1 October 1906, it was redesignated as I Brigade, RHA. On 8 May 1913, BB Battery was disbanded. It was replaced on 1 August with Z Battery (from XIV Brigade, RHA) but was in turn disbanded on 24 December. It was replaced by B Battery (from II Brigade, RHA). By the time World War I broke out, the brigade was in Ambala, India assigned to 3rd (Lahore) Division. On mobilization, A Battery was assigned to the newly formed I Indian Brigade, RHA with 1st Indian Cavalry Division (attached to 3rd (Ambala) Cavalry Brigade) and sailed for the Western Front in October 1914. B Battery also sailed for the United Kingdom in 1914. In January 1915, it joined XV Brigade, RHA at Leamington and was assigned to 29th Division. With the departure of its batteries, the brigade HQ was dissolved. ====Second formation==== Early in 1919, I Brigade, RHA was reformed at Woolwich and Bordon with *A Battery, RHA from XVI Brigade, RHA in Germany in May 1919 *B Battery, RHA from XV Brigade, RHA in Germany in April 1919 *M Battery, RHA from Risalpur, India in March 1919 On 20 November 1919 A Battery absorbed Y Battery, on 7 January 1920 B Battery absorbed Z Battery and on 11 February 1920 M Battery absorbed AA Battery, all of VIII Brigade, RHA. Finally, on 14 February 1920 the Headquarters of VIII Brigade was absorbed into the HQ of I Brigade. By March 1920, the brigade was overseas again: A Battery was in Mesopotamia, B Battery in Palestine and M Battery (with the brigade HQ) was in Egypt. In October 1923 it returned to Exeter (A Battery at Trowbridge) and in November 1926 was at Aldershot where O Battery, RHA replaced M Battery. In November 1929 it was at Newport (B Battery at Trowbridge) before moving to Abbassia, Egypt in October 1931. A Battery was the first Royal Horse Artillery battery to be mechanized. In 1934 it replaced its horses and 13 pounders with 3.7" Howitzers towed by Light Dragon gun tractors. By October 1937, the whole brigade was mechanized, and stationed at Aldershot. ===1st Regiment, RHA=== In 1938, field artillery brigades were reorganized as two 12-gun batteries. As a result, the existing 6-gun batteries were linked in pairs. On 11 May, A Battery and E Battery (from Sialkot, India) were linked as A/E Battery, RHA and B Battery and O Battery were linked as B/O Battery, RHA. With effect from May 1938, brigades were redesignated as regiments. On 11 May, I Brigade became 1st Regiment, RHA. ==See also== ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * ==External links== *The Royal Horse Artillery on The Long, Long Trail Category:Royal Horse Artillery brigades Category:Artillery units and formations of World War I Category:Military units and formations established in 1859 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1889 Category:Military units and formations established in 1901 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1914 Category:Military units and formations established in 1919 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1938 Category:1859 establishments in the United Kingdom

39654674	I Can't Believe It's a Clip Show	"I Can't Believe It's a Clip Show" is the 10th episode and series finale of the second season of the US animated sitcom The Critic. ==Background== The A.V. Club explains, "The animated sitcom The Critic survived its first cancellation by ABC when Fox picked it up for a second season, but the show wasn’t so lucky the second time around. Though there were rumors of a third pick-up—by UPN this time—the original adventures of film critic Jay Sherman did come to an end on Fox". On April 21, 1995, The New York Daily News reported on an incident revolving around the episode's airing: "In response to Wednesday's terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City, Fox has pulled the episode of The Critic that had been scheduled to air this Sunday night. Fox and the show's production company, Columbia Tri-Star Television, decided that it would be insensitive to try to get laughs from such an image right now, notwithstanding its comedic context. Instead, an episode titled "All the Duke's Men," which is heavy on political satire, will run at 8:30 Sunday night". ==Plot== ShareTV describes its plot thus: "Jay hosts his tenth anniversary show live from Carnegie Hall, where he shows movie clips from past episodes like Rabbi P.I., and many others. Jay's anniversary show at the Carnegie Hall gets held hostage by terrorists, who threaten to blow up the place with a bomb tied to Jay's waist." ==Characters== * Jon Lovitz - Jay Sherman * Nancy Cartwright - Margo Sherman * Christine Cavanaugh - Marty Sherman * Gerrit Graham - Franklin Sherman * Doris Grau - Doris Grossman * Judith Ivey - Eleanor Sherman * Nick Jameson - Vlada Veramirovich * Maurice LaMarche - Jeremy Hawke/Spartacus * Charles Napier - Duke Phillips * Park Overall - Alice Tompkins ==Critical reception== AnimatedViwes said, "Unfortunately, this turned out to be the final show, but remains a fitting tribute, and closes on one of the best public digs between a series producer and a network that I've ever come across – classic!" TheDigitalFix said this "final episode (sadly the worst of them all) [is] utterly pointless and sadly a bad end to the series". Slant magazine said, > Fox cancelled The Critic, forcing it to end on the intentionally shoddy 23rd > installment "I Can't Believe It's a Clip Show." Here The Critic achieves a > postmodern sophistication alien to most series television. While hosting his > 10th Anniversary special (we fans can only wish) at Carnegie Hall, Jay and > his family are taken hostage by a deranged group of terrorists. Jean and > Reiss call attention to the show's very mechanisms, leaving in obvious > mistakes like mismatched lip movements and repetitive animations. As the > terrorists' bomb counts down, clips from the entire series play as both > counterpoint and summation, all leading up to an explosive finale instigated > by the legendary Milton Berle, clad in ninja garb. A climactic, sincere > spoof of West Side Story leaves us with a full-on view of all the characters > we've grown to love over two networks and too short a time. And upon the > final fade-out it is near impossible to hold back a protest at the > unfairness of it all. So we answer back to the darkness with our own bitter > and ironic reading of Jay Sherman's signature catchphrase: "It stinks!". The A.V. Club said: > There's barely any plot to "I Can't Believe It's A Clip Show." The episode > is more a clearinghouse for every movie parody idea that The Critic writers > had been unable to squeeze into the previous 22 episodes.

39778253	I Can't Sing!	I Can't Sing! The X Factor Musical was a musical comedy written by Harry Hill, and Steve Brown. Based on the TV series The X Factor, the musical made its West End and world premiere in March 2014, at the London Palladium. Due to low ticket sales, it closed just 6 weeks and 3 days later on 10 May 2014, reportedly losing £4 million. ==Background== In December 2012, Harry Hill announced that he was working on a musical based on the talent show The X Factor. The show was confirmed in 2013, and it was announced that the musical would open in London in 2014, and would be called It's Time to Face the Musical! On 22 May, it was announced the show would now be called I Can't Sing!, and that it would play the London Palladium, with tickets going on sale the following day. The show was written by Harry Hill and is directed by Sean Foley, with choreography by Kate Prince, set design by Es Devlin, costume design by Leah Archer, illusions by Scott Penrose, lighting design by Jon Clark, orchestrations by Chris Egan, sound design by Gareth Owen and sound effects by Ben and Max Ringham. An original score of 19 songs was penned, by Hill with music by Steve Brown. At the press launch for the show on 2 September 2013, Simon Cowell said of the concept of an X Factor Musical: “I thought the idea of an X Factor musical, if it was too pompous, would be rubbish, and I did not want it to appear like a cash cow. I wanted it to be a celebration of the show but at the same time poke fun at what we do, because you can’t take it too seriously. Harry of all the people was the right person. His observation of the show in the past has been spot on.” People parodied in the show include Simon Cowell, Cheryl Cole, Louis Walsh, and Dermot O'Leary. ==Production history== ===West End (2014)=== On 30 August 2013, it was announced that Nigel Harman would play the role of Simon Cowell, with Alan Morrissey playing the role of Max and Cynthia Erivo playing Chenice the main contestant in the story. The production's first public performance came at the Royal Variety Performance in November 2013, performing a medley of "Please Simon" and "I Can't Sing!", the show's title song. I Can't Sing! began rehearsals on 6 January, with previews commencing on 5 March 2014, at the London Palladium, London, before holding its official opening gala night on 26 March. The production had been scheduled to begin previews on 27 February, however the opening two previews were cancelled due to technical issues with the show's set. Following the initial cancellations, the production had to cancel a further preview performance, due to a key mechanism within the set not functioning correctly. Problems continued into previews, with early performances intervals lasting 50 mins, due to set changeovers between acts taking longer than expected and one preview getting cancelled at the interval due to electrical problems. A typical London performance ran two hours and 30 minutes, including one interval of 20 mins. The production closed on the 10 May, just six weeks and three days after its official opening night. Speaking about the closure, Cowell said “We took a punt and it didn't work out. If I could do things different, I would have gone to local theatres and built up a following. We went in too big a theatre - it's the biggest theatre in the West End." ==Music== In September 2013, four tracks were released on SoundCloud and through the shows official website. The songs were "I Can't Sing", "If That's Not Entertainment", "Please Simon" and "I Wanna Be Like Bono", although the latter did not make it into the final show. The musical uses a nine-member orchestra consisting of keyboard, guitar, bass, drums, percussion, trumpets and reeds. On 1 April 2020 a YouTube user uploaded all the songs from the show onto the site. The released songs were recorded live during one of the performances through a soundboard. Harry Hill acknowledged the leak on his Instagram page, saying he was "very pleased" to hear the songs, while jokingly calling the uploader "naughty" and referring to the musical as a "megaflop". ===Musical numbers=== ; Act I * "Overture" - Ensemble * "If That's Not Entertainment" - Young Simon, Ensemble * "It Could Be Me" - Max, Brenda, Vladimir, Alterboyz, Ensemble * "Life Is Lovely" - Chenice, Grandpa, Ensemble * "Please Simon" - Brenda, Vladimir, Alterboyz, Soul Star, Ensemble * "All Woman" - Brenda, Liam, Ensemble * "I Can't Sing!" - Chenice, Max, Barlow * "Better than That" - Hunchback * "The Hugging Song" - Liam * "Missing You Already" - Chenice, Max * "X Factor Fever" - Chenice, Max, Liam, Brenda, Ensemble ; Act II * "Here Come the Judges" - Brunhilde, Liam, Gerrard Smalls, Simon, Jordy, Louis, Ensemble * "Uncomplicated Love" - Simon, Gerrard Smalls, Max, Ensemble * "Uncomplicated Love (reprise)" - Barlow * "Falling in Love with Myself" - Jordy, Chenice, Ensemble * "Make a Wish...

39814912	I Am a God	"I Am a God" is a song by American rapper Kanye West from his sixth studio album Yeezus (2013). The song credits God as a featured performer. It was produced by West, Hudson Mohawke, Daft Punk. and Mike Dean, and includes vocals from Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. The song contains samples of "Forward Inna Dem Clothes", written by Capleton and H. Hart, and performed by the latter, and "Are Zindagi Hai Khel" by Manna Dey, R. D. Burman and Asha Bhosle. West explained the message of "I Am a God" on various occasions, once claiming that it was for those who lacked confidence in themselves. The song includes elements of industrial and electronic music. West hypes himself up throughout it and references Jesus in comparison to him. The song received widely positive reviews from music critics, with West's arrogance being praised by a number of them. "I Am a God" charted on both the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 and US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs charts at number 9 and 37 respectively in 2013. West debuted the song by performing it live at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala in May 2013 and later performed it on multiple occasions throughout that year. One line in the song was changed to being rapped without instrumentation when West updated the album on Apple Music in 2016. == Background == Since its release, West has talked about the message of the song in numerous interviews. In an interview with W in June 2013, it was made known that the song was inspired by a 'diss' from a major fashion designer during Paris Fashion Week, where West was informed that he would be invited to a widely anticipated runway show only on the condition that he agree not to attend any other shows. Thomas Bangalter of French duo Daft Punk revealed in an April 2013 interview centered around their album Random Access Memories that during the recording sessions, the duo used part of their time to work with West on music for the rapper's next album. In reference to the material recorded by West, Bangalter stated that "It was very raw: he was rapping – kind of screaming primally, actually" and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of Daft Punk added that "Kanye doesn't give a fuck." Bangalter stated in a July 2013 interview that the duo "were the first people that Kanye came to" when working on Yeezus and they stand among the album's major producers. Hudson Mohawke co-produced the song and also stands among the album's major producers; he had previously helped produce West's work in 2012 on the GOOD Music collaboration "Mercy". Prior to working with West on Yeezus, Justin Vernon of Bon Iver had appeared on his 2010 single "Monster" from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Vernon stated of collaborating with West again: "After Twisted Fantasy, I kind of assumed that I'd get the call again at some point. I get along with Kanye really well and I think his musical decisions are exquisite." Before it was officially announced that West's sixth studio album was titled Yeezus, it had been rumored to be titled I Am God, which caused controversy. The information was later revealed that it was likely for there to be a song titled "I Am a God" on West's then-upcoming album. West's camp said the title was a reference to Psalm 82: "I said, 'You are gods, / And all of you are children of the Most High." West offered an explanation of the song in 2015 during the course of an interview with Show Studio, stating: > The reason why I made the song 'I Am A God' is so those people that feel > less than can turn it up and say it loud and embrace it for themselves, that > God is inside all of us. It wasn't about specifically me. It was about us as > a race; that we are an extension of God, that we all have God inside of us. Accusations of blasphemy lead by the title were defended by Priest Father Matthew Moretz on August 30, 2013. The song credits God as a featured performer, which had been rumoured before the album's release. During a 2013 interview with Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1, West responded to criticism of claiming to be a God by delving into the topic of classism and self-hate, positing the question: "Would it have been better if I had a song that said, 'I Am a Nigger?' Or if I had a song that said, 'I Am a Gangsta'? Or I had a song that said, 'I Am a Pimp'? All of those colors and patinas fit better on a person like me, right?" West would go on to offer further explanations in the midst of his performances during The Yeezus Tour in October of that year. == Recording == On June 12, 2013, six days before Yeezus was released, a video was uploaded on West's website of him recording vocals for "I Am a God" with producers Rick Rubin and Mike Dean. Record producer Noah Goldstein revealed that after first hearing West say "I am a God," everyone was like "OK, that's where we're going-- let's go all the way there." Hudson Mohawke elaborated, revealing the track to be one of the first songs that West had for the album and stated that it "was like the blueprint." Goldstein compared the recording process of the track to that of the 2011 collaborative song "New Day" by West and Jay-Z from Watch the Throne. In October 2016, a demo of the track was uploaded to SoundCloud, which featured a new verse and synth line. == Composition == West repeats "God!" in an exasperated way at the end of "Black Skinhead" to show the mind of the character portrayed on Yeezus as mutating the external idea of God into an internal one. This leads into West hyping himself up on "I Am a God". The song, like most tracks on Yeezus, includes elements of industrial music. The electronic soundscape of the song was mainly crafted by the producers Daft Punk. West screams within it. The song samples "Forward Inna Dem Clothes", written by Capelton and H. Hart, and performed by the former, and "Are Zindagi Hai Khel" by Manna Dey, R. D. Burman and Asha Bhosle. West uses certain lyrics to draw a comparison between Jesus and himself, with the former being the most high. West updated "I Am a God" solely on Apple Music in April 2016. At one minute and 15 seconds into the song, the beat was changed to cutting out under the line "Y'all better quit playing with God." == Release and reception == "I Am a God" was released on June 18, 2013, as the third track on West's sixth studio album Yeezus. Before its release on the album, he debuted the song at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala in New York City on May 6, 2013. West performed the song wearing a "studded mask" and dedicated it to his then-fiancé Kim Kardashian. Since release, "I Am a God" has received universal acclaim from music critics, with West's arrogance receiving praise from a number of them. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone looked at it as an example on Yeezus of where "Kanye's lyrics are pretty focused" and he renders "his classic themes as petulant primal screams." Dolan called the song "a lurching, nightmarish throbber." The staff of Billboard wrote of the song: "Through shooting synths, squeals and mushed bass, Kanye revels in all the negativity he's endured -- the hate received for everything from his fashion sense to brand of hip-hop -- and proclaims himself to be a god 'until the day I get struck by lightning.'" Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork claimed that the song "is not simply the latest self-important blast from one of pop culture's pre-eminent egoists. For starters, the track sounds less triumphant than breathtakingly vexed, crashing in with a gnarled dancehall vocal sample and paranoid sawtooth synths that aim to destroy. Here, Kanye raps about loyalty, respect, threesomes, and, yes, croissants with the urgency of someone being chased by a 30-ton steamroller." Dombal claimed for the primal screams to pierce the song and bring "the beat's heaving evil" to a brief halt. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian viewed "I Am a God" as what "offers up a bass pulse overlaid with epic, cavernous synthesisers" that he claimed to be influenced by Daft Punk. Petridis looked at the song's short- circuiting as being "simultaneously incredibly powerful and deeply disconcerting." Slate's Forrest Wickman cites "I Am a God" as one of the album's tracks that "rattle as if they'd been produced by industrial hip-hop group Death Grips" and compared the song's heavy bass to the band's single "Come Up and Get Me." Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times wrote of West's performance: "Here's a man so powerful that he can boss around both massage therapists and waiters, as he does in 'I Am a God': 'I am a god / So hurry up with my damn massage / in the French … restaurant / hurry up with my damn croissants.' If it weren't embedded within a truly frightening song featuring curdling screams and deep bass, the line would be laughable. As presented, his intentions are unclear — other than to remind you that, you know, 'I am a god!'" Rolling Stone ranked the track at number 65 on their list of the 100 best songs of 2013, writing of it: "This is the greatest hate-rap screed by a deity with dangerously low blood sugar in ages." NME ranked the track at number 18 on their list of the 50 best songs of 2013, writing: "Mesmeric in its arrogance and undeniable in its greatness, only Kanye would've had the stones to attempt a song like this with such poker-faced seriousness, and only he could've managed to pull it off." == Commercial performance == Upon the release of Yeezus, the song debuted at number 9 on the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 and lasted for one week. That same week, "I Am a God" entered at number 37 on the US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The entry stood as the first time that God had ever charted on US Billboard charts as a credited artist and associate chart production manager Alex Vitoulis initially added God to the artists of the Billboard computerized charts system, which caused laughter. The following week, the song descended 11 places to number 48 on the chart. == Live performances == "I Am a God" was first performed live by West at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala on May 6, 2013. West later performed the song at the 2013 Governors Ball Music Festival on June 9, nine days before the album's release, alongside other tracks from it. At the opening concert of The Yeezus Tour in Seattle's KeyArena, the song was the ninth to be performed by West. West delivered a live performance of the song at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on November 19 as part of the tour. The performance began with West being picked up off the ground by women after he had ended a performance of "Black Skinhead" lying on his back. West left the line "Hurry up with my damn croissants!" to be shouted by the crowd. == In the media == In August 2013, The Association of French Bakers penned a letter to West over the lyrics "In a French-ass restaurant/Hurry up with my damn croissants," telling him to be patient. The letter stressed that a croissant cannot be rushed because one is comparable to a work of art, though the bakers gave West a pass and stated that they take his lyrics seriously. The trailer of 2013 film House of Versace was set to the song, which included Gina Gershon saying lines such as "I was a girl in power since the day I was born" and "I am Versace!"

It was released on July 15, 2013, as the second single from his album Love Is Everything. ==Content== Strait and his band were finished recording the album when Norma, George's wife, made everyone unpack and cut the Newtown, Connecticut-inspired single "At its core, ‘I Believe’ is about faith — a subject this singer has approached with underrated deftness" and "puts his faith on display as never before" "Strait was hesitant to include the song, as he didn’t want to misrepresent the families of the victims or be accused of somehow profiting from their tears... his sincerity triumphs on this beautifully crafted tribute to the victims." The victims that inspired this song where the lives taken from a school shooting in Newtown Connecticut in December 2012. ==Critical reception== Billy Dukes of Taste of Country rated "I Believe" 4.5 out of 5 stars and calls it "arguably the best of the 13" and shouldn't keep him from earning a Song of the Year consideration.

On August 22, 2013, he announced the I Am Tour Dates, a tour in promotion of I Am which ran from September 14, 2013, until November 19, 2013, with supporting acts including YG, Zed Zilla, Shy Glizzy and Cash Out.

The numbers going fairly well. Most important to me, the fans loved it. Fans fuck wit' it. ...Just givin' the people what they want. I've seen a lot of growth with this album. We doing different platforms, TV shows, we doing shows in different markets. Just being on different blog sites. I'm seeing a lot of different things coming. I guess it's because of the growth of the material that I put out on this album." ==Singles== On July 23, 2013, the album's first single "Act Right" featuring Jeezy and YG was released. On July 24, 2013, the music video for "Act Right" featuring Jeezy and YG was released. "Act Right" has since peaked at number 100 on the US Billboard Hot 100.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 5 reviews. David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars, saying "Good news for fans who stuck it out this long is that I Am is the moment when the skies clear, as the album comes on strong with a hard-hitting set of openers, and then, the high quality is maintained with a set of easy-flowing supportive songs that broaden the LP spectrum, all without leaving Gotti's comfort zone." Ronald Grant of HipHopDX gave the album two and a half stars out of five, saying "At the end of the day, I Am’s overall passable production and flashes of potency and strength keep it afloat for a time. And Gotti deserves commendation for his talent at bringing an explicit rawness, reality and affection to his autobiographical bars. But even those considerations aren’t enough to make this album worth more than a few listens, sadly relying on a continuous set of monotonous hooks and overly used trap beats that saturate a strong majority of current popular Rap music." Reed Jackson of XXL gave the album an L, saying "On the majority of I Am, he stays rooted in the ideas and melodies that he’s been refining since he first dropped From Da Dope Game 2 Da Rap Game over 10 year ago. The self-proclaimed “King Of Memphis” has lived up to his title again, and perhaps this album will help him continue his reign for another 10 years." Paul Cantor of Vibe gave the album a positive review, saying "If there’s one glaring downside to I Am, it’s that a handful of songs sound, well, a lot like other songs. [...] One on the one hand you applaud Gotti for implementing a hit- making formula so effectively, and after all, songs sounding like other songs is not an uncommon thing. But on the other hand, why couldn't Gotti couldn't come up with his own blueprint for smash records? Maybe after all these years he didn't want to leave too much up to chance. Not sure we can be mad at that." Grant Jones of RapReviews gave the album a 4.5 out of 10, saying "If you can get past the ignorance, this is enjoyable for what it is - an album to be played loudly in your car, with the windows down and a middle finger up to anybody who looks at you disapprovingly." Louis Goggans of the Memphis Flyer gave the album a positive review, saying "Gotti’s transition from dominating the underground rap circuit to enjoying mainstream success with hits like “5 Star” and “Men Lie, Women Lie” convey that hard work pays off. And he continues to utilize the very same work ethic that's brought him to this point in his career on his latest project. Although Gotti doesn't sway too far from his usual topics on the album, he doesn't display any signs of decline creatively either. After more than 10 years in the game, Gotti still has the ability to provide listeners with quality music and this is evident with I Am." ===Awards and nominations=== Year Ceremony Category Result 2014 2014 BET Hip Hop Awards Album of the Year rowspan="1" ==Commercial performance== I Am debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 48,000 copies in its first week, becoming Yo Gotti's first US top ten debut.

4012959	I Can't Dance	"I Can't Dance" is the fourth track from English rock band Genesis's fourteenth studio album, We Can't Dance (1991), and was released in December 1991 as the second single from the album. Lyrics were composed by drummer Phil Collins; music was written the band collectively. The song peaked at number seven on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, and also received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals in 1993. In Europe, the song reached number one in Belgium and the Netherlands, while peaking within the top five in Austria, Germany, and Portugal. ==Background== During one recording session, Mike Rutherford first created the main riff of the song he called "Heavy A Flat", to which Collins suddenly improvised the basic concept for "I Can't Dance". The riff was actually inspired by a Levi Strauss & Co. television commercial (in the studio, the song was created under the working title "Blue Jeans") that used The Clash song "Should I Stay or Should I Go". Originally, the band did not think of it as anything more than a joke recording that would be discarded quickly, because the song was too simple, too bluesy, and unlike Genesis' style. Tony Banks said in an interview: "It was one of those bits you thought was going to go nowhere. It sounded fun but wasn't really special". It was not until Banks decided to add keyboard sound effects to complement Rutherford's playing that "I Can't Dance" took on a different feeling. The band came to appreciate the sly humour inherent in the song and chose to not only record it properly, but to put it on the album as a single. Banks also said in an interview that the recording of a song that featured minimal production indicated a direction Genesis could have gone in to make themselves stand out better against the rising popularity of alternative rock: "Opposite to what Genesis has done as general practice, which is taking an idea and turning it into a long or complex composition, it was just taking an idea, and leaving it alone". ==Critical reception== The Daily Vault's Christopher Thelen found that "I Can't Dance" is "a goofy number that features Genesis mocking themselves for being un-hip. (Best line from this song: "Ooh, she's got a body under that shirt"—dirty old man alert!)" He added, "If you ever get a chance to view the video, watch it; it's hysterical." Sally Margaret Joy from Melody Maker wrote, "Phunny Phil, the Maker's Phavourite Phella, grinds and huffs his good self over one of those minimal, stab, crunch, plink, rock numbers. It seems to be a bit of a dig at those jeans ads that feature divine male bimbos." A reviewer from People Magazine described it as a "melodically fetching, radio-ready track", and "a simple slammer with an arrangement that shows off the group’s remarkable facility for aural atmospherics." Kara Manning from Rolling Stone declared it as "a gritty, tongue-in-cheek anthem for the average guy."Manning, Kara (9 January 1992). Album Review, Rolling Stone. Ted Shaw from The Windsor Star wrote that "I Can't Dance", "with its bluesy melody and metallic effects, is unlike anything the band has ever done, and it's a wonderful pop creation."Shaw, Ted (15 August 1992). "Record Review". The Windsor Star. ==Music video== The accompanying music video for "I Can't Dance" (directed by frequent collaborator Jim Yukich) illustrates the artifice and false glamour of television advertisements. Collins commented that the video was designed to poke fun at the models in jeans commercials, and each verse refers to things that models in these commercials do. During the first verse, he portrays a hitchhiker on a remote desert road in Hi Vista, California. A woman speeds past in a Porsche 911, then backs up to Collins and lets a lizard at his feet get in; she drives off, leaving him stranded. Collins is seen on a beach in the second verse, trying to pull his jeans away from a sunbather's angry dog; for the third, he loses them in a pool game at a bar. These scenes are intercut with footage of the band and film crew members setting up the areas as if to shoot a series of commercials. The video ends with a parody of the video for the Michael Jackson song "Black or White," in which Collins imitates Jackson's erratic dancing. Banks and Rutherford eventually arrive to escort Collins off the set, at which point he goes limp and they have to drag him away. The song created the "'I Can't Dance' dance" (a series of stiff, stylised motions). Collins explained in an interview that when he was at stage school, he would see kids that would always use the same hand and the same foot when they were tap dancing, meaning they could not co-ordinate. He then copied their movements and the 'dance' was born. Collins told Rolling Stone that the music video and the song were a joke about male models in jeans commercials who could not dance or talk, but could only walk in their jeans. He also said the audience was confused and could not figure out the joke because clearly Phil Collins can dance, as he dances at the end of the video. ==Release== Single releases contained an extended remix entitled "Sex Mix". This was later released on the Genesis Archive 2: 1976–1992 box set retitled as the "12" Mix". The remixers were brothers Howard Gray and Trevor Gray of Apollo 440. The B-side, "On the Shoreline", was also included on Genesis Archive 2: 1976–1992. The song features a sample of guitarist Mike Rutherford's guitar playing that was captured by Tony Banks during a jam session. The peculiar sound (dubbed "elephantus" by the band) was also used in the song "No Son of Mine." Several chord passages also appeared in "Living Forever." Rolling Stone commented that "On the Shoreline" is "enjoyable in an un-ironic way. Here, as usual, Phil Collins sounds most comfortable at the raspy apex of his vocal range, pushing his voice to the breaking point as Tony Banks' synths drift through like mists." The "Jesus He Knows Me" CD single also included a version titled "I Can't Dance (the other mix)" with a running length of 5:59. ==Live performances== "I Can't Dance" was played live during The Way We Walk, Calling All Stations (with Ray Wilson on vocals), Turn It On Again and The Last Domino? tours. On the band's Turn It On Again Tour and The Last Domino? Tour, it was included as an encore. During live performances, the song was transposed to a lower key to accommodate Collins' deepening voice. A live version appears on their albums The Way We Walk, Volume One: The Shorts, and Live over Europe 2007, as well as on their DVDs The Way We Walk - Live in Concert and When in Rome 2007 Rutherford and Daryl Stuermer accompanied Collins doing the walk across the stage. Ray Wilson continued to cover the song on his solo live album after his departure from Genesis. His version is a bluesier rendition, closer to the original. ==Track listings== * 7-inch and cassette single # "I Can't Dance" # "On the Shoreline" * 12-inch and CD single # "I Can't Dance" # "On the Shoreline" # "I Can't Dance" (sex mix) * Australian CD single and Japanese mini-album # "I Can't Dance" # "On the Shoreline" # "In Too Deep" (live) # "That's All" (live) * US CD single and Japanese mini-CD single # "I Can't Dance" (LP version) – 4:00 # "I Can't Dance" (sex mix) – 6:59 (7:02 in Japan) * US maxi-CD single # "I Can't Dance" (LP version) – 4:00 # "On the Shoreline" – 4:45 # "In Too Deep" (live) – 5:28 # "That's All" (live) – 4:54 # "I Can't Dance" (sex mix) – 6:59 == Personnel == * Tony Banks – keyboards * Phil Collins – vocals, drums, drum machine * Mike Rutherford – electric guitars, bass guitar ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1992) Peak position Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 8 Europe (European Dance Radio) 24 Italy (Musica e dischi) 10 Portugal (AFP) 3 US Cash Box Top 100 3 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1992) Position Australia (ARIA) 67 Austria (Ö3 Austria Top 40) 14 Belgium (Ultratop) 12 Canada Top Singles (RPM) 27 Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 20 Germany (Official German Charts) 24 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 16 Netherlands (Single Top 100) 20 Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) 32 UK Singles (OCC) 74 US Billboard Hot 100 55 US (Joel Whitburn's Pop Annual) 54 ===Certifications=== ==Covers== In the 1990s, "Weird Al" Yankovic created a parody of the video for "I Can't Dance" for his series Al TV, in which he appeared alongside the band.

40504302	I Can't Change the World	"I Can't Change the World" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Brad Paisley. It was released in August 2013 as the third single from his ninth studio album, Wheelhouse. Paisley co-wrote the song with Chris DuBois and Kelley Lovelace. In August 2013, Paisley announced plans to film a movie based on the song. ==Background== According to Paisley, the song's message is that "as messed up as this world feels, changing one person’s life makes yours worthwhile". He goes on saying that one of his favorite lines of the song is "so let Jesus look down on this mess / and let the powers that be just fuss and fight". The song was one of the first that was cut for the album and it was an up-tempo: "it didn’t have much magic that way. It had power, but no magic”. Paisley added that the song "is very important. It’s a really timely love song". He adds that "it wouldn’t have worked 30 years ago as well as it will now. It’s written for the time we live in. Technology, instead of connecting us, it starts to separate us”. ==Critical reception== Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song four stars out of five, writing that it is "a compelling piece of production because it’s both sparse and vulnerable, as well as textured and complicated." Michael Sudhalter of Roughstock gave the song three stars out of five, saying that Paisley "delivers it with some good acoustic guitar, strong vocals and a nice, slow melody […] even if it's not as profound as the title suggests." ==Chart performance== "I Can't Change the World" debuted at number 60 on the U.S. Billboard Country Airplay chart for the week of August 24, 2013. It also debuted at number 48 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of September 14, 2013.

The style and approach to this album has given the lyrics more > breathing space and room for exploration, hence it resulting in something > more of a rap album with an electronic edge, as opposed to ‘Dance Music’ > with raps on it.” Speaking about the album's second single "Choosing For You", Metropolis told Rolling Stone “We kinda pieced together ideas from two beats Noisia had made to put this one together, I think it's the only track with a Noisia voice on it... The track is about letting the music possess you, as good music should when you hear it.” ==Marketing== ===Singles=== *"Make Those Move" is the album's lead single.

Clash said the following about the album: > Banking on the success of 2009’s enormous track ‘Contact’ and other atom > splits means a protracted patent of rap and rucking risks running thin. The > Beggars’ Orifice Vulgatron and Metropolis, MCs both, purge that possibility, > staying as seven-figure showmen you hope never take responsibility, as > ‘Foil’ appears dangerously close to doing.

4070955	I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)	"I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)" () is a duet by Italian singer Eros Ramazzotti and American singer Anastacia, released as the second single from Ramazzotti's eleventh studio album, Calma apparente (2005), and the third from Anastacia's first greatest hits album, Pieces of a Dream (2005). It was met with commercial success in mainland Europe, particularly Germany, peaking at number one and becoming the ninth-biggest-selling song of 2006. It also topped the singles charts in Italy and Switzerland and peaked within the top five in several other countries. The song is a ballad in which Anastacia sings in English and Ramazzotti in Italian or Spanish. As Ramazzotti records his songs in both Italian and Spanish, there are two versions of this song as well: the original one with Italian lyrics and the other with Spanish lyrics, entitled "I Belong to You (El ritmo de la pasión)", which is available on the Spanish versions of both Ramazzotti's and Anastacia's albums. ==Critical reception== While reviewing Anastacia's Pieces of a Dream compilation, Lisa Haines of BBC Music referred to the song as "a gorgeous duet with Eros Ramazzotti which reveals a silkier side to the hard edge normally so distinctive in her voice, and ends with the kind of lung excess that would put Celine Dion to shame." ==Music video== The music video was directed by Don Allan and was filmed in Rome, Italy, on 21–22 November 2005. In the video, Ramazzotti and Anastacia play a romantic couple. ==Track listings== European CD single # "I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)" # "I Belong to You (El Ritmo de la Pasión)" European maxi-CD single # "I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)" # "I Belong to You (El Ritmo de la Pasión)" # "I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)" (video) # "I Belong to You (El Ritmo de la Pasión)" (video) ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2006) Peak position Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 3 Chart (2008) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2006) Rank Austria (Ö3 Austria Top 40) 6 Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) 9 Belgium (Ultratop 50 Wallonia) 16 Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 17 Germany (Official German Charts) 9 Hungary (Rádiós Top 40) 39 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 27 Netherlands (Single Top 100) 26 Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) 5 ==Certifications== ==Release history== Region Date Format(s) Label(s) Europe 20 January 2006 CD 27 January 2006 Maxi-CD ==References== Category:2000s ballads Category:2005 songs Category:2006 singles Category:Anastacia songs Category:Eros Ramazzotti songs Category:Macaronic songs Category:Male–female vocal duets Category:Number-one singles in Germany Category:Number-one singles in Italy Category:Number-one singles in Switzerland Category:Songs written by Anastacia Category:Songs written by Claudio Guidetti Category:Songs written by Eros Ramazzotti Category:Songs written by Kara DioGuardi

409741	I Am – Somebody	"I Am – Somebody" is a poem often recited by Reverend Jesse Jackson, and was used as part of PUSH-Excel, a program designed to motivate black students.The Reader's Companion to American History college.hmco.com by Clayborne Carson (archived) A similar poem was written in the early 1940s by Reverend William Holmes Borders, Sr., senior pastor at the Greater Wheat Street Baptist Church and civil rights activist in Atlanta, Georgia. == History == A recording of Jackson delivering the poem appears on the album I Am Somebody published on Respect Records TAS-2601 in 1971.Discogs "Rev. Jesse Jackson – I Am Somebody" Jackson recited the free verse poem on Sesame Street in 1972 (taped in February, aired in May). It was geared to fulfilling Sesame Street’s initial curriculum for serving under-privileged city children, as well as promoting cultural understanding. On Sesame Street, lines of "I am/Somebody" or "But I am/Somebody" were recited in a call and response fashion by Jackson and the children. During the segment, children of multiple races were gathered on the Sesame Street set and led by Jackson in the poem. This performance is included on the 2006 DVD release Sesame Street: Old School 1969–1974. "I Am – Somebody" was also recited by Jackson, with the assembled crowd at Los Angeles Coliseum for the famous Wattstax Music Festival on August 20, 1972.Speakola "Jesse Jackson: 'I Am Somebody', Wattstax Music Festival - 1972" It also appears in When We Were Kings, a 1996 documentary examining the historic 1974 Rumble in the Jungle boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (which was still known as Zaire at that time). It was performed with band as part of a concert preceding the bout that was said to be the finest collection of African American entertainers ever assembled at that time. The poem inspired the title of a 1998 book called I Am Somebody! () by Charnan Simon, but did not print the poem itself. ==Legacy== About a month after Dr. Seuss died in 1991, Saturday Night Live paid tribute to the book Green Eggs and Ham, by having Jackson appear on the "Weekend Update" segment and recite it in the same oratative fashion he performs the poem. The poem was recited in a somewhat different form in what sounds like a speech by Jackson sampled on the 1973 funk single "Same Beat" by The J.B.'s. The J.B.'s titled an album and track Damn Right I Am Somebody the following year. The phrase has become so much of a calling card for Jackson that he yells it in a cameo in the movie Undercover Brother. "I Am – Somebody" also inspired a similarly titled song on Carlos Santana's 2005 album, "All That I Am", which featured the American rapper will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas. "I Am Somebody" is a song by the hip-hop group Jurassic 5 on the album Power In Numbers, which samples the poem numerous times. A recording of "I Am – Somebody" is on the song "Can't Hold Us Back" on Paris Presents: Hard Truth Soldiers by Dead Prez, Kam, Paris and Public Enemy. Primal Scream sampled the Wattstax concert speech heavily for the track "Come Together" on their 1991 album Screamadelica. ==References== Category:American poems Category:1971 poems Category:African-American poetry Category:Jesse Jackson
4097790	I Am the Resurrection (album)	I Am the Resurrection: A Tribute to John Fahey is a tribute album to guitarist John Fahey released in 2006. The album's title is taken from the title of the third track of his album The Transfiguration of Blind Joe Death. ==History== Co-produced by Stephen Brower and M. Ward, I Am the Resurrection was the first John Fahey tribute album released after his death. Brower related, "We wanted to go after people who we thought wouldn't do traditional renderings of his stuff." ==Reception== I Am the Resurrection received mixed reviews upon its release, although most were favorable or equivocal. In his Allmusic review, critic Alex Henderson noted the "interesting thing about this Fahey tribute compilation is the fact that it isn't dominated by fingerpickers and Fahey disciples." and "this compilation wasn't assembled with purists in mind." He called the disc a bit uneven but it "is full of pleasant surprises and is a memorable demonstration of the fact that Fahey's compositions can be useful well beyond the fingerpicker field." Erik Davis of Blender gave the tribute album five of five stars and stated "For once, the motley character of most tribute records fits the subject." John Metzger of The Music Box felt "there’s nothing on I Am the Resurrection that is anywhere near as groundbreaking or strange as Fahey’s own recordings. Yet, what the performers accomplish is still strikingly potent." Steve Horowitz praised the album, writing it is "hard to resist pushing the replay button and listening to [each song] again before going on to the next song. That’s true of every tune on this disc, which is a fine tribute to one of America’s most remarkable artists." In his review for Pitchfork Media, Matthew Murphy praised some artist's appearances while noting less success for others. Murphy called Sufjan Stevens contribution "typically fussy" and an "ill match for the contours" of Fahey's music and M. Ward's rendition "falls completely flat." Equally mixed was Andrew Gerig's review for Stylus magazine that "the tribute disc is only for Fahey diehards" and that too many of the artists "hold back." In his review of The Great Koonaklaster Speaks: A John Fahey Celebration, Grayson Currin called I Am the Resurrection "the first... and the biggest failure" of the Fahey tribute albums... to think that I Am the Resurrection's alternately self- involved (Stevens) or irreverently unimaginative (Peter Case) interpretations gave newcomers invalid impressions of Fahey's catalogue is, really, a bit frightening." ==Track listing== All songs by John Fahey unless otherwise noted. ==Personnel== *Joey Burns – vocals, guitar, upright bass *Sufjan Stevens – vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, banjo, flute, recorder, oboe, drums, shaker, triangle, percussion *Kevin Barker – vocals, electric guitar, recorder, percussion *David Immerglück – guitar *Jack Rose – guitar *Lee Ranaldo – guitar *M.

41074150	I Am Malala	I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and was Shot by the Taliban is an autobiographical book by Malala Yousafzai, co-written with Christina Lamb. It was published on 8 October 2013, by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK and Little, Brown and Company in the US. The book details the early life of Yousafzai, her father's ownership of schools and activism, the rise and fall of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in Swat Valley and the assassination attempt made against Yousafzai on 9 October 2012, when she was aged 15, following her activism for female education. It received a positive critical reception and won several awards, though it has been banned in many schools in Pakistan. ==Synopsis== Part One covers Malala Yousafzai's life "Before the Taliban". She describes her childhood home Swat Valley. Named for Malalai of Maiwand, Yousafzai lived with her father Ziauddin, her mother Toor Pekai and two younger brothers Khushal and Atal. Ziauddin's father Rohul Amin was an imam and a teacher. Ziauddin studied a Master's in English at Jehanzeb College. He opened the Khushal School with a partner Naeem, who later left due to financial difficulties. Ziauddin found a new partner Hidayatullah, with whom the school slowly began to make a profit. As Ziauddin began to open more schools, Toor Pekai would bring children in need to live with them and Ziauddin would give free places in his schools to poor children. Yousafzai describes the changing political regimes in Pakistan, the first drone strikes in Pakistan in 2004 following the September 11 attacks. Part Two, "The Valley of Death", details the rise of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in Swat. In 2006, Fazlullah began a popular "Radio Mullah" broadcast which initially gave advice on such matters as ritual ablutions and drug abstinence, but progressed into the condemnation of music and dancing, and instruction on women staying in the home. The book also describes the continuing War in North-West Pakistan, and the return of Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan which culminated in her assassination. The Taliban began to commit further murders such as that of Shabana, and Ziauddin Yousafzai continued outspoken activism. During the First Battle of Swat, Malala begins to write a BBC Urdu blog under the pseudonym "Gul Mukai". Her school is shut down following a Taliban edict in 2009, and her family are forced to move to Shangla for three months. Part Three is entitled "Three Bullets, Three Girls". By August 2009, the army have fought off the Taliban in Swat, and the Yousafzai family return. Malala's school re- opens, and she visits Islamabad with school friends, meeting with Major General Athar Abbas and giving a public speech. With her father, Yousafzai speaks at many interviews, critical of the Taliban and the army's ineffectiveness. The 2010 Pakistan floods devastate Swat, destroying buildings and leaving many without food, clean water and electricity. In the rest of the country, CIA agent Raymond Davis murders two men and the Americans kill bin Laden, leading to widespread mistrust of American influence in Pakistan by the public. In late 2011, Yousafzai begins to receive prizes for her activism. She travels to Karachi to talk to Geo TV, also visiting the mausoleum of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Yousafzai receives death threats, which worries her parents. Following the shooting of Zahid Khan in August 2012, Ziauddin expected to be targeted next. Malala also begins to fear an attack on her. She revises hard for her exams, staying up late at night. After her Pakistan Studies paper on 9 October, two men stop her bus and come aboard. One shouts "Who is Malala?" and shoots three bullets. Part Four is named "Between Life and Death". One bullet travelled from Yousafzai's left eye to her shoulder, and her friends Shazia and Kainat were also non-fatally injured. Yousafzai's father gave a speech with the Association of Private Schools before rushing to the hospital, while Yousafzai's mother was learning to read and rushed home to pray. Malala was taken by helicopter to the Combined Military Hospital in Peshawar and then airlifted to a military hospital in Rawalpindi. Yousafzai was taken on 15 October to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, aboard a United Arab Emirates jet, but her father refused to come as the rest of the family could not travel without passports. Part Five is called "A Second Life". Yousafzai woke up in Birmingham on 16 October, and spent the following days obsessed with the location of her father, and not being able to afford medical treatment, though the Pakistani government was covering costs. Yousafzai received 8000 cards and many presents. When she awoke, she was confused about all the cards she had received, as there was supposed to be a news blackout in Pakistan so no one would know anything had happened to her or where she was being taken, but someone had seen her being flown out to the UK, and word got around quickly. Her family finally arrived on 25 October. The day her family got to the hospital was also the first day since arriving in Birmingham that she had any access to windows. Malala had not seen the city she was being kept in for 10 days. She underwent surgery on 11 November to repair her facial nerve; in January 2013, she was discharged, and in February she received surgery to get a cochlear implant. Yousafzai lives in Birmingham, though she misses Swat, and plans to continue her activism so she can be known not as "the girl who was shot by the Taliban" but as "the girl who fought for education". ==Reception== According to Publishers Weekly, in 2017 the book had sold almost 2 million copies, and there were 750,000 copies of the children's edition in print. In March 2018, The Bookseller reported that 328,000 copies of the book had been sold in the UK, netting over £2.47 million. ===Accolades=== *2013 Specsavers National Book Awards, Popular Non-Fiction Book of the Year *2013 Goodreads Choice Awards, Best Memoir & Autobiography *2014 Political Book Awards, Finalist, Political Book of the Year ===Critical reviews=== Sayeeda Warsi, writing for The Daily Telegraph, giving the book four stars out of five, wrote "Malala has turned a tragedy into something positive". Entertainment Weekly gave the book a "B+", writing "Malala's bravely eager voice can seem a little thin here, in I Am Malala, likely thanks to her co-writer, but her powerful message remains undiluted." Metro list the book as one of the "20 best non-fiction books of 2013", praising that Yousafzai's story is "one of idealism and stubborn courage". In The Observer, the reviewer Yvonne Roberts praised Lamb for ensuring "the teenager's voice is never lost", and summarises that "this extraordinary schoolgirl's words are a reminder of all that is best in human nature". Fatima Bhutto in The Guardian called the book "fearless" and stated that "the haters and conspiracy theorists would do well to read this book", though she criticised "the stiff, know-it-all voice of a foreign correspondent" that is interwoven with Yousafzai's. In The Spectator, the journalist Owen Bennett-Jones describes Yousafzai's story as "astonishing", and writes that "as the story progresses, Malala’s voice definitely cuts through, clear and defiant". Marie Arana in The Washington Post called the book "riveting" and wrote "It is difficult to imagine a chronicle of a war more moving, apart from perhaps the diary of Anne Frank." ===Response in Pakistan=== The All Pakistan Private School's Federation announced that the book would be banned in its 152,000 member institutions, stating that it disrespected Islam and could have a "negative" influence. Pakistani investigative editor Ansar Abbasi described her work as "providing her critics something 'concrete' to prove her as an 'agent' of the West against Islam and Pakistan". Following the book's release, the Pakistani Taliban released a statement threatening to kill Yousafzai, and target bookshops which sell the book. The book, however, continues to be available in leading bookstores. It remains a popular reading among educated people especially young girls. Some schools, in fact, encourage students to read this book by keeping it in their libraries. Pakistan does not have high literacy rate, and therefore, the popularity or otherwise of any literature is always subject to how the educated people have received it. ==Release details== I Am Malala was published on 8 October 2013, by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK and Little, Brown and Company in the US. The book has been translated into more than 40 languages. A children's edition of the memoir was published in 2014 under the title I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World. The audio book edition, narrated by Neela Vaswani, won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Children's Album. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Malala Yousafzai Category:2013 non-fiction books Category:Pakistani autobiographies Category:Autobiographical novels Category:Political autobiographies Category:Books about politics of Pakistan Category:Books about activism Category:Books about terrorism Category:Collaborative non-fiction books Category:Obscenity controversies in literature Category:Censored books Category:Islam-related controversies in Asia Category:Weidenfeld & Nicolson books Category:Little, Brown and Company books

41254977	I Can See You (film)	I Can See You is a 2008 American psychological horror film written and directed by Graham Reznick. Ben Dickinson, Christopher Ford, and Duncan Skiles star as advertising workers who go on a camping trip to find inspiration for their latest campaign, only to find their sanity tested in the woods. == Plot == In an infomercial, Mickey Hauser, a spokesperson for Clara Clean Corporation, advertises Claractix, a cleaning product. Ben Richards attempts to finish a portrait of a man in a suit, but he can not visualize the face, which remains blank. After several attempts, he gives up and shaves off his beard. When he meets with his coworkers, radio and newspaper reports reveal that Hauser has died and that Clara Clean Corporation has become involved in an ecological scandal. Richards and his coworkers have been recruited to come up with an ecologically-themed advertising campaign to counter this scandal, but Doug Quaid rejects all of John Kimble's stock photography. Ben suggests that they go to a Delaware campsite to seek inspiration and take their own photographs. Meanwhile, Sonia Roja's boss tells her that her boyfriend, Kimble, has one week to come up with a fantastic advertising campaign. Unless it is fantastic, Roja will take the fall. Quaid, too, feverishly repeats that the campaign must be fantastic. Richards, Quaid, Kimble, and Roja set off for the campsite. On the way, Kimble receives a phone call from Ivan, who invites them to a barbecue. Kimble tells Richards that a mysterious person will be there along with them, though he refuses to reveal who. When they arrive, Quaid unsuccessfully flirts with Roja, who is more interested in her cell phone than him, and Richards takes some photographs, all of which come out distorted. At Ivan's barbecue, Richards sees Summer Day, an acquaintance upon whom he once had a crush. Encouraged by Quaid, Richards approaches her, and they embrace. Richards and Day go off into the woods on their own and have sex, though Richards later denies to Quaid that they had sex. The next day, Richards and Day go swimming. Quaid teases Richards about going into the water with his glasses on, and Richards removes his glasses, which leaves his vision blurred and unfocused. In the water, Richards fumbles in conversation with Day, and she wanders off into the wilderness with Quaid. Kimble dismisses Richards' concerns when Quaid and Day do not return, and Roja denies Kimble's insistence that something is bothering her. Kimble encourages Richards to take more photographs, but they turn out to be similarly distorted. Hauser critiques Richards' photography and suggests that his camera's lens may need cleaning. Disturbed by the camera's malfunction and his hallucination, Richards returns to camp and recruits a reluctant Kimble to search for Quaid and Day. The two wander through the forest, where they find Day's underwear, blood on a rock, and a memory card; however, they locate no sign of Quaid or Day. They give up and head back to the camp. While viewing the images on the memory card, Kimble's laptop malfunctions, and the images are destroyed. Roja complains of hearing voices and eerie sounds in the forest, but Kimble reacts skeptically, and they all go to sleep. Richards has a strange dream or vision involving a musical number performed by Quaid and Day. When he awakens, Quaid has returned to the camp, disoriented and manic. Roja watches over Quaid as Kimble and Richards check the camp; disturbed by Quaid's behavior, Roja calls for assistance, and Quaid bolts into the forest. Richards chases after Quaid, and, in the light, finds blood on Quaid's hands. Quaid runs off again, and Richards finds his body at the bottom of a cliff. Hauser appears and tells Richards to take a second look at the cliff, this time without his glasses; he does and throws his glasses over the edge. He is then approached by a corpse- like Day, upon whom he can not focus. Richards hallucinates extensively, and, upon returning to the camp, he discovers that Kimble has murdered Roja. Richards puts out Kimble's eyes, opens his skull, and extracts a serrated knife from Kimble's head. He hallucinates further and cuts out the face from his father's portrait. == Cast == Many of the characters' names are the same as characters in Arnold Schwarzenegger films The Running Man, Total Recall, Kindergarten Cop, and Red Sonja. == Production == Director Graham Reznick originally worked as a sound designer, recordist, and assistant director for Ti West, who is a childhood friend. The Viewer, a short film that is included with the DVD release of I Can See You was intended to be an introduction to Reznick's experimental, surrealistic style. Videodrome was a big influence on Reznick, and the final scenes in I Can See You are inspired by that film. The film came from an idea that West and he had: both would write and direct a film about a group of people who go into the woods. Reznick focused on the experimental qualities of the film, as he knew that he would not be given as much freedom on future projects. == Release == After its initial, limited theatrical release distributed by Cinema Purgatorio, I Can See You was picked up for VOD and DVD by Kino International. The film was released on DVD on October 27, 2009. == Reception == Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 100% of five surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 7.5/10. Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated the film 3/5 stars and called it "one of the most indefinable films I think I’ve ever seen." Nathan Lee of The New York Times wrote, "David Lynch is the key influence here, and Mr. Reznick proves himself a keen disciple of the master. I Can See You heralds a splendid new filmmaker with one eye on genre mechanics, one eye on avant-garde conceits and a third eye for transcendental weirdness." Samuel Zimmerman of Fangoria rated it 3.5/4 stars and called it "without a doubt one of the most intriguing and well-crafted low-budget horror films in recent memory." Steve Ericson of Baltimore City Paper wrote that I Can See You is "a horror film that succeeds on its own terms, rather than looking like a bid to direct a Saw sequel. I Can See You is a true adventure: Reznick has gone into the wilderness and come back with an extremely promising feature debut." Andrew O'Heir of Salon wrote that the film "goes from comic- realistic mode into full-on psycho meltdown with more terrifying adroitness than any other movie of this decade. Just out on DVD. See. It. Now." Ronny Scheib of Variety wrote, "Atmospheric audio fills each leaf and branch with nameless menace, while superimpositions and slow dissolves trace a psychological slide toward disintegration." Scheib states that the film could develop a cult following. Nicolas Rapold of The Village Voice wrote, "So much about this movie and its characters should be annoying, but the sensory disorientation climaxes in a freakout that wipes all your troubles away, as well as anything else lying around in your head." == References == == External links == * * Category:2008 films Category:2008 horror films Category:American independent films Category:American psychological horror films Category:Films set in New York (state) Category:Films set in Delaware Category:2008 directorial debut films Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s American films
41367093	I (cuneiform)	240px|left|thumb|Cuneiform sign i (used in many languages). The cuneiform i sign is a common use vowel sign. It can be found in many languages, examples being the Akkadian language of the Epic of Gilgamesh (hundreds of years, parts of millenniums) and the mid 14th-century BC Amarna letters; also the Hittite language-(see table of Hittite cuneiform signs below). In the Epic of Gilgamesh it also has a minor usage as a sumerogram, I. The usage numbers from the Epic are as follows: i-(698), I-(1).Parpola, 1971. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Sign List, pp. 155-165, no. 142, p. 158. As i and one of the four vowels in Akkadian (there is no "o"), scribes can easily use one sign (a vowel, or a syllable with a vowel) to substitute one vowel for another. In the Amarna letters, the segue adverb "now", or "now, at this time", Akkadian language 'enūma',Parpola, 1971. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Glossary, pp. 119-145, enūma, p. 122. is seldom spelled with the 'e'; instead its spellings are typically: anūma, inūma, and sometimes enūma. In both the Amarna letters and the Epic of Gilgamesh another common use of the "i" sign is for the preposition, Akkadian language ina, spelled i-na, for in, into, for, etc.. (There is an alternate cuneiform sign for ina (cuneiform), a sub-variety use of aš (cuneiform), the single, horizontal stroke.) ==References== *Moran, William L. 1987, 1992. The Amarna Letters.

41384065	I Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.)	I Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (Territorial Force), along with its sister II Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.), was a horse artillery brigade of the Territorial Force that was formed in September 1914 for the 2nd Mounted Division at the start of World War I. The brigade moved to Egypt with the division in April 1915 and remained there when the bulk of the division went to Gallipoli in August 1915. It was once more part of the 2nd Mounted Division from December 1915 but was broken up in January 1916 when the division was dissolved. ==History== ===Formation=== A decision was made to form a new mounted division from the mounted brigades in and around the Churn area of Berkshire. On 2 September 1914, 2nd Mounted Division, with Headquarters at Goring, came into being with three mounted brigades transferred from 1st Mounted Division (1st South Midland Mounted Brigade at Newbury, 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade at Churn and the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade at South Stoke) and the London Mounted Brigade at Streatley. The brigades were relatively widely dispersed to allow an adequate water supply for the horses and to provide sufficient training areas. Each of the four mounted brigades include a horse artillery battery of four Ehrhardt 15-pounder guns. On 2 September 1914, I Brigade RHA (T.F.) was formed at Churn with Warwickshire Battery, RHA, late of the 1st South Midland Mounted Brigade. On the same date, II Brigade RHA (T.F.) was also formed at Churn with Berkshire and Nottinghamshire Batteries, RHA and A and B Batteries, HAC. ===Active service=== On 1 November, Warwickshire Battery was posted to France: the first Territorial Force artillery battery to go on active service. It was replaced in the brigade by B Battery, HAC from II Brigade, RHA (T.F.). In November 1914, the division moved to Norfolk on coastal defence duties. Artillery headquarters was established at Cromer, before joining the divisional headquarters at Hanworth in December, and the battery was at Gayton (1st South Midland Mounted Brigade was at King's Lynn). In March 1915, the division was put on warning for overseas service. In early April, the division starting leaving Avonmouth and the last elements landed at Alexandria before the end of the month. By the middle of May, the horse artillery batteries were near Ismaïlia on Suez Canal Defences. On 14 July 1915, B Battery, HAC (along with Berkshire, RHA of II Brigade) left for Aden. They fought a sharp action at Sheikh Othman on 20 July, that removed the Turkish threat to Aden for the rest of the war, before returning to Egypt. On 10 August 1915, the division was reorganized as a dismounted formation in preparation for service at Gallipoli. Each Yeomanry Regiment left a squadron headquarters and two troops (about 100 officers and men) in Egypt to look after the horses. The artillery batteries and ammunition columns, signal troops, mobile veterinary sections, Mounted Brigade Transport and Supply Columns and two of the Field Ambulances were also left behind in Egypt. The 2nd Mounted Division returned from Gallipoli in December 1915 and was reformed and remounted. On 13 December 1915, B Battery, HAC rejoined the brigade from Suez Canal Defences and on 20 December 1915, A Battery, HAC joined from II Brigade. However, the dismemberment of the division began almost immediately as units were posted to the Western Frontier Force or to various other commands. On 21 January 1916, A and B Batteries, HAC left to join the Suez Canal Defences and the brigade HQ was disbanded; 2nd Mounted Division was disbanded on the same day. ==See also== ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * ==External links== *The Royal Horse Artillery on The Long, Long Trail *The Great War Royal Horse Artillery Category:Royal Horse Artillery brigades Category:Artillery units and formations of World War I Category:Military units and formations established in 1914 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1916
41404321	I Confess (magazine)	I Confess was an American biweekly pulp magazine aimed at young women readers that was published between 1922 and 1932 by Dell Publishing. The magazine contained stories that were marketed as being true first-person accounts of mostly middle-class women’s lives and scandals told in a confessional style, which was different from many other pulp magazines which were mainly marketed as cheap fictional magazines. It was the first magazine and title ever published by Dell, and its popularity helped launch over 700 magazine titles, making Dell Publishing the successful publishing house that it remains today.Charles Laughlin, "Dell Books: 1943-Present." Mass Market Publishing In America. Ed. Allen Billy Crider. Boston: G.K. Hall & Co., 1982. p92-106 ==The Launch of Dell Publishing== George T. Delacorte, Jr. founded Dell Publishing in 1921 after many years of working in the magazine publishing business, his last position being that of Advertising Director for Snappy Stories. He started out in one room in the Masonic Temple Building on West 23rd Street in New York, with only himself and two employees."George T. Delacorte: 1893-1991." New York Community Trust. 2008 I Confess, introduced as a bi- weekly magazine (on newsstands every other Friday) in 1922, was their first title, and it is considered one of the many imitation ‘Girlie Pulps’ launched due to the success of Snappy Stories (1912-1933) and was inspired by Bernarr McFadden’s magazine True Story, considered the first confessional magazine, which started in 1919 and is still published monthly.Beau Collier, "Birth of the Girlie Pulps." The Pulp Magazines Project.Lauren Gibson, "Newsstand: 1925: I Confess." The 1925 Virtual Newsstand. University of Western Florida. The format of Snappy Stories which was the standard for the ‘Girlie Pulp’ genre included stories of scandals and sex, and was meant to attract a mostly female readership due to the racy and intriguing pin-up style art found on the cover. I Confess was edited by Elizabeth Sharp, who influenced the tone of the magazine and chose which "true life submissions" were "clean" enough to be printed in the magazine. Because Delacorte "aimed the Dell magazines at the lower middle class audiences rather than at the upper middle-class readers of McCall’s and Ladies Home Journal",William H. Lyles, Putting Dell on the Map. Westport: Greenwood Press, 1983. p4 I Confess cost only ten cents a copy at first publication, although one year after its first issue, in 1923, the price rose to fifteen cents each ($3.00 for a yearly subscription).I Confess. The price of I Confess was relatively inexpensive when compared to its inspiration and competitor, True Story, which was 25 cents per copy in 1921. Dell Publishing relied on newsstand sales of its magazines rather than profit from advertisements within its titles, and so its inexpensive price and mass appeal ensured that I Confess achieved success at the newsstand.Cult Magazines A to Z: A Compendium of Culturally Obsessive & Curiously Expressive Publications. Eds. Earl Kemp and Luis Ortiz. New York: Nonstop Press, 2009. p30 Additionally, Dell Publishing numbered the covers of I Confess, like all of its magazines, instead of printing the dates, as it was easier to re-sell unsold copies if a cover date did not advertise it as an old issue. Dell Publishing "first put them on sale east of the Rocky Mountains and south of Canada. If an issue did not sell, [Delacorte] just trimmed the edges of the unsold copies and attempted to re-sell them, this time west of the Rocky Mountains and in Canada."Lauren Gibson, "I Confess ." The Pulp Magazines Project. Circulation varied quite a bit from year to year; by 1926 it reached a circulation of 160,041, and in 1927 circulation became 144,393 for the year. ==Content== I Confess had collections of "true life stories" in each number written in various ways. There were serialized stories with cliff-hangers, stand-alone tales, articles on "celebrity encounters," and interviews, and a recurring expert advice column that encouraged women to write to the "Trouble Doctor" in "Tell Your Troubles to the Trouble Doctor’s Department", where women asked for relationship advice. The magazine also encouraged further participation in addition to asking readers to submit their confessions by hosting numerous prize contests. All stories were given the pretence of being true-to-life stories, written by real women, especially in the beginning of the magazine’s production, when it advertised that all stories were truthfully told. Elizabeth Sharp, editor of I Confess, was interested in only showing sympathetic characters whose stories contained "clean content", with no sexually explicit content. However, although the content may have not been as risqué as other magazines, there were many progressive aspects to this magazine which featured stories for middle- and lower-class women, was about mostly lower-middle-class women, and was edited by a woman. Stories about wives standing up to abusive husbands, women who worked for a living, and women taking on masculine roles (or even disguising as men) were common. Examples of I Confess’s progressive nature were revealed in the advice given in the recurring "Trouble Doctor" section: :Question- I am a girl nineteen years of age. My mother died when I was twelve years old, so I have just been knocked from pillar to post ever since, with no one to care for me. But three years ago I met a wealthy young fellow, four years my senior, and fell in love with him. I am not happy, although he gives me everything a girl could wish for and is very good to me. He has promised to marry me several times, but when the time comes he never mentions it, and seems that I can’t stand it any longer this way. But I don’t want to give him up. So please tell me what to do, for I am so very distressed. – Unhappy. :Answer- Learn how to support yourself. In doing so you will come in contact with other people, and the chances are that in time this man will seem less necessary to you. As it is, it looks as if you are mortgaging your future for the sake of a doubtful present happiness. You are so young that you should have all sorts of possibilities if you work now to make your future what you want. If you can bring yourself to break with this man, it will be for the best. And sometimes a man will marry a girl who comes from a different station of life, if it’s a question of marriage or losing her. That had better be your attitude, anyhow."Tell Your Troubles to the Trouble Doctor’s Department." I Confess . 12 Jan 1923: p60 The advertisements in I Confess reflected their progressive nature as well; while most were fairly standard for pulp magazines of the era, ranging from ads for psychics, Christmas gifts, and cosmetics, in the January 12, 1923 (No. 25) issue there was an advertisement for Margaret Sanger’s Woman and the New Race which encouraged both men and women to read about their options for birth control. This ad targeted married readers who already had multiple children and encouraged them to purchase a copy to learn more about Margaret Sanger’s progressive views on birth control. Despite Sharp’s attempts to create a less explicit magazine than other girlie pulps on the market, many readers still considered I Confess to be distasteful. In 1925 during an effort by Postmaster General Harry S. New to crack down on magazines’ content using postal obscenity laws, I Confess was identified as one of the magazines many thought objectionable and some thought it in danger of being banned. Its existence, however, was defended by Oswald Garrison Villard, who stated: :It is better that Love Stories, I Confess, and Art Lovers should run their course than that a permanent censorship should be fastened upon the country, which could so easily be extended to cover opinions and political doctrines in addition to racy stories and suggestive pictures.Paul S. Boyer, Purity in Print: Book Censorship in America from the Gilded Age to the Computer Age 2nd ed. Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 2002. p157 ==Ghostwriters== Despite the claims of I Confess, subtitled "A Magazine of Personal Experiences", that its stories were written by real women about real experiences, evidence indicates that many of the stories were fictional and that Dell Publishing paid male writers to create stories for the publication. Pulp novelist Jack Woodford, in his famous autobiographical novel Trial and Error, confessed to having been hired to write "confessions" for I Confess, in addition to writing for multiple other confessional-style magazines: :I have also written true confession stories for True Confession Stories Magazine, I Confess Magazine, and several other confession story magazines. Of the editor, or past editor of I Confess Magazine I know a peach of a story, and whether or not it is true, it is still a good story, and well illustrates a confession magazine point. :A writer friend of mine who was in New York temporarily, feeding liquor to editors in the hope of getting more acceptances when he went back home (a sound policy), dropped in to see the lady editor of I Confess Magazine. My writer friend is an ingratiating person and so is the lady who then was editor of I Confess Magazine. They got along splendidly from the start, and were chatting enjoyably when an office girl entered to announce that a certain writer (male) who specializes in confession stories had arrived for a consultation with the editor. The editor of I Confess Magazine, according to my writer friend, exclaimed in annoyance and petulance at thus being disturbed: :"Christ! There’s that darned unwed mother come to see me again. I’m sorry; we’ll have to cut our chat short."Jack Woodford. Trial and Error. Menlo Park, CA: Askmar Publishing. 2012. This story, presumably about Elizabeth Sharp, the "lady editor", shows how more than one male writer was hired to write fake women’s confessions for I Confess. Additionally, Woodford gives a detailed "how-to" on the stock format of writing articles for confessional magazines. ==Impact== While never reaching the same popularity and circulation as its predecessor and inspiration True Story, I Confess did have an impact of its own. It remains a notable example of 1920s women’s confessional writing, and as it targeted lower-middle-class women, it has a large selection of stories that focus on the lives of women from all backgrounds of life. Jack Woodford’s exposé of I Confess (and other confessional magazines of the era) helped Trial and Error to become immensely popular, and his directions on the "formula" for ghostwriting a confessional story inspired many novelists. Furthermore, the success of I Confess as the very first publication by Dell Publishing meant that Delacorte was free to create the Dell Magazines brand, which went on to publish over 700 magazines such as Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, Asimov's Science Fiction, and, most notably, Astounding Stories, later renamed Analog Science Fiction and Fact, which is still printed today and is the longest continuously published science fiction magazine. ==References== Category:1922 establishments in New York (state) Category:1932 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:Biweekly magazines published in the United States Category:Defunct women's magazines published in the United States Category:English-language magazines Category:Magazines established in 1922 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1932 Category:Magazines published in New York City Category:Pulp magazines

41510213	I Am (Leona Lewis album)	I Am is the fifth studio album by English singer Leona Lewis. It was released on 11 September 2015, by Island Records after Lewis took leave from Syco Music in June 2014. Recording began in mid 2013, during the production of Lewis's first Christmas album and fourth studio album, Christmas, with Love (2013). Recording sessions resumed in January 2014 with producer Poet, Toby Gad and Wayne Wilkins. I Am is preceded by the release of "Fire Under My Feet" and the album's title track except for in the United States where "Thunder" precedes the album. The album reached top 40 in multiple countries, including US, United Kingdom, Spain and Germany. ==Background== In February 2013, a representative from Syco Music, Lewis' record label, announced that she was about to start writing and recording material "imminently" for her fourth studio album, and that it would be released in late 2013. The news came after Lewis announced that she had parted ways from Modest! Management, the management team who had represented her since she won the third series of The X Factor in 2006. Various media outlets speculated that this was due to the weak commercial performance of her third studio album, Glassheart, which was released in November 2012. It became her first album to not debut at number one or earn platinum certification in the United Kingdom. In August 2013, Lewis confirmed that she was in the process of recording her first Christmas album, and that label boss and friend, Simon Cowell, came up with the idea. Lewis released Christmas, with Love in November 2013; it peaked at number 13 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 27 December 2013, denoting shipments of more than 100,000 copies. ==Development== On 23 September 2013, it was announced that Lewis would make her acting debut in Walking on Sunshine, a 1980s-inspired musical film. In an interview with Digital Spy on 27 November 2013, Lewis confirmed that she would begin official recording sessions for her fifth studio album in January 2014, after she had finished promoting Christmas, with Love. She revealed that during the production of Christmas, with Love in Summer 2013, she had met with some producers to conceptualise a theme for the album, but that the main focus at the time was to compose songs for the Christmas album. With regard to style and composition, Lewis said that 2013 allowed her to become re-inspired; she stated that after recording songs for Walking on Sunshine, she wanted the album to have a 1980s sound. Later, however, after she recorded Motown inspired songs for the Christmas album, it allowed her to "just get out of [her] head and go into something completely different", stating that she is now leaning towards a "retro throwback sound" as a possible theme for the album. On 3 June 2014, it was announced that Lewis had parted ways with her record label of seven years, Syco Music. Label boss and mentor Simon Cowell tweeted: "Congratulations Leona. We had 7 great years together and now wish you all the best for the future. You put X Factor on the map." Lewis confirmed that she had signed a new contract in the United Kingdom with rival record company Island Records, a division of the Universal Music Group. On joining the label, Lewis said: "After seven incredible years at Sony I feel honoured to be given the opportunity to sign to perhaps the most iconic label of all, Island Records." Lewis later revealed that her departure from Syco had come after "several years" of consideration. She also stated that when she expressed her desire to part with the label she was threatened that the public would be told she had been dropped by the label. However, further creative differences in relation to her fifth studio album finally caused Lewis to leave the label. Of her departure, she stated: ==Recording== On 27 November 2013, Lewis stated that, during the production of Christmas, With Love in the Summer of 2013, she met with a couple of producers to conceptualize a theme for the album. She confirmed that official recording sessions for the album would begin in January 2014. She also stated that she recently "reached out" to a couple of different songwriters and producers and expressed her desire to work with Bruno Mars and his frequent collaborators, The Smeezingtons. On 19 December 2013, Lewis confirmed that she had recorded a couple of songs with Poet, who has produced material for the Black Eyed Peas, as well as some other unnamed producers. She stated her intentions of going back into the studio with Poet. On 30 August 2014, Lewis revealed that she had spent the week in the studio working with Jesse Shatkin, who co-wrote "Chandelier" for Australian singer-songwriter Sia. On 10 September, Diane Warren confirmed that she and Lewis would be working together. ==Release and promotion== Promotion for I Am began on 19 December 2014 when Lewis posted a short clip of her performing "Fire Under My Feet" and playing the piano, while a member of her band played the drums. On 12 February 2015; Lewis uploaded a video on YouTube that showed her recording the song in the studio. Four days later, another video was uploaded, showing Lewis recording several other songs from the album. On 14 April 2015, Def Jam hosted an album showcase listening party for I Am during which Lewis performed five songs from the album for the first time including "Fire Under My Feet", the title track "I Am", "I Got You", "Ladders", and "Thank You". Two days later, the artwork for the standard edition of the album was revealed. On 21 April 2015 a new video was uploaded via Lewis' official YouTube account; it documents the recording process of "Fire Under My Feet". It also showed the photoshoot that took place for both the single and the album, while a snippet of "Fire Under My Feet" was also played during the video. On 13 June 2015 Lewis performed "I Got You" and "Another Love Song" at the London G-A-Y nightclub. The same day, she premiered "Essence of Me" at BBC Radio 2. The track list for the standard and deluxe edition were first revealed by Amazon.co.uk on 24 June 2015, while artwork for the deluxe edition was unveiled the following day. On 26 June 2015 Universal Music placed pre-orders for I Am on their official website. On 27 June 2015, the album was made available for pre-order on iTunes. On 13 August 2015; "Another Love Song" was made available for purchase as a promotional single at several digital retailers, such as iTunes and 7digital. "Power" was released as a promotional single in Germany on 28 August 2015. It was later made available in all other countries on 4 September 2015. The studio versions of "I Got You" and "Ladders" were premièred in full at BBC Radio 2 on 1 to 3 September 2015, respectively. ===I Am Tour=== On 11 September 2015, Leona announced her third headlining concert tour, the I Am Tour, to support the album, with an initial run of fourteen dates in Great Britain. ===Singles=== The album's lead single, "Fire Under My Feet", was released on 7 June 2015. Written by Lewis and Toby Gad, the track peaked at number 51 on the UK Singles Chart following its release. In addition, it peaked at number 4 on the Billboard 100 Hot Dance charts. "I Am" was released to the iTunes Store in the UK on 17 July 2015 as the second single in the UK. "Thunder" was released as the third official single from I Am on 24 July 2015 ; it also served as the lead release from the album in US markets. It impacted US adult contemporary radio on 27 July 2015. "Thunder" was released as the third single in the UK ; it officially impacted UK radio on 24 October 2015. ==Critical reception== {{Music ratings | MC = | rev1 = AllMusic | rev1Score = | rev2 = Digital Spy | rev2Score = | rev3 = Exclaim! | rev3Score = 5/10 | rev4 = Idolator | rev4Score = | rev5 = Knoxville News Sentinel | rev5Score = | rev6 = London Evening Standard | rev6Score = }} Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars, writing "Lewis seizes this fourth album to redefine her sound [throwing] herself into a buoyant bounce somewhat inspired by reigning British diva, Adele....The songs [on the album] are passionate and sharply crafted [...] resulting in her strongest compositions......and her best album yet". Digital Spy author Lewis Corner found that "for all intents and purposes, I Am is Leona's break-up album. Having worked closely with Toby Gad, she has created a concentrated record with a solid voice throughout that positions her as songwriter with something to say. The mixture of both Leona's frustration and determination leave her more vulnerable than we've heard her before, but ultimately she comes through stronger than ever. Leona's got a different kind of Ex-Factor this time out, and it's working wonders." Chuck Campbell from Knoxville News Sentinel noted that "Lewis sounds great on her new I Am, but the release is still something of a disappointment. Trouble is, it feels a bit obvious, and therefore a little hollow." He added that "Lewis sounds gutsy, as she always does, the production is crisp and the hooks are sharp – so there's no need for excessive complaining. It's just this phoenix-rising tale has been done to death, and her return is only a qualified triumph." Idolator's Kathy Iandoli wrote that while "the 10-track offering is full of beautiful music, it would be remiss to suggest I Am is full of hits. And that's where Leona's voice becomes an impediment." She felt that "I Am may be slightly flawed by design, but there are still many 'yaaasssss' moments, enough to make you hope her next go 'round doesn't take as long." Less enthusiastic, London Evening Standard writer John Aizlewood felt that "I Am will doubtless be billed as a new start but it feels like an ending. [It] is defiantly more of the same and [Lewis is] as cautious as a learner driver on test day. Tinny, timid production makes I Am sound like it was recorded at home but Lewis's vocals are still anodyne cruise-ship fare and she still mistakes caterwauling for emotion." ==Commercial performance== Upon its chart debut, I Am debuted at number 12 on the UK Albums Chart and number 8 on the UK Album Download Chart. I Am debuted at number 38 on the US Billboard 200 Album Chart, Lewis' third album to peak in the US top 40. I Am also peaked at number 11 in Scotland, also charting within the top 40 in Ireland, Germany, Austria, Spain and Switzerland. ==Track listing== Album track listing and credits sourced from album booklet and liner.

41561418	I Can't Stay Mad at You	"I Can't Stay Mad at You" is a song written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King. It was originally recorded by American country artist Skeeter Davis, becoming her second top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1963. "I Can't Stay Mad at You" followed on the popular success of Davis' earlier 1963 crossover hit "The End of the World". The song was one of the first Goffin-King compositions to be recorded by a country music performer. == Background and reception == "I Can't Stay Mad at You" was written by songwriting duo Gerry Goffin and Carole King. They had previously enjoyed pop successes as songwriters, including "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" and "Take Good Care of My Baby". King would eventually embark on a successful recording career in the early 1970s. The song was recorded in April 1963 in Nashville, Tennessee at the RCA Victor Studio, alongside producer Chet Atkins. Six other songs were recorded during the session, including a cover of "I Will Follow Him". According to Allmusic critic Richie Unterberger, "I Can't Stay Mad at You" was recorded in the popular "girl group" musical style. It included heavy choruses backed by a "wall-of-sound" that the Goffin-King pair was used to writing songs for. Unterberger also explains that the song displays similarities to Neil Sedaka's pop hit "Breaking Up Is Hard to Do", stating I Can't Stay Mad at You' begins with a whole verse worth of ultra-catchy doo wop syllables ('Shooby Dooby Doo Bob') that, frankly, is highly reminiscent of the similar patterns used in Neil Sedaka's No. 1 1962 hit 'Breaking Up Is Hard to Do' (written by Sedaka and Howard Greenfield). In fact, the whole song is fairly reminiscent of that previous Sedaka hit, though 'I Can't Stay Mad at You' is, to its credit, a little brighter and more exuberant." The song features a string section featuring violins being played in a high register. == Release == In August 1963, "I Can't Stay Mad at You" was officially released as a single by RCA Victor, with the b-side being "It Was Only a Heart". As a country music artist, the song became Davis' twelfth top-twenty hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles, peaking at number fourteen. The record was an even bigger hit on the pop charts, becoming Davis' second top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching a peak of number seven in 1963. The second peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks The song would become Davis' last single to enter the Billboard Pop top-forty, as her follow-up singles would reach progressively-lower positions on the chart in the later months and years. "I Can't Stay Mad at You" was later issued onto Davis' studio album Let Me Get Close to You in 1964. The B side "It Was Only a Heart" also received pop airplay and peaked at No. 92 on the Billboard Hot 100. == Chart performance == Chart (1963) Peak position US Billboard Hot Country Singles 14 US Billboard Hot 100 Singles 7 US Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Singles 2 == Personnel == * Floyd Cramer – piano * Skeeter Davis – lead vocals * Pete Drake – steel guitar * Buddy Harman – drums * Mary Hicks – organ * Jerry Kennedy – guitar * Anita Kerr Singers – background vocals * Velma Smith – rhythm guitar * Henry Strzelecki – bass (Uncredited) String section featuring violins in the high register. == References == == External links == * Lyrics by Allmusic Category:1963 singles Category:Skeeter Davis songs Category:Songs with lyrics by Gerry Goffin Category:Songs written by Carole King Category:Song recordings produced by Chet Atkins Category:1963 songs Category:RCA Victor singles
41567828	I Can't Believe That It's All Over	"I Can't Believe That It's All Over" is a song written by Ben Peters and recorded and released as a single by American country artist, Skeeter Davis. The song was recorded at the RCA Victor Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, United States on March 9, 1973. The session was produced by Ronny Light. The song was released as a single in May 1973, reaching the number twelve Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart. It was Davis' first major hit in three years on the country chart. It would also be her final major hit. Additionally, the single reached number one on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles Chart, her final entry on the pop chart, which had been preceded by a seven-year hiatus. Additionally, the single peaked at number eleven on the Canadian RPM Country Songs chart. It was issued onto Davis' studio album of the same name. == Chart performance == Chart (1973) Peak position U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles 12 U.S. Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles 1 CAN RPM Country Songs 11 == References == Category:1973 songs Category:Skeeter Davis songs Category:Songs written by Ben Peters Category:1973 singles Category:RCA Victor singles

41606122	I Can Dream About You (album)	I Can Dream About You is the fifth studio album from American musician/singer/songwriter Dan Hartman, released on May 3, 1984, by MCA. The album was produced by Hartman and Jimmy Iovine. I Can Dream About You was Hartman's debut album for MCA Records and marked the first album to feature Hartman's longtime songwriting partner Charlie Midnight, with whom he would continue to write with throughout the rest of the decade. Hartman and Midnight wrote eight out of the ten tracks together, with the title track being written solely by Hartman, and the album's closing track, "Electricity", being written by Hartman and Nona Hendryx. Hendryx's own version of the song was included on her own 1984 album The Art of Defense. Owing to MCA not releasing the follow- up album White Boy, I Can Dream About You was Hartman's final album in his lifetime to feature vocals and lyrics, as his following album, New Green Clear Blue, would consist entirely of instrumental tracks. ==Background== Following the success of Hartman's two disco-oriented albums Instant Replay and Relight My Fire, from 1978 and 1979 respectively, Hartman decided to move into a more melodic pop-rock sound with his 1981 album It Hurts to Be in Love. However, the album was not a commercial success, and its three singles only became minor chart hits. In 1983, Iovine contacted Hartman with the request of writing a song for a film he was working on. Hartman was told the song would be sung by four black guys in a concert situation within the film, and he ended up thinking of a demo he had made of "I Can Dream About You". Hartman then went through some legal maneuvering to get the benefit of his breakthrough. The use of the song in the film being performed by actors did not feature Hartman on vocals but studio singer Winston Ford. After some contract negotiating, Hartman insisted he sing the song on the soundtrack, and that his version be released if a single were to be issued from the soundtrack album. Additionally, any music video had to feature his own voice using the song. These clauses helped Hartman become an "overnight sensation". Both Hartman and Iovine worked on the solo album following the song's use in the film. It was recorded at Hartman's own home studio "Multi-Level" and was mixed at Image Recording in Los Angeles. Speaking to the Orange Coast in 1985, Hartman stated: "It's been 10 years since my last tour, and I'm really enjoying being back out there. Musically I've stayed in touch with what's going on, what people relate to, so it's no surprise appearing in front of an audience in 1985. What is a surprise is that they relate to me. They're giving back so much, which means they're responding to my music. And that makes me feel great." I Can Dream About You peaked at No. 55 on the Billboard 200. It also reached No. 91 in Canada. The album spawned four singles in total. The title track became Hartman's biggest hit, also appearing on the soundtrack to the 1984 film Streets of Fire. The song peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. "We Are the Young" followed as the second single and reached No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100, while also topping the Billboard Dance Music/Club Play Singles Chart. "Name of the Game" was issued as a single, but was not a commercial success. "Second Nature" became the fourth and final single, where it peaked at No. 39 on the Billboard Hot 100, and would prove to be Hartman's last appearance on the chart. I Can Dream About You was Hartman's final mainstream studio album, although he did record a follow-up in 1986 titled White Boy. However, MCA felt the songs did not suit Hartman's image and so the album was shelved, although it has been in circulation unofficially in recent years online. Hartman's final studio album, New Green Clear Blue, was released in 1989, and was an instrumental new age-styled release. Recalling his memories of the album for Hartman's unofficial fan site, Midnight commented: In 1991, Marc Anthony covered the song "Name of the Game" on his collaboration album with Little Louie Vega entitled When the Night Is Over. ===Cover=== The album cover features photography by Jim Shea. Hartman is seen walking in the forefront with Midnight (who is sitting on the steps) and the band members assembled in the background. ==Promotion== Music videos were filmed to promote "I Can Dream About You," "We Are the Young" and "Second Nature". Hartman also performed the songs on varying TV shows in America and Europe. A tour was also organized to promote the album, with Hartman touring alongside Toto. It was his first tour in a decade and also his last. ==Critical reception== Upon release, Billboard picked I Can Dream About You as a recommended album and said: "Dan Hartman's AOR fans should start with side one of "I Can Dream About You", while his dance cult should flip to side two immediately. There are three great uptempo numbers: the uplifting electronic production number "Name of the Game," a bouncy neo-Motown "Second Nature" (of a pair with "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"), and the electro-funk "Electricity," joined by Nona Hendryx." Later in the year, Billboard added that the album had "the same broad-based pop/rock appeal" as the title track. Alex Henderson of AllMusic retrospectively described the album as one of Hartman's "most essential solo albums". He added: "This is primarily a pop/rock album, but it's a pop/rock album with a fair amount of urban contemporary/dance-pop appeal. Though Hartman was a member of a major '70s rock act, the Edgar Winter Group, he also had strong R&B; and disco credentials. Hartman, Midnight, and Iovine all do their part to make I Can Dream About You the focused, consistently rewarding album that it is." ==Track listing== == Personnel == * Dan Hartman – lead vocals, backing vocals, all instruments (except as noted below) * Bill Payne – acoustic piano (2) * Richie Zito – additional guitar (2) * Michael Thompson – additional guitar (5) * Eddie Watkins – bass (2) * Art Wood – additional drums (2), additional snare drums (5) * Bobbye Hall – percussion (2) * Nona Hendryx – Oberheim DMX drum programming (10) * Arno Hecht – tenor saxophone solo (4), tenor saxophone (8) * Crispin Cioe – baritone saxophone (8) * Ernie Watts – tenor saxophone solo (8) * "Hollywood" Paul Litteral – trumpet (8) * Joe Pizzulo – backing vocals (2) * Winston Ford – backing vocals (2) * Ellen Foley – backing group vocals (4, 9) * Frank Simms – backing group vocals (4, 6, 8, 9) * George Simms – backing group vocals (4, 6, 8) * Charlie Midnight – backing group vocals (8) ==Production== * Producers – Dan Hartman and Jimmy Iovine * Engineer – Dan Hartman * Assistant Engineers – Shelly Yakus (all tracks); Gabe Veltri (Track 2). * Recorded at Multi-Level (Westport, CT). * Mixing – Juergen Koppers (Tracks 1, 4 & 5) Humberto Gatica (Track 2); Shelly Yakus (Tracks 3, 8 & 9); Dan Hartman (Tracks 6, 7 & 10). * Mix Assistants – Steve Krause (all tracks); Shelly Yakus (Track 5). * Mixed at Image Recording Studios (Los Angeles, CA). * Mastered by Stephen Marcussen at Precision Lacquer (Los Angeles, CA). * Art Direction – Vartan Kirjian * Photography – Jim Shea * Management – Robert A.

(l-r) Gerry Manzoli, Paolo de Ceglie, Antonio "Tonino" Cripezzi, Livio Macchia I Camaleonti ("The Chameleons") are an Italian pop group from Milan, mostly active between the late 1960s and the early 1970s. == Background == I Camaleonti were formed in 1963 in Milan. The original line-up included Livio Macchia (guitar), Antonino Cripezzi (keyboards), Paolo de Ceglie (drums) and Gerardo Manzoli (bass). In 1965 the band's line-up was augmented with the arrival of Riki Maiocchi on vocals and guitar. The band's first hit was a cover of the Small Faces' "Sha-La-La-La- Lee", and coincided with the popularity of the beat genre. In 1966, vocalist and guitarist Riki Maiocchi left the group to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Mario Lavezzi. With Lavezzi on board, the group gradually began to switch to a more melodic pop sound, soon achieving success with a modern rendition of a popular 1935 tune penned by Cesare Andrea Bixio and Michele Galdieri, "Portami tante rose". Between 1968 and 1973 I Camaleonti had four singles topping the Italian charts, including "Applausi", "Io per lei" and "L'ora dell'amore". Between 1970 and 1993 they entered the Sanremo Music Festival five times, (the last time along with Dik Dik and Equipe 84's lead singer Maurizio Vandelli), finishing third in 1979 with "Quell'attimo in più". Despite numerous line-up changes, the band is still active to these days. == Members == === Current members === * Livio Macchia: vocals, guitar (1963–present) * Valerio Veronese: guitar, vocals (1985–present) * Massimo Brunetti: keyboards, flute (1990–present) * Massimo di Rocco: drums (2004–present) * Matteo Arosio: Tibetan bell (2006–present) === Past members === * Paolo de Ceglie: drums (1963–2004, d. in 2004) * Gerardo "Gerry" Manzoli: bass (1963–1982) * Riki Maiocchi: vocals, guitar (1965–1966) * Mario Lavezzi: vocals, guitar (1966–1968) * Gabriele Lorenzi: keyboards (1967–1968) * Dave Sumner: guitar (1973–1980) * Vincenzo Mancuso: guitar, flute (1981–1984) * Antonio "Tonino" Cripezzi: vocals, keyboards (1963–2022, d. in 2022) ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * 1966 – The Best Records in The World * 1967 – Portami tante rose * 1968 – Io per lei * 1969 – Vita d'uomo (EP) * 1973 – I magnifici Camaleonti * 1974 – Amicizia e amore * 1975 – Piccola Venere ed altri successi * 1976 – Che aereo stupendo… la speranza * 1977 – In vendita * 1979 – ...e camminiamo * 1993 – Come passa il tempo e i più grandi successi * 1996 – Libero * 1997 – Applausi ed altri successi * 2001 – 2001 ed oltre * 2004 – 40 anni di musica e applausi * 2006 – Storia * 2010 – Camaleonti Live ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:Musical groups established in 1962 Category:Italian pop music groups Category:1962 establishments in Italy Category:Musical groups from Milan

4199684	I Believe in Father Christmas	"I Believe in Father Christmas" is a song by English musician Greg Lake with lyrics by Peter Sinfield. Although it is often categorised as a Christmas song, this was not Lake's intention. He said that he wrote the song in protest at the commercialisation of Christmas. Sinfield, however, said that the words are about a loss of innocence and childhood belief. Released in 1975, the song reached number two on the UK Singles Chart, number 17 on the Irish Singles Chart and number 98 in Australia. ==Background== Lake wrote the song at his west London home, after tuning the bottom string of his guitar from E down to D. While the song is against the commercialisation of Christmas, it has often been misinterpreted as an anti-religious song and, because of this, Lake was surprised at its success. He explained in a Mojo magazine interview: > "I find it appalling when people say it's politically incorrect to talk > about Christmas, you've got to talk about 'The Holiday Season'. Christmas > was a time of family warmth and love. There was a feeling of forgiveness, > acceptance. And I do believe in Father Christmas." The instrumental riff between verses comes from the "Troika" portion of Sergei Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kijé Suite, written for the 1934 Soviet film Lieutenant Kijé; this was added at the suggestion of Keith Emerson (an adaptation of the same song was used on Emerson's later Christmas album). Peter Sinfield described the song as "a picture-postcard Christmas, with morbid edges." ==Release== The song was recorded by Lake in 1974 and released separately from ELP in 1975, reaching number two in the UK Singles Chart. It was kept from number one by Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody". Lake commented: "I got beaten by one of the greatest records ever made. I would've been pissed off if I'd been beaten by Cliff (Richard)." However, orchestrator Godfrey Salmon said: "I was surprised the single wasn't more successful. I thought 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was rubbish, and still do. When it got to No 1 before we'd even brought ours out, I thought it would be long gone by Christmas. How wrong can you get?" The record continued to sell and in 1984 and 1986 reached 84 and 98, respectively, on the UK Singles Chart. The song also reached #98 in Australia in late 1975. ==Video== The video for the record was shot on the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, and in the Dead Sea Scrolls caves in the West Bank, and includes footage from the Vietnam War and Six-Day War. ==Legacy== A second recording by the full ELP trio, but with a sparser arrangement, was included on the 1977 album Works Volume 2. It was recorded a third time in 1993, for the ELP box set The Return of the Manticore, and Lake revisited it yet again for the 2002 Sanctuary Records compilation A Classic Rock Christmas. The song has also appeared on several other ELP and Christmas compilation albums including a 1995 EP titled I Believe in Father Christmas, which includes Lake's original single as well as the Works Volume II version. The song has been covered by other artists, including Robbie Williams on "The Christmas Present" in 2019, Toyah Willcox on "Pop Goes Christmas" in 1982, Elaine Paige (on her 1986 album Christmas), Canadian band Honeymoon Suite (on the 1989 WEA compilation album Revellion), Vertical Horizon (on the 2002 compilation Holiday: Sounds of the Season 2002), Sarah Brightman (on her 2008 album A Winter Symphony), U2 (on the 2009 Starbucks charity compilation All You Need Is Love), Joe McElderry on his 2011 album Classic Christmas, Susan Boyle (on her 2013 album Home for Christmas), Hannah Peel as the B-side of her 2014 single Find Peace and In Isolation as a single in 2022. In 2005 Lake wrote a letter to The Guardian about the song, in answer to a reader question regarding whether it was possible to survive on Christmas royalties alone: > In 1975, I wrote and recorded a song called "I Believe in Father Christmas", > which some Guardian readers may remember and may even own. It was a big hit > and it still gets played on the radio every year around December, and it > appears on more or less every Christmas compilation going. So I can tell you > from experience that it's lovely to get the old royalty cheque around > September every year, but on its own, the Christmas song money isn’t quite > enough to buy my own island in the Caribbean. I'm on tour at the moment and > the Christmas song is as well received now as it was 30 years ago – maybe > even more so.

4221000	I Am Ghost	I Am Ghost was an American post-hardcore band from Long Beach, California, United States, conceived of and founded by Steven Juliano in 2004. They were signed to Epitaph Records from 2005 to 2010, before splitting up in July 2010. They briefly reunited on April 28, 2016. == History == Singer Steve Juliano utilized his knowledge of MySpace to attract prospective members to I Am Ghost and formed the original members that included lead guitarist Timoteo Rosales III; rhythm guitarist Gabe Iraheta; violinist Kerith Telestai and her husband, bassist/keyboardist Brian Telestai, and drummer, Victor Camarena. Before the band began touring, Camarena was replaced by Ryan Seaman. After signing to Epitaph Records, the band's self-recorded and self-released EP entitled We Are Always Searching was remastered and re-released by the label. Epitaph issued the band's first album, Lovers' Requiem, on October 10, 2006. Juliano explains, "It’s essentially a rock opera but for hardcore or Goth kids." I Am Ghost toured with Biffy Clyro, TheAUDITION and The Bronx on the Kerrang! Tour 2007, the Epitaph Tour 2007 with Escape the Fate, The Matches, and The Higher, the Take Action Tour in 2006, and played on Warped Tour 2006 and Warped Tour 2007 in support of their first album. Band violinist/vocalist Kerith Telestai released an official statement on June 29, 2007, stating that she would be unable to continue touring and would be leaving I Am Ghost due to health reasons after being hospitalized in both Spokane, WA and Denver, CO on their tour with The Chariot. A few days after Kerith's departure, her husband, Brian Telestai, announced that he too would be leaving the band after the 2007 Warped Tour and their tour with Aiden. According to Juliano, there was a conflict among the remaining members of I Am Ghost and the Telestai's, concerning the direction of I Am Ghost. During the 2007 Warped Tour, bassist/vocalist Ron Ficarro was invited to join the band and replace Brian Telestai. The band's second album, Those We Leave Behind, was released on October 7, 2008. Their second album was met with mixed reviews. Some people felt their new distilled sound was meaner, more aggressive, and only a slight departure from their previous sound, while a lot of their fan base still expected to hear the classic elements of violin and choral voices that had become part of their signature sound. "[Their new sound] has become a big debate between I Am Ghost fans" "[Kerith] helped provide life to the band, and she’s sorely missed. The guitar work of Gabe Iraheta and the drumming of Ryan Seaman are also missed; it’s evident that their musicianship was much better than those who have replaced them". Some have speculated that Juliano wrote the song "Smile of A Jesus Freak" specifically about Kerith Telestai. Fan reviews were mixed: "[Their music is] less epic than before, which I felt had been my favorite appeal to them, but their style and sound of We Are Always Searching is defiantly there. Their key choruses and pounding breakdowns and bridges remain untampered, and the drumming is still right on track." Another review stated, "They might be one of the few remaining screamo bands who’ve yet to change their sound or move onto greener pastures. It’s both commendable and stupid in some aspects." I Am Ghost toured Europe and the United States in support of the album, most recently supporting The Birthday Massacre. On July 17, 2010 Juliano announced the band's break-up. He stated that the band had "...matured and grown up." ==Members== ; Final line-up *Steven Juliano — lead vocals, synthesizers, piano, keyboard, programming (2004-2010), (2016) *Tim Rosales III — lead guitar (2004-2010), (2016) *Chad Kulengosky — rhythm guitar, vocals (2007-2010), (2016) *Justin McCarthy — drums, percussion (2007-2010), (2016) *Ron Ficarro — bass, vocals (2007-2010), (2016) ; Former members *Brian Telestai — bass, guitars, percussion, keyboard, piano, programming, synthesizer, vocals, choral, string & orchestral composition (2004-2007) *Kerith Telestai — vocals, violin, choral, string & orchestral composition (2004-2007) *Victor Angel Camarena — drums (2004-2005) * Ryan Seaman — drums (2005-2007) *Gabe Iraheta — rhythm guitar, programming (2004-2007) ===Timeline=== == Discography and album lineups == ; Studio albums * Lovers' Requiem (2006) Produced by Michael "Elvis" Baskette Steve Juliano - Lead Vocals, Screams, and Gang Vocals Kerith Telestai - Vocals, Violin, Strings, Choral Vocals, Operatic Solo on "The River Styx", Orchestral and Choral Composition Tim Rosales III - Lead Guitar and Gang Vocals Gabe Iraheta - Rhythm Guitar, Programming, and Gang Vocals Brian Telestai - Bass, Vocals, Piano, Keyboard, Choral Vocals, Operatic Solo on "The River Styx", Orchestral and Choral Composition Ryan Seaman - Drums and Gang Vocals * Those We Leave Behind (2008) Produced by Paul Levitt Steve Juliano - Lead Vocals, Screams, and Synthesizers Tim Rosales III - Lead Guitar Chad Kulengosky - Rhythm Guitar and vocals Ron Ficarro - Bass and Vocals Justin McCarthy - Drums and Percussion ; EPs * We Are Always Searching (2005) Produced by I Am Ghost Steve Juliano - Lead Vocals and Screams Kerith Telestai - Vocals and Violin Tim Rosales III - Lead Guitar and Acoustic Guitar Gabe Iraheta - Rhythm Guitar, Gabe Iraheta Brian Telestai - Bass, Piano, Keyboard, and Acoustic Guitar Victor Angel Camarena - Drums ; Live albums * Live in Orange County (2009) == Videography == * "Civil War and Isolation Thirst" (2005) * "Our Friend Lazarus Sleeps" (2006) * "Saddest Story Never Told" (2009) == Post band == As of September 2010, Steve Juliano (vocals) formed a new band with Guitarist Ty Oliver "Requiem for the Dead".

42510343	I Blame Myself	"I Blame Myself" is a song by American singer Sky Ferreira from her debut studio album, Night Time, My Time (2013). It was released in the United Kingdom on June 9, 2014, by Capitol Records as the second single from the record. The song was written and produced by Ariel Rechtshaid and Justin Raisen, with additional songwriting provided by Ferreira, Daniel Nigro, and Jordan Benik. "I Blame Myself" is an electropop and synth-pop song, in which Ferreira acknowledges that she is responsible for her public image. Contemporary music critics commended "I Blame Myself" in their reviews of Night Time, My Time, and placed particular praise on its production. An accompanying music video for the track was filmed in Compton, California, and directed by Grant Singer; it was premiered through Ssense on April 16, 2014. It depicts Ferreira as a gang leader, who is called in to settle a conflict between rivaling groups. She has performed the track on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April 2014. ==Background== thumb|right|250px|"I Blame Myself" was co-written by Ariel Rechtshaid (pictured), who additionally assisted with the songwriting and production of each track on Night Time, My Time. In February 2014, it was reported that "Boys" would be serviced as the second single from Night Time, My Time, following its lead single "You're Not the One" which had been premiered in September 2013. However, Capitol Records instead released the song as a free digital download in the United Kingdom on March 1, preceding the launch of Night Time, My Time in the country. "I Blame Myself" was confirmed as the official second single from the record in April, while Ferreira was filming its accompanying music video. "I Blame Myself" was written and produced by Ariel Rechtshaid and Justin Raisen, with additional songwriting provided by Ferreira, Daniel Nigro, and Jordan Benik. Rechtshaid and Raisen additionally collaborated for the drums. Individually, Rechshaid contributed vocal production, while Raisen was responsible for recording, Pro Tools engineering, additional vocals, synthesizers, and mixing. Mereki Beach provided additional vocals for the track, while Jeremiah Raisen assisted during its production. Ferreira commented that she had co-written the track during summer 2013; she sings "10 years old without a voice / I feel like nothing's really changed / Now I'm just a little older" during the second verse, which she revealed was inspired by a two-year period in which she did not speak because she felt like she had had nothing to offer. ==Composition== Drawing from electropop and synth-pop music, "I Blame Myself" incorporates minimalist production elements with styles commonly seen in new wave music. Distinguished as the "poppiest" track from Night Time, My Time, its lyrics see Ferreira accepting that her behavior contributes to the public image she is given by the media; during the chorus, she states "I just want you to realize I blame myself for my reputation." "I Blame Myself" was assumed to have been inspired by the "anthemic pop fizz" from her breakthrough single "Everything Is Embarrassing" from her second extended play Ghost (2012). Jenn Pelly from Pitchfork implied that "I Blame Myself" referenced the struggles Ferreira faced while creating her long-delayed debut studio album; Pelly suggested that the track was inspired by her frequent conflicts with her record label during production of the project, and added that it "lays out the emotional core" of her process. Jillian Mapes from the same publication assumed that Ferreira crafted the song in response to being labeled a "socialite [and] Forever 21 model" and receiving criticism after her drug arrest in September 2013, which she expected would highlight that her side projects "have nothing to do with the kind of songs Ferreira writes these days". "I Blame Myself", in addition to the tracks "24 Hours" and "Love in Stereo", blend "tenderized vocal hooks [and] chiming synth melodies", which reminded Lauren Martin from Fact of 1980s music. With his similar observation, Dan Keenan from Impact noted that the "chiming synths" that Martin recognized developed into the "undeniably cathartic" refrain. ==Critical reception== "I Blame Myself" received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics. Writing for The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski called the track the "most stunning song" from Night Time, My Time; she commended Ferreira's "confident" vocal delivery and the "strident tone" of the recording, which Zaleski felt was "deeply affecting." Dan Keenan from Impact felt that its lyrics showcased that pop music is not always equivalent with insincerity. Writing for Pitchfork, Carrie Battan felt that "I Blame Myself" sounded like "an uptempo beast" that deserved to be successful. Jordan Sargent from Spin felt that "I Blame Myself" positively exemplified a "darkness" among the stand-out tracks from the record, which he credited to having her adolescence "drained away by airplane flights, photo shoots, and useless recording sessions". The New York Times Jon Caramanica was unsure why Ferreira "[painted] such a dark picture of herself" with the lyrics, and felt that the self-punishment was unnecessary given the strength of "I Blame Myself" and Night Time, My Time overall. John Preston from Polari believed that the track was a worthy substitute for fans that "mourn the overall departure" of the mainstream pop sound of Ferreira's 2010 single "One", and raved that it was an example of "airy and gleaming brilliance". Two critics from Pitchfork reviewed "I Blame Myself" separately from Night Time, My Time. Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth-best song released in 2013. She spoke favorably of its lyrical content, commending the chorus lyrics "How could you know what it feels like to fight the hounds of hell?" and "You think you know me so well" for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for "bullied high school weirdos", and appreciating that the lines "I know it's not your fault / That you don't understand / I blame myself" for acknowledging her own wrongdoings with the intention of starting anew. Jillian Mapes complimented the "bluntness" that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had "anthem potential". She praised the verses for verbalizing self- confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines "I'm just a face without a choice / Trust you'd never like to guess what I think above the shoulders." She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a "declaration of force [and] a song about the power of vulnerability" rather than confusing it for an "admission of weakness". ==Music video== thumb|left|250px|Ferreira (center) performing with background dancers in the music video for "I Blame Myself" An accompanying music video for "I Blame Myself" was filmed in Compton, California, and directed by Grant Singer. During an interview with Idolator, Ferreira commented that "I can't really give too many details about it yet, but I shot it in L.A. with Grant Singer, who does all my other videos. And my family's in it." A 15-second preview of the project was released on April 14, 2014, while the final product was premiered through the online retailer Ssense on April 16, 2014. It was the first of several "shoppable" music videos released through the retailer, in partnership with London magazine System. The clip was inspired by the visuals for 1990s hip hop music and the catalog of Michael Jackson, which Ferreira revealed "inspire me and played a big part of my childhood." The video depicts an ongoing conflict between gangs, which Ferreira attempts to remedy upon her arrival; she is eventually taken in for questioning by law enforcement, although she resists her arrest and later escapes from jail. She commented that its concept was inspired by real events, and elaborated that "people always ask me questions about certain things, and it's kind of like my response." Jeremy Gordon from Pitchfork interpreted Ferreira's commentary to be referencing her arrest in September 2013, in which she was charged with possession of ecstasy. Ferreira was criticized on social media networks for allegedly objectifying African-American people in the music video, with whom she was seen dancing with during several scenes interspersed throughout the clip. On her Facebook account, Ferreira commented that "I never have and never will look at any human being as a prop" and criticized false assumptions of the "rich little white girl exploiting the black people and the ghetto". ==Live performances== Having appeared as the musical guest that evening, Ferreira performed "I Blame Myself" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on April 5, 2014. She was dressed in a sequined blazer, a white shirt, black shorts, a black tie, and sunglasses. Ferreira stood in place while singing the track; the onstage visuals consisted of several blue and red strobe lights. Having taken place before the music video was made publicly available, she revealed that the visuals for the song had been filmed and would be released shortly. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Night Time, My Time. ===Recording=== * Recorded at White Bronco Studios (Highland Park, California) * Mastered at The Lodge (New York City) ===Personnel=== * Sky Ferreira – vocals * Ariel Rechtshaid – production, drums * Justin Raisen – co-production, recording, Pro Tools engineering, additional vocals, bass, keyboards, drums, synthesizer, mixing * Jeremiah Raisen – Pro Tools engineering assistance * Daniel Nigro – Pro Tools engineering assistance, additional vocals, keyboards, editing * Mereki Beach – additional vocals * Chris Kasych – Pro Tools engineering * Mark Santangelo – Pro Tools engineering assistance * Emily Lazar – mastering * Rich Morales – mastering assistance ==References== Category:2013 songs Category:2014 singles Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Music video controversies Category:Sky Ferreira songs Category:Songs written by Ariel Rechtshaid Category:Songs written by Dan Nigro Category:Songs written by Justin Raisen Category:Songs written by Sky Ferreira Category:Song recordings produced by Ariel Rechtshaid

The Corps was initially formed to protect a stretch of Scottish shore between the Firth of Forth and Montrose against a possible German invasion of Britain. accessed November 2011. Later it became the logistical base for Polish Army units fighting as part of the Allies. ==Operations== For most of its existence the core of the Corps was composed of a variety of en cadre units. Once these had been formed into full tactical units, they were dispatched to the fronts separately, as parts of other Allied commands. The units created out of First Corps' nominal infantry brigades were 1st Armoured Division, 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, 1st Reconnaissance Regiment, and a variety of other detachments. The main units of the Corps fought separately, and were grouped together mostly for administrative purposes. After the surrender of Germany in May 1945, the Corps started to act as a single unit. Its two largest components were joined together in northern Germany, near the port of Wilhelmshaven, and the Corps took part in the occupation of Germany. Like most other units of the Polish Armed Forces in the West, it was disbanded in 1947, with personnel transferred to the Polish Resettlement Corps. ==Commanders== It was commanded by generals Marian Kukiel (1940-1942), Józef Zając (1943), Mieczysław Boruta-Spiechowicz (1943-1945), and Stanisław Maczek (1945-1947). ==Subordinate units== Initially the Corps included the HQ, two Rifle Brigades (numbered 1 and 2), five en cadre Rifle Brigades (3, 4, 5, 7 and 8, usually battalion-sized), as well as service units. By late 1940 the Corps had over 14,000 men at arms. The 2nd Rifle Brigade was reformed into the 10th Armored Brigade on 3 October 1940. In 1942, this formation was expanded to the 1st Armoured Division.

4336504	I Blame the Government	I Blame the Government is the final studio album by Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine. It was released on Cooking Vinyl Records in 1998. The album reached #92 on the UK charts. It was originally conceived as a double album, but Carter guitarist Les "Fruitbat" Carter felt double albums were a chore in general to listen through from start to finish, so the plan was scrapped. The album was recorded with a seven-member line-up rather than just a two-member line-up which they had used on their early recordings. Many of the songs released on the album were demo versions, recorded in Fruitbat’s home studio and not final studio recordings, as the band had split up before they had completed work on the album. Carter decided not to scrap the material but rather to release it as it stood. It is the only Carter album not to see any singles released from it, although Fruitbat has stated that he felt there were a couple of songs that could have been singles had the band not split before its release. ==Critical reception== Dave Thompson, in Alternative Rock, wrote that "the lyrics once again shine with punchy wit and the frantically guitar- driven music recaptures their old madcap pop flair." ==Track listing== All songs written by Morrison/Carter # "The Wrong Place at the Wrong Time" - 0:55 # "23:59 End of the World" - 3:41 # "Sunshine" - 3:36 # "The Undertaker and the Hippy Protest Singer" - 3:03 # "Sweetheart Sugar Baby" - 4:41 # "Growing Old Disgracefully" - 3:15 # "The Man Who Bought the World" - 4:40 # "Winning the War" - 3:14 # "I Blame the Government" - 3:19 # "Citizen's Band Radio" - 4:08 # "Psycho Bill" - 2:50 # "Closedown" - 3:27 # "Girls Can Keep a Secret" - 4:35 ==Credits== The album was produced by Carter USM and Simon Painter.

On August 14, Charlie Carver joined the film to play Tyler, who gets involved in a relationship with Michael and Bennett and is heartbroken when Michael rejects homosexuality. On August 15, Avan Jogia joined the film as Nico, a young man whom Michael meets and falls for along his journey. On August 18, Lesley Ann Warren joined the film's cast to play Quinto's character's mother. On August 25, Daryl Hannah joined the film to play Deborah, who runs a Colorado Buddhist retreat where Michael goes to find solace. === Filming === Principal photography began on August 11, 2014, in New York City as actor Franco shared images from the set. On August 20, Franco was spotted during filming on Ocean Avenue in East Rockaway. The production wrapped on August 31, 2014 in Baldwin, New York. Also present in film is Musician/Artist Soda, seen as a dancer in a few scenes. He also supplied artwork for the set. This is notable to mention as he is an alumnus of East Rockaway High School under his birth name. ==Release== The film was released at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, and also screened in the Panorama section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival. It received its California premiere during the 17th FilmOut San Diego LGBT Film Festival. The film was the opening night film of the Frameline Film Festival on June 18, 2015 at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco. Brainstorm Media acquired distribution rights to the film, and set the film for a limited release and through video on demand on January 27, 2017. ==Reception== The film drew mostly mixed reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on 35 reviews, and an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "I Am Michael takes a determinedly balanced approach to its complex subject, and although the results don't always add up, they're anchored by strong work from James Franco." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating "mixed or average". Peter Debruge of Variety wrote, "An unusually nuanced James Franco carries this complex portrait of a man who came out and fought to encourage other LGBT youth before converting to conservative Christianity," but concluded that the film was too dry and kept the title character too distant and veiled in its attempt to be impartial. Boyd van Hoeij wrote in The Hollywood Reporter, "Thankfully, the screenplay doesn't portray the story in simple terms of good or evil, but that doesn't mean that there's quite enough nuance or insight to constantly elevate the material above the level of a well-made-but-TV-ready biopic." Indiewire's Eric Kohn gave the film a B+ grade. ==See also== * List of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender-related films of 2015 == References == == External links == * * Category:2015 films Category:2015 biographical drama films Category:2015 directorial debut films Category:2015 LGBT-related films Category:2000s in LGBT history Category:American biographical drama films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:Ex-gay movement Category:Films about LGBT and Christianity Category:Films based on newspaper and magazine articles Category:Films set in the 2000s Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Gay-related films Category:LGBT-related drama films Category:LGBT-related films based on actual events Category:2010s English- language films Category:2010s American films Category:LGBT-related biographical films
43685030	I Almost Prayed	"I Almost Prayed" is the thirteenth episode and season finale of the second season of the American science fiction series Defiance, and the series' twenty-fifth episode overall. It was aired on August 28, 2014. The episode was written by Kevin Murphy and directed by Michael Nankin. The episode aired back-to-back with the previous episode, "All Things Must Pass". The episode features the song "Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down" by Robert Plant. ==Plot== Nolan (Grant Bowler) forces Cai (Robin Dunne) to go with him so they can stop Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) who continues with Irzu's plan to destroy the planet. Cai explains to Nolan that since Irisa kissed him, he has visions of a past life or from their ancestors and how they stopped the Kaziri. Nolan figures out that to be able to stop Irisa, they have to separate the two keys which are both inside Irisa. Datak (Tony Curran) returns home and finds Pilar (Linda Hamilton) talking with Stahma (Jaime Murray). Pilar wants Christie (Nicole Muñoz) and Alak (Jesse Rath) to go and live with her for a while but Stahma disagrees with her, making the two women argue. Datak asks Pilar to leave and Pilar decides to convince Christie and Alak to go with her since the Tarr family will not allow them to do so. When they are ready to leave, Alak notices something is wrong and does not want to leave, leading Pilar and Quentin (Justin Rain) to kidnap them and force them to go with them. The Tarrs' handmaiden informs Datak and Stahma about the kidnapping and the two of them free Rafe (Graham Greene) from the E-rep camp so they can follow and find Pilar. Berlin (Anna Hopkins) had previously tried to stop the execution of Rafe and found herself nearly being executed herself but she is saved when the Tarrs come to take Rafe. Mercado (William Atherton) returns to Defiance as soon as they hear the news about New York being destroyed and they try to find a way to stop Irisa. Mercado asks Amanda's help and Nolan arrives at Defiance with Cai explaining how they can stop Irisa. Amanda and Pottinger do not believe his story but Mercado does and wants to follow Nolan's plan. That is until Doc Yewll (Trenna Keating) arrives and tells them that she knows how to stop Irisa; by killing her. Nolan reacts to that and Amanda asks to lock him up because he will never cooperate if Irisa has to be killed. E-rep soldier lead Nolan and Cai to prison but before they lock them up, Nolan manages to fight them back and they escape. Yewll explains to Amanda and Pottinger what they have to do to kill Irisa, but Amanda first wants to know why she made a fake Kenya. Yewll lies to her, claiming that she was working with the Votanis Collective as a spy for Pottinger, and that the VC forced her to do it; Yewll claims she never told Pottinger about it because he would stop her. Yewll's lie allows Pottinger, the true culprit, to avoid arousing Amanda's suspicion. After the explanations, the three of them leave to find Irisa. The three find Irisa, but at the moment Amanda is ready to shoot her, Nolan and Cai arrive, and Nolan shoots Amanda's gun, stopping her. Nolan cuffs Amanda and knocks out Pottinger and Yewll. Irisa hears the noise and tries to run away from Cai, but Nolan captures her and Cai manages to transfer one of the two keys into himself making the keys stop controlling Irisa. Irisa wakes up, and when she realizes that she killed Tommy, she asks Nolan to kill her, but Nolan convinces her that she has to fight and save the planet from Irzu. Nolan, Cai, and Irisa get into the ship to finish their mission and stop Irzu, who continues to try in vain to convince Irisa to change her mind until the last possible moment. Cai and Irisa deactivate the ship and save the planet. Cai manages to get out of the ship before it collapses; Irisa and Nolan become trapped, and they enter one of the capsules to protect themselves. At the same time, Amanda and Pottinger, knowing that now they are safe, get together; Yewll gets back to her office; and Datak, Stahma, and Rafe follow Pilar to take back Christie and Alak. ==Reception== ===Ratings=== In its original American broadcast, "I Almost Prayed" was watched by 1.48 million; up by 0.13 from the previous episode. ===Reviews=== "I Almost Prayed" received mixed reviews. Rowan Kaiser from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating and commenting on both episodes (I Almost Prayed and All Things Must Pass that aired the same night) said that this was what he wanted from the show and that the last two episodes were better than Defiance has ever been. "The potentially complex characterization of the entire season was turned into actual characterization here. [...] Meanwhile, the mythology that’s been hovering over the entire season regained its connection to Irisa’s characterization, and gave its apparent world-shattering effects the visual/musical power to justify the supposed threat." Michael Ahr of Den of Geek rated the episode with 4/5 saying that the finale of the season "has us hoping for Season 3" and he says that he is duly impressed by the whole second season. "While not a flawless ending to season 2, both episodes together had some killer character moments and truly excellent special effects (Bear McCreary’s epic music didn’t hurt either) that left me craving a renewal for Syfy’s flagship series." Jesse Schedeen from IGN gave a mixed review to the episode rating it with 7.3/10 saying "This wasn't a perfect finale episode by any means. The conclusion was rushed, and the material focused on Pilar McCawley would have been better off in a different episode entirely. On the other hand, it offered an emotionally satisfying conclusion to Irisa's struggle, and most of the main characters enjoyed memorable moments." Katelyn Barnes of Geeks Unleashed rated the episode with 6/10 saying that both episodes worked hand in hand in bring Season Two to a satisfying if convenient close but she found the first of the two to be the strongest. "Altogether, I thought these last two episodes were a much stronger finale than last year’s, and with all the surprising twists and dramatic and dark character growth, matched the overall improvement of Defiance these past few months." Andrew Santos from With an Accent gave a good review to the episode saying that it was a solid finale in a season that far surpasses its preceding one. "The conclusion was open ended and left plenty of questions to be answered in the following season. [...] The show can’t end without these being answered. I’m currently crossing my fingers hoping Defiance gets picked up for a third season." Billy Grifter of Den of Geek gave a mixed review to the last two episodes saying that the finale was unsatisfying and the show hasn't found its feet. About I Almost Prayed, Grifter said that the episode "was a struggle from the outset, and became increasingly rocky the further along this road it went". ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Defiance (season 2) episodes
4375198	I Can't Quit You Baby	"I Can't Quit You Baby" is blues song written by Willie Dixon and first recorded by Chicago blues artist Otis Rush in 1956. It is a slow twelve-bar blues ensemble piece, with lyrics about the consequences of an adulterous relationship which is difficult to end. "I Can't Quit You Baby" was Rush's first recording and Cobra Records's debut single. It became a record chart hit as well as a blues standard. Rush updated the song in 1966 with a modified arrangement, which was adapted by Led Zeppelin for their 1969 debut album. ==Original song== According to biographer Mitsutoshi Inaba "the song subject is the consequences of adultery and the feeling that a man cannot give up a relationship": In his autobiography, Willie Dixon explained that "I Can't Quit You Baby" was written about a relationship Rush was preoccupied with at the time; Dixon used this to draw out an impassioned performance by Rush. Despite being solely credited to Dixon, Rush felt that the song's identity is very much his own: Inaba added: "Otis' passionate vocal melody with alternations of natural voice, falsetto, shouts, and growls, is his singing style indeed". The song is notated in the key of A major in 12/8 time with a "slow blues" tempo. Rush's original version consists of four twelve-bar vocal sections with lead guitar fills. It was Rush's first recording and took place in Chicago around July 1956. Accompanying Rush on lead guitar and vocal are Big Walter Horton on harmonica, Red Holloway on tenor sax, Lafayette Leake on piano, Wayne Bennett on second guitar, Dixon on bass, and Al Duncan on drums. "I Can't Quit You Baby" was a vehicle for arranger-producer Dixon to launch Rush and Cobra Records, as it was the first single for both. In this regard, it was a success, reaching number six on Billboard's Rhythm & Blues Records chart in 1956. Otis Rush revisited "I Can't Quit You Baby" several times over the years. His 1966 re-recording for the 1966 blues compilation Chicago/The Blues/Today! Vol. 2 uses an altered arrangement with an unusual turnaround (tonic chord followed by a half-step above the tonic chord). Subsequent cover versions usually use the chord substitutions found in Rush's Vanguard rendition. ==Led Zeppelin versions== English rock band Led Zeppelin recorded "I Can't Quit You Baby" for their 1969 debut album Led Zeppelin. According to music journalist Cub Koda, their rendition is "a note-for-note copy of Otis Rush's" 1966 Vanguard version, although with different instrumentation and dynamics. It also incorporates a break during the guitar solo where Jimmy Page plays a four-bar unaccompanied set-up before relaunching into the solo. Although biographer Keith Shadwick notes Page's fluff on the turnaround coming out of the solo, he concludes the song "ends up as one of the most successful pieces on the first album, with no flat spots and a perfectly symmetrical form, all within the classic blues tradition". Led Zeppelin regularly performed "I Can't Quit You Baby" in concert from 1968 to early 1970. Two live versions from 1969 are included on the 1997 BBC Sessions. A performance of the song on January 9, 1970, at Royal Albert Hall is included on the 2003 Led Zeppelin DVD (an edited version of this performance was released on the 1982 Coda album). In 1970, the song was dropped from Led Zeppelin's typical concert lineup as they incorporated material from Led Zeppelin III into their shows, with "I Can't Quit You Baby" essentially being replaced by "Since I've Been Loving You". It was however revived as part of the "Whole Lotta Love" medley during some Led Zeppelin concerts in 1972 and 1973. The song was rehearsed by the surviving members of Led Zeppelin for the May 14, 1988, Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary Celebration, but was not performed during the event. In a contemporary review for the Coda album, Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone found the Coda version of "I Can't Quit You Baby", "tossed off a sound check [in 1970]", "perfectly captures the bluesmania of the period, complete with a classically overwrought guitar solo." ==Recognition and influence== "I Can't Quit You Baby" is a blues standard that has been recorded by more than 30 artists. Rush's original Cobra single was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1994 that noted "a Willie Dixon production revealing Rush as an extraordinary talent with an impassioned approach." ==See also== *List of Led Zeppelin songs written or inspired by others ==References== ==External links== *"I Can't Quit You Baby" Partial list of versions Category:1956 songs Category:1956 singles Category:Otis Rush songs Category:Led Zeppelin songs Category:Songs written by Willie Dixon Category:Blues songs Category:Song recordings produced by Jimmy Page Category:Cobra Records singles

43796453	I (soundtrack)	I is the soundtrack album to the 2015 Indian romantic thriller film of the same name written and directed by S. Shankar. A. R. Rahman composed the original songs and background score for the film. The album consists of seven tracks, which include a remix and a reprise. Recording of the songs began in 2012 and was completed by 2014. Songs in the film vary in genre like EDM, bhangra, opera, urban. The original version of the soundtrack has youth oriented voices. The original version of the album was released on 6 September 2014. The audio was launched at a grand function at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium, Chennai on 12 September 2014, with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Chief Guest. The dubbed Hindi version of the album was released at a promotional event held in PVR, Mumbai on 31 December 2014. The dubbed Telugu version of the album was released digitally on the same day. The soundtrack as well as the score received a very positive critical reception and it was declared one of the top twenty best selling albums of 2014 by iTunes India. At the 2016 Filmfare Awards, A. R. Rahman won the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director whereas lyricist Madhan Karky won Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist for his lyrics to the song "Pookkalae Sattru Oyivedungal". Shreya Ghoshal was nominated for the same track under Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer. Lyricist Kabilan was nominated for Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist for the track "Ennodu Nee Irundhaal". However, Sid Sriram won the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song. == Development == A. R. Rahman was selected to compose the original songs and background score for the film. In early July 2012, singer Vijay Prakash recorded the track "Pareshanayya" (Telugu version of "Mersalayitten"). In January 2013, the song "Aila Aila" was recorded. Karky called it as the "most challenging song" he had ever worked on. As some part of the film's story is about modeling, his team created a compilation of six-seven commercials that play to this song. According to Karky, "The lyrics of Aila Aila was the most difficult to pen as each line will have two different meanings, one is what you hear and one is what you are going to watch on the screen". The five and a half minute track blends genres like pop, bhangra, opéra comique elements and electronic beats. In an interview with The Hindu, S. Shankar stated that he wanted unusual music for I with extensive experimentation. He called the experimentation most evident in this track especially the operatic part. The song slightly touches underlying feeling of romance. Portions of the track "Ennodu Nee Irundhaal" sung only by Sunitha Sarathy were recorded on 14 February 2013. Rahman was supposed to have sung "Ennodu Nee Irundhaal" but chose Sid Sriram because the latter sang it well and Rahman felt that Sriram didn't earn the deserving recognition through track "Adiye" from Kadal, thus gave a second opportunity. Lyricist Madhan Karky's third song in the film was recorded by mid – September 2013. In May 2014, Rahman through his bulletin board system of Reddit stated that the film songs have more youth-oriented voices. The track "Mersalaayiten" was recorded by Anirudh Ravichander and Neeti Mohan in the span of July – August 2014. On 4 July 2014, the recording of all the songs for both the versions – the original Tamil version and the dubbed Telugu version were completed. Pravin Mani was involved in post-production of the album for two months. He was recruited for the work of recording ancillaries and corrections. Madhan Karky explained the meanings of the Tamil words he had used in the song "Ladio" on his Twitter page. == Release == On 24 March 2014, Sony Music India acquired the audio rights of the film. The official soundtrack album cover of the film was released on 6 September 2014. The audio launch was planned for a release in Canada, but the film's producer, V. Ravichandran, asserted that the music of the Tamil version would be released at a grand event at the Nehru Indoor Stadium in Chennai on 12 September 2014. On 1 September 2014, Arnold Schwarzenegger confirmed himself as an invitee at the forthcoming event; also Kannada actor and singer Puneeth Rajkumar and Telugu actor Rana Daggubati was as chief guests. Ravichandran said Rahman would present the songs in a fashion similar to a live music concert. International bubble artist Ana Yang, wife of the 16-time Guinness World Record holder, Fan Yang, performed as part of the event. Weta Workshop artists who have worked on the film would provided the makeup for the background dancers, who delivered the performances wearing the actual costumes from the respective songs. A fashion show by the film's costume designer took place. A rough cut version of the song "Merasalaayiten" leaked onto the internet a day prior to the music launch. Bobby Simha and singer Chinmayi hosted the audio launch. Anirudh Ravichander, Karthik, Keba Jeremiah, Neeti Mohan, Haricharan, Natalie Di Luccio, A. R. Rahman, Amy Jackson and Vikram were part of the stage performances. The team from Weta Workshop was introduced after the song "Ennodu Nee Irundhaal" was performed. In addition to the songs from the soundtrack album, Rahman also performed a few tracks from his previous compositions, which were "Oorvasi Oorvasi", "Chikku Bukku Rayile", "Ottagathai Kattiko", "Muqabala", "Petta Rap", "Maya Machindra", "Shakalaka Baby", "Girlfriend", "Colombus Columbus", "Athiradi Kaalam" and "Irumbile Oru Irudhaiyam". The audio launch event was telecasted on Jaya TV on 3 October 2014, coinciding with Vijayadasami celebrations. == Critical reception == === Songs === The album received very positive reviews upon release. Critic Baradwaj Rangan for The Hindu called the soundtrack "wholly individual" that liberates A. R. Rahman. He felt, "The soundtrack that sets Rahman apart. At his most playful, he’s capable of synthesising sound and tunesmanship to produce music that’s the equivalent of a modern-art mural. You may not want it on your wall, but this isn’t about wanting it on your wall." Sify said, "Despite the fact it is not among Isaipuyal’s greater works, ’I’ still has 2-3 numbers that are bound to get stuck in our playlists. The simpler tunes like "Ennodu Nee Irundhaal" and "Pookale Satru Oyvedungal" are here to stay while the peppy "Mersalaayiten" and the Shankar-esque "Aila Aila" are bound to get enriched by the visuals." and rated the album 3.5 out of 5. Behindwoods chose "Merasalaayiten", "Pookkalae Sattru Oyivedungal" and the track "Ennodu Nee Irudhaal" as well as its reprise as the album's picks and gave a rating of 3.5 out of 5, concluding that "Rahman & Shankar are back to doing what they do best, churn out chart busters !" Vipin of Music Aloud stated, "Three winning songs in a half-and-half soundtrack from A R Rahman. Still would rate in the lower half of the ARR-Shankar repertory". However, he called "Pookkalae Sattru Oyivedungal" as "the best of the soundtrack, a charming melody", and gave the album a rating of 8 out of 10. === Background score === Writing the critical reception for Firstpost, Latha Srinivasan stated, "Shankar has done justice to A.R. Rahman’s tunes and that’s a visual treat in the film." Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote called it a score that 'engage ones senses', further noting, "I could easily be a silent movie—though a noisy one, with a boom-boom score by A.R. Rahman that signals at each turn how the audience should feel, and with flurries of drums, speeds the film along." Gulte called, Rahman's music 'average', comparing it its standards to his previous works done for Shankar's films. Nandini Ramnath at Scroll writes that the film has, "AR Rahman’s least memorable scores with background music set at the level that reads 'This has the potential of damaging eardrums.'" An IANS review mentions, "A.R. Rahman's score to the film doesn't make much of a difference but for remaining mostly soothing and melodic." Subramanian Harikumar of Bollywood Life stated, "The songs, composed by Rahman, are brilliant, especially Tum Todo Na (Ennodu Nee Irunthaal) song will leave you mesmerised. A great background score from AR Rahman." Suhani Singh for India Today' writes, "Music by A.R. Rahman is top class! He has obviously given his best to match up to Shankar's vision." R. Vishal at United Internet wrote, "The songs fail to allure the viewer in the way Shankar’s previous movies have." For Bangalore Mirror, R. S. Prakash stated, "A R Rahman has been the composer of all of Shankar's directorial ventures, but here Rahman seems to have been in a hurry to wrap up as none of the songs are effective." Surabhi Redkar for Koimoi writes, "A R Rahman’s music too does not turn out endearing and overall during the songs." Writing for Mumbai Mirror, Rahul Desai praised the score in film, calling it 'throbbing hours of an operatic musical'. Critic based at Bollywood Hungama felt, "The film suffers in the music department (A. R. Rahman), wherein the songs seem to be thrusted into the film's situation." == Track listing == === Tamil === The official track listing of the original version was released by Sony Music South on 10 September 2014. ===Hindi=== === Telugu === == Release history == Album Country Date Format Label Ref I (Original) Worldwide 12 September 2014 Digital download Sony Music India Worldwide 24 September 2014 India 31 October 2014 CD Sony Music Entertainment United States 5 November 2014 United Kingdom Germany 26 November 2014 France I (Hindi) India 31 December 2014 Digital download T-Series I -Manoharudu (Telugu) Sony Music Entertainment == Album credits == Backing Vocals Nivas, Santhosh Narayanan, Deepak, Arjun Chandrasekar, Pooja A.

A car is shown driving to the river. The cast are the members of Imagine Dragons, and their relatives and friends. Somewhere else at the river, a boy in a shirt (DeHaan) and a boy in overalls (Neustaedter) are fighting at the waterbed. While walking away, Neustaedter eventually pushes DeHaan into the river, and it is implied that DeHaan swims away, while the former stares in shock. DeHaan is pulled towards a dam, in which he is sucked in. He lands in a house, and looks out the window and finds everything underwater. He finds a bed and goes to sleep. The next morning, DeHaan finds himself in a sailboat, and takes control of it. He tries unsuccessfully to avoid a waterfall, but ends up flying over the land in the boat when he goes over the waterfall. While looking over the boat, he decides to flip it over. He falls into a city, and a crowd is shown carrying him. They toss and turn him, until he realizes it was a vision and he was knocked unconscious in the dam. He is pulled back up to the surface by Neustaedter, and survives. The last shot of the video zooms out from the point where DeHaan is picked up, and the video ends. ==Reception== Carolyn Menyes of Music Times called the song "Another [Imagine Dragons] strong armed rolling anthem."

44591373	I Am the Greatest (Cassius Clay album)	I Am the Greatest is a comedy album by boxer Cassius Clay, released in August 1963 – six months before he won the world heavyweight championship, publicly announced his conversion to Islam, and changed his name to Muhammad Ali. It was released by CBS Columbia. The album helped establish Ali's reputation as an eloquently poetic "trash talker". The album has also been identified as an early example of rap music and a precursor to hip hop music. ==Overview== The liner notes were written by the American poet Marianne Moore, a longstanding fan of Clay. Clay collaborated on the writing for the album with the comedy writer Gary Belkin, who was listed as producer on the original release and later as a co-writer in a 1999 re-release.Martin, Douglas, "Gary Belkin, 79, Dies; Wrote Comedy for TV Variety Shows", New York Times, August 4, 2005. Belkin would later claim he had largely ghost-written the works, although Belkin's assertions have been disputed (e.g., by George Plimpton and David Remnick).Paul Beatty, Hokum An Anthology of African American Humor, 2008, p. 463 The album idea had been proposed to Clay by the William Morris Agency, and the recording was conducted at Columbia Records' 30th Street New York Studio before an audience of 200 people. Rather than being listed as "tracks", the first 8 entries on the album were listed with "rounds" numbers, and Billboard duly noted that Clay claimed he would beat Sonny Liston in 8 rounds.Billboard, August, 1963, Cassius Clay Cuts Record in Eight Although Clay's remarks were treated skeptically at the time as mere promotional bragging, when the Liston fight was held the following February, Clay won in a major upset when Liston gave up after only 6 rounds. Clay had proved tougher than expected from the beginning, and he began to dominate the fight in the third round. Despite being nearly blinded in the fourth round – apparently by an ointment used on a cut on Liston's face – Clay recovered, and by the end of the sixth round he was landing blow-after-blow in combinations, almost at will. At the opening of the seventh round, Liston spat out his mouth guard and refused to rise to continue. On the day after the fight, it was disclosed that Clay had joined the Nation of Islam (which was confirmed by Clay himself the following day), and a week later its leader Elijah Muhammad announced that Clay would change his name to Muhammad Ali. Following his upset victory and other major news, there was a surge in demand for the LP of the previous August. To take advantage of the moment, the title track "I Am The Greatest" was also released as a single, with the B-side "Will The Real Sonny Liston Please Fall Down". The phenomenon became a significant event in the musical culture that year.Billboard, March 7, 1964, full story on page 4. "I Am The Greatest" was also released as a single with Clay singing his cover of the Ben E. King song "Stand By Me", which resurfaced on CD in 1991 as part of the compilation Golden Throats 2: More Celebrity Rock Oddities.Gordon Castelnero, TV Land Detroit, 2006, p.158 "the artist on that '45 was a rising athlete who professed to Float like a butterfly..."Fred L. Worth, Rock Facts, 1985 "Muhammad Ali had a minor hit with the Ben E. King classic "Stand By Me" with "I Am The Greatest" as the flip side. After later controversy, Columbia pulled the LP and single from stores.Richard Crouse, Big Bang Baby, Rock Trivia, 2000, p. 55 Ali did not make another record until he teamed up with Frank Sinatra and Howard Cosell to record The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay in 1976. The album was re-released on CD on 6 Jun. 2016. ==Reception and legacy== I Am the Greatest was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Performance at the 6th Annual Grammy Awards in 1964; it lost to Allan Sherman's song "Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp)". I Am the Greatest reached number 61 on the album chart, and sold 500,000 copies in the United States. Certain tracks on the album have been identified as rap music, such as "Will The Real Sonny Liston Please Fall Down" which is identified as the first rap battle track. I Am the Greatest is considered a precursor of hip hop music, with Muhammad Ali's impact on hip hop well documented. ==Track listing== The LP consists of monologues and poems devoted mainly to Clay himself.Thomas Hauser, Muhammad Ali His Life and Times, 2010, p. 56 ;Bonus Tracks ==References== Category:1963 debut albums Category:Muhammad Ali albums Category:Columbia Records albums

45039253	I Am Alive in Everything I Touch	I Am Alive in Everything I Touch is the eighth studio album by Canadian post- hardcore band Silverstein. The album was released on May 19, 2015 through Rise Records (worldwide) and New Damage Records (Canada). ==Music and lyrics== Similar to A Shipwreck in the Sand (2009) and This Is How the Wind Shifts (2013), I Am Alive in Everything I Touch is a conceptual album penned by lyricist and lead vocalist Shane Told. The album is split into 4 chapters: "Borealis" (North), "Austeralis" (South), "Zephyrus" (West) and "Eurus" (East). Each track's setting is a different city that geographically falls into that region, with real life recordings of each city incorporated into the songs. Told had this to say about the album: ==Recording== The album was recorded with producer Jordan Valeriote. ==Release== On January 13, 2015 A music video for "A Midwestern State of Emergency" was released alongside the song's streaming release and coincided with the official announcement of I Am Alive in Everything I Touch. The music video was directed by Max Moore and produced by Nolan Cubero. The video begins with Shane Told (lead vocalist) in a bath of water, seemingly dead. He resuscitates as the music begins and the band can be seen playing throughout – with Told subsequently singing to himself in many places. The music video ends in the same place it begins, only with Told now on the floor spluttering water out. A lyric video for the song "Milestone" was released on March 4, 2015. This video consists of footage from Silverstein's Discovering the Waterfront 10th anniversary tour as well as images of highways and buildings. This is all overlaid by the lyrics of the song. On May 11, the music video for "Face of the Earth" was released. On May 12, the album was available for streaming, and was released on May 19 on Rise. In November and December, the band went on a co-headlining US tour with Senses Fail. They were supported by Hundredth and Capsize. ==Reception== Jonathan Diener of Alternative Press said that the album's concept didn't "overshadow" the compositions. He named "A Midwestern State of Emergency" as the group's "best work", showing off their combination of screaming verses flowing into "huge singalong choruses". He also said that "Late on 6th" broke the flow so that "monotony never sets in". The album was included on The Noise's "The 27 Best Albums Of 2015 So Far" list. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Silverstein * Shane Told – lead vocals * Paul Koehler – drums * Josh Bradford – rhythm guitar * Billy Hamilton – bass * Paul Marc Rousseau – lead guitar ;Production * Jordan Valeriote – producer, mixing, engineer * Chris Cosentino - engineer * Joao Carvalho - mastering * Paul Dickinson - drum tech * Michael Colasardo - album layout * Anna Lee - band photography * Billy Hamilton - additional photography * Martin Wittfooth – album illustrations * Anna Jarvis - cello ==Chart positions== Charts (2015) Peak position Canadian Albums Chart 18 U.S. Billboard 200 33 U.S. Billboard Alternative Albums 6 U.S. Billboard Digital Albums 22 U.S. Billboard Hard Rock Albums 3 U.S. Billboard Independent Albums 3 U.S. Billboard Rock Albums 6 U.S. Billboard Tastemaker Albums 3 ==References== Footnotes Citations ==External links== *I Am Alive in Everything I Touch at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:2015 albums Category:Silverstein (band) albums Category:Rise Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Metalworks Studios
45041581	I Bet (Ciara song)	"I Bet" is a song by American singer Ciara from her sixth studio album, Jackie (2015). Released as the lead single from the album by Epic Records on January 26, 2015, "I Bet" serves as Ciara's first single following the birth of her first child and widely publicized break-up with American rapper Future. The song was written by the singer, Harmony "H-Money" Samuels and Timothy and Theron Thomas of the production duo Rock City. It was produced by Samuels, and Chris "TEK" O'Ryan was responsible for its vocal production. Developed as a "raw" and emotional track originating from a personal place in Ciara's life, "I Bet" was intended to resonate as "much bigger than any one person's experience". A slow-tempo, somber R&B; ballad—with sparse, throwback 1990s-style R&B; production—"I Bet" shifts from the sound of the singer's later discography to recall her earlier works, "And I" (2005) and "Promise" (2006). The track's lyrical content deal with subjects of betrayal, trust issues and infidelity in a romantic relationship. "I Bet" was well received by music critics who deemed it a strong comeback for the singer, and commended her vocal range, as well its rare and honest showcase of her private life. Described as a realest, scathing breakup song, a variety of publications opined that the ballad was written about Ciara's break-up with Future as a diss track, and noted that it was the first time the singer weighed in on their split. Upon its release the song debuted at number 96 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number 43. Three official remixes have been released – one featuring T.I., another featuring Joe Jonas and a dance remix by Dutch DJ R3hab with additional vocals added for R3hab's remix. ==Background== Following the release of her self-titled fifth studio album in July 2013 and her engagement to American rapper Future, Ciara revealed to W in April 2014 that her sixth studio album would be predominantly inspired by her then-fiancé. Named after the rapper, the singer gave birth to her first child, Future Zahir Wilburn on May 19, 2014. After claims of Future's infidelity during their relationship had surfaced, it was reported that the couple's engagement had been called off. Following their very public break-up, Ciara's album release was further postponed to 2015, and during this time the singer "quietly" recorded new music, while concentrating on motherhood. "I Bet" was co-written by Ciara, Harmony "H-Money" Samuels, and Timothy and Theron Thomas of Rock City. Samuels produced the track with Chris "TEK" O'Ryan handling its vocal production. "I Bet" was engineered by O'Ryan with the assistance of Carlos King, Ryan Kaul and Maddox Chim. While Jaycen Joshua and Dave Kutch were responsible for its mixing and mastering respectively. Developed as a "raw" and emotional track which originates from a personal place in Ciara's life, she wrote the song with the intention to resonate with her listeners as "much bigger than any one person's experience". Ciara felt that the experience of recording the track "truly fulfilled her" at the time, and saw "I Bet" as a manifestation of a renewed artist with a renewed attitude. ==Release== On January 13, 2015, music website All Access announced the name of the single in their radio format release schedule. The song's planned release to rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio, resulted in media speculating that "I Bet" would recall the works of Ciara's last two lead singles, "Ride" (2010) and "Body Party" (2013). Mike Wass of Idolator observed: "She could also be going for a multi-format release—with one track sent to urban radio and another being serviced to pop stations. That could be one way of returning the 29-year-old to her early 2000s dominance". Other critics noted the length of Ciara's musical hiatus prior to the release of "I Bet", with The BoomBox commenting, "It seems like ages since Ciara's bedroom banger 'Body Party'". The same day, it was revealed that Samuels had produced "I Bet" which critics felt was "somewhat surprising," considering Ciara's previous studio sessions with producer Dr. Luke which garnered widespread media coverage. "I Bet" then received a surprise premiere online by Billboard later that evening. Following its premiere, publications noted that the release of the song was reminiscent of Ciara's 2012 single "Sorry", which also served as a comeback for the singer in the form of a ballad. The single's cover artwork, a black-and-white close- up of Ciara's face, was first posted on Instagram by the singer also on January 13, 2015. The artwork was shot during a photoshoot for L'Uomo Vogue with whom Ciara partnered with for the release of "I Bet". The track serves as the lead single from Ciara's upcoming sixth studio album, Jackie, and was released by Epic Records as a digital download on January 26, 2015. The song was then solicited to rhythmic and urban contemporary radio in the United States with an impact date of January 27, 2015."I Bet" impacted the following radio formats in the United States on January 27, 2015: *Rhythmic contemporary: *Urban contemporary: "I Bet" was made available on streaming media the same day. Several acoustic snippets of the track alongside visuals from the singer's shoot with L'Uomo Vogue were also released on January 27. ==Composition== "I Bet" is a slow-tempo, somber, R&B; ballad. Comprising snapping snares and canned synths, it is accompanied by throwback 1990s-style R&B; production, and includes the use of string and keyboard instrumentation, and a steady beat. A quiet, contemplative and deeply personal record, "I Bet" moves away from the sound of Ciara's later discography and recalls some of her earlier work, namely "And I" (2005), and "Promise" (2006). Samuels' piano- laden, acoustic-driven, sparse production allowed Ciara to solicit a venting, passionate vocal in the song. The track features prominent background ad-libs by its co-writer, Theron Thomas, which were noted to share similarities with the works of Future. The vocal range displayed by Ciara on "I Bet" spans two octaves, from the low note of (Eb3) up to the belted note of (Eb5). The lyrical content in "I Bet" are based on subjects of betrayal, trust issues and infidelity in a romantic relationship. They are aimed at an ex-lover who took Ciara for granted, and see her relive a relationship gone awry. "I Bet" also details a story about life in the public eye. Described as a realest, scathing breakup song, its content feature the singer making a stand to tell-off an ex- lover for not appreciating her. "I Bet" goes through the motions of feeling bitter, by acting as a callout of her former love interest's new girlfriend, manifested in the line, "Is that your bitch over there givin' me the ugly stare / The one with the silicone ass and the Brazilian hair". Despite her ex- lover's wrongdoings, Ciara admits she still loves him, namely in the lyric, "I'm singing this song 'cause I love you… Right now it's killing me 'cause now I have to find someone else when all I wanted was you". The track's hook serves as a revelation that the singer's former lover will want her back, manifested in the lines, "I bet you start loving me / As soon as I start loving someone else / Somebody better than you / I bet you start needing me / As soon as you see me with someone else / Somebody other than you". Later in the song, it is revealed that in the situation, Ciara is not as boastful as the chorus would suggest; and tells a story of the pain of finding a new lover when her future was planned with her former one. Regarding the subject of the track's lyrics, a number of journalists opined that they were based on Future, and in part insulted him as a diss track. Some critics noted that "I Bet" was the first time the Ciara weighed in on her break-up with Future, and wrote that the track "bit back at Future" and was essentially Ciara's take on their split. Referring to "I Bet" and Future's "Just like Bruddas", Stereogum's Tim Breihan observed: "Future and Ciara were the two halves of one of rap and R&B;'s greatest power couples. But now, their ugly public breakup has reached the point where they're both writing songs about it". Rap-Up mentioned, "a hurt CiCi sings about a lover who did her wrong, much like her ex-fiancé Future". The lyrics in "I Bet" were described by radio station WKYS as telling a very clear story of Ciara's feelings towards Future. While Larry Fitzmaurice of The Fader noted that the track's cutting lyrics also depicted that there was no love lost between Ciara and Future, and opined that the lines—"I mean, I would stay if you could tell the truth / But you can't / No matter how much time I ask"—served as a "seriously withering burn" in the former couple's relationship. Other critics opined that "I Bet" showcased Ciara as self- assured and working through her past relationship. Ciara has not confirmed or denied how "I Bet" was inspired by her relationship with Future, despite the personal weight that the track carries. ==Critical reception== "I Bet" received praise from music critics. Erika Ramirez of Billboard felt that "I Bet" was a strong comeback for the singer. Exclaim! journalist Josiah Hughes praised Ciara's "excellent vocal delivery" and called the track "a likely hit". The song was deemed "bold," "sumptuous" and "Ciara's most memorable song in years" by Melissa Ruggieri of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Ruggieri went on to opine that "I Bet" "will surely inspire plenty of chatter," and quipped, "Ciara is back, and she's not messing around". British magazine Fact wrote, "Ciara's not mincing her words on her new single". Carolyn Menyes of the Music Times described the track's chorus as "universal" and felt the song was "stunning" and "some of her best music in years". Complex Justin Davis commended Samuels' production on the track for providing Ciara with "plenty of instrumentation to show off her impressive vocal range". Maria Sherman of Fuse said, "If you need a new heartbreak anthem, you've found it here". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson described the ballad as "a nice and smooth introduction of what's to come," adding, "['I Bet' is] a soft launch of sorts, suitably hyping us up for what is still to come". Nolan Feeney of Time commented, "Let's hope the Jackie album campaign has more luck than her personal life [because 'I Bet'] deserves better". The track received a mixed review from Idolator's Bianca Gracie who opined that the track failed to provide the "expected punch" reminiscent in the singer's 2013 single "I'm Out". However, she commended the song for showcasing "a more honest side to the often-private singer". Emily Tan of The BoomBox shared Gracie's view, writing, "Since [Ciara's] known to be on the private side, we're pleased to hear her get in touch with her emotions here". Feministing's Clover Hope wrote: "This isn't super hit status, but it's... Ciara. Good job Ciara." Simarly to Stereogum's Breihan, Lindsey Weber of New York Magazine compared "I Bet" with Future's break-up song, "Just like Bruddas". She opined that Future's version of the story was "just awful," and Ciara's "less so, although still pretty biting". Weber went on to conclude her review, writing: "But isn't success the best revenge? Too bad 'I Bet' isn't much of a banger." Breihan, however, deemed the ballad "a triumphant, badass single," where Ciara sounds "less robotic than ever". ==Accolades== Publication Country Accolade Spin The 63 Best Songs of 2015 So Far 13 Spin The 101 Best Songs of 2015 58 == Commercial performance == On January 23, 2015, "I Bet" debuted at number 12 on Billboard Top Twitter Tracks, marking Ciara's first entry on the chart. According to Next Big Sound, its debut was contributed by the 1.8 million views the song's audio received on YouTube in its first week. Following its rhythmic contemporary impact date in the United States on January 27, 2015, "I Bet" became the second most-added single on the format with 25 adds in its first day.

45075975	I Alone (The Vampire Diaries)	"I Alone" is the 9th episode of the sixth season of the American series The Vampire Diaries and the series' 120th episode overall. "I Alone" was originally aired on December 4, 2014, on The CW. The episode was written by Brian Young & Holly Brix and directed by Kellie Cyrus. In the episode, Liv sends Damon and Elena back to 1994 to save Bonnie but Kai's return to Mystic Falls ruins their plans since Liv is forced to bring them back to present before they get Bonnie. Stefan meets the girl who appears as his relative Sarah, but since Stefan knows the real Sarah, he knows that she is lying. He makes her tell him the truth and then compels her to forget everything about Sarah and Mystic Falls. Enzo who suspects that Stefan is hiding something, he kills the girl. In the meantime, Kai firstly attacks Liv but later he meets Tyler telling him that he wants to save Liv's life and he is asking for his help. The episode received mixed reviews from the critics. ==Plot== After Damon (Ian Somerhalder) compels Alaric (Matt Davis) to do whatever he has to do to get the ascendant from Jo (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), Alaric has no choice. After obtaining it, Damon compels him again to forget everything and along with Elena (Nina Dobrev) they meet Liv (Penelope Mitchell) who sends them back to 1994 to find Bonnie (Kat Graham) and bring her home. While searching for Bonnie, Elena wonders why Jo agreed to give Damon the ascendant which is the only thing that is protecting her from Kai (Chris Wood), but Damon manages to avoid the truth. Damon and Elena page Bonnie and are able to speak to her and tell her that they are bringing her home. In their conversation Bonnie tells them that Kai stabbed her to get her blood leaving her in Portland, and that she fear Kai might be free. While waiting for Bonnie to get back in Mystic Falls, Damon tells Elena the truth of how he got the ascendant something that makes her furious accusing him that he would do anything to make her fall in love with him again, no matter who gets hurt. Damon confesses her that Bonnie kept him alive while the two of them were stuck in 1994 and she was the one giving him hope explaining that this is the reason he wants to save Bonnie and not only to make her fall in love with him again. Back in present time, Kai kills a cab driver and once he arrives in Mystic Falls he finds Liv. He steals some of her magic and tries to kill her but Tyler (Michael Trevino) comes in time and saves her. Seeing that Kai is free, Tyler wants to take Liv inside the borders of Mystic Falls that no magic works to protect her from Kai. That forces Liv to bring Damon and Elena back to the present before Bonnie gets to them and she is left behind again. They try to convince her to send them back but Liv leaves with Tyler. A little bit later, Kai finds Elena and Damon at the cemetery and destroys the ascendant while he crosses the border and gets to Mystic Falls, with Elena and Damon not be able to do anything to stop him. Jo finds out that the ascendant is gone and confronts Alaric, being the only other person who knew where she kept it, but Alaric swears he did not take it. Jo tells him that it might be possible that he took it but he does not remember because he was compelled to forget. Alaric tells her that Damon is his friend and would never do that to him, so Jo makes him to cross the border so they can see if Alaric is compelled. Meanwhile, Stefan (Paul Wesley) meets Matt's (Zach Roerig) friend who claims to be Sarah (Gabrielle Walsh), the daughter of their uncle. Later, it is revealed that she is actually an impostor who goes by the name Monique. Stefan knows about the real Sarah and where she is all these years since he has been watching over her whole life so the moment he saw Monique, he knew she was lying. He compels Monique to forget she ever knew Sarah and to leave Mystic Falls, because he does not want Damon, or anyone else, to know about Sarah. Enzo (Michael Malarkey) suspects that Stefan hides something and kills Monique because Stefan refuses to tell him. That makes Matt go to Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) and ask him to help him kill Enzo. At the end of the episode, Alaric, knowing now the truth about Damon compelling him, he confronts him and even though Damon tries to apologize. He hits him and leaves when he finds out that Kai is already free. In the meantime, Bonnie returns to Mystic Falls of 1994 but she does not find Elena and Damon there and starts crying while in present, Kai gets to Tyler's home and tells him that he wants to save Liv's life, asking for Tyler's help. == Feature music == In the episode "I Alone" we can hear the songs: *"Lost" by Kris Allen *"Compass" by Zella Day *"The Woods" by Israel Cannan *"Stepping Stone" by Fly Golden Eagle *"Hey Jealousy" by Gin Blossoms *"Dirty White Boots" by Lenny Kravitz *"Trick Of The Light" by Lonely the Brave *"Mother & Father" by Broods ==Reception== ===Ratings=== In its original American broadcast, "I Alone" was watched by 1.49 million; down by 0.19 from the previous episode. ===Reviews=== "I Alone" received mixed reviews. Stephanie Flasher from TV After Dark gave the episode a B+ rating saying that the episode had a little bit of something for everyone and the writers Brian Young and Holly Brix took viewers on an emotional journey filled with ups and downs. Ashley Dominique of Geeked Out Nation rated the episode with 7.1/10 stating that the episode moved the plot with the Gemini Coven forward, readjusting the tensions within our characters. Jen from TV Overmind rated the episode with 7/10 saying that the episode left her feeling a little uneasy about the second half of the season and the next week's midseason finale. Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3.5/5 stating that the episode was a full hour of good intentions but with poor planning. Sara Ditta from Next Projection rated the episode with 5.7/10 saying that the only characters with any real spark in the episode were Enzo and Kai. "While neither the plot nor characters developed significantly in this episode, the show's baddies brought some fun moments in an episode that mostly sets up next week's midseason finale." Caroline Preece of Den of Geek gave a good review to the episode saying that the show delivered yet another fantastic hour of television. "There are shows, like The Vampire Diaries, that start off pretty terribly before going on to become sizeable hits. They burn hot and bright for a couple of seasons before the complacency sets in and eventually drives even the most enthusiastic fans away. Vampire Diaries was a textbook example of this, and to see it get back to its early quality in its sixth year is fantastic." ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 6) episodes

45338036	I Am They	I Am They is an American Christian music band from Carson City, Nevada, formed in 2011. The band consists of five members and was first signed to Essential Records. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2015. They were most recently signed to Big Future. ==Background== I Am They, a Christian band from Carson City, Nevada was initially formed as a worship ministry called "Solomon's Porch" for what was intended to be a single night worship gathering on October 31, 2008, hosted at Calvary Chapel Carson City. After a positive reception from the local church community, the band continued holding bi- monthly worship gatherings. After receiving an offer from local Christian concert promoters, Ian Bullis and Jonathan Velasquez, to open for CCM artist Matthew West in January 2009, the band began to write original material and formally changed their name to I Am They in order to differentiate it from the bi-monthly worship ministry they hosted. The band signed to Provident Label Group in the summer of 2013 and went into the studio in January 2014 to record their self-titled debut at Yackland Studios in Nashville, TN with Producer Jonathan Smith and Executive Producer Jason Ingram. Their debut album was released on January 27, 2015. In winter and spring of 2015, the band was a part of the national touring "Rock & Worship Roadshow" alongside MercyMe, Crowder, and Group 1 Crew, followed by a tour with Matt Maher on the spring leg of the Saints & Sinners tour. In August 2015, I Am They received a Dove Award nomination for New Artist of the Year. In March 2016, Abbie Parker replaced Stephanie Kulla as the lead female vocalist for the band. On the same day, the band released a new single "Make A Way" featuring Abbie Parker. I AM THEY released the 4-song worship EP The Resting Place - EP in June 2016. In April 2017, a new vocalist, Houston resident Jon McConnell, was introduced with the release of the band's new song, Crown Him. In early 2019, a new drummer/percussionist, Nicole Hickman, joined the group, allowing Sara Palmer to focus on planning and promotion full-time. Nicole had spent a number of years touring with Holly Starr. In January 2022, the band announced that they had signed with Big Future Music Group in a joint venture with Truss Records. The announcement also pictured and listed Cheyenne Mitchell as vocalist, in place of previous lead female vocalist Abbie Parker. ==Members== Current members * Matthew Hein – vocals, guitar, banjo, dobro, mandolin * Cheyenne Mitchell (since January 2022) * Justin Shinn – keys, organ, concert drum, banjo, mandolin, bass * Nicole Hickman (2019–present)– drums, percussion * Brandon Chase (August 2019–present) – vocals, guitar, banjo Former members * Stephanie Kulla (2015) – vocals * Bobby Stiehler – bass, percussion * Raul Aguilar Jr. – bass * Adam Palmer (2015-2019) – vocals, guitar, Nashville high- strung guitar, banjo, dobro, concert drum * Sara Palmer (2015-2019) – drums, percussion * Jon McConnell (until late 2019) – vocals, guitar, keys * Abbie Parker (2016–2021) – vocals, harmonium, keys ==Discography== ===Albums=== List of studio albums, with selected chart positions Title Album details Peak chart positions US Christ UK C & G I Am They * Released: January 27, 2015 * * Format: CD, digital download 10 — Trial & Triumph * Released: March 2, 2018 * * Format: CD, digital download 23 15 Faithful God * Released: October 23, 2020 * Label: Essential Records * Format: CD, digital download 43 — ===Extended plays=== List of EPs Title Details The Prelude *Released: August 2, 2011 *Label: Independent *Format: CD Sanctuaries *Released: February 20, 2013 *Label: Independent *Format: CD, Streaming Resting Place *Released: June 10, 2016 *Label: Provident *Format: Download, Streaming ===Singles=== List of singles and peak chart positions Single Year Peak chart positions Certifications Album US Christ US Christ Air.

45338092	I Am They (album)	I Am They is the first album by I Am They, released on January 27, 2015, on Essential Records. ==Reception== Grace S. Aspinwall, in a three and a half star review, wrote, "A grand collision of folk and worship, I Am They burst forth with a lively and intricate debut album... The Carson City based sextet succeeds on almost every front in their initial release and we can't wait to hear more." In a three star review by Jesus Freak Hideout, Roger Gelwicks wrote, "One listen of I Am They's debut reveals a band that's fully functional but not hitting on all cylinders... For now, I Am They's debut uncovers plenty of holes that experience, and a matured approach, can surely help to fill." Jonathan Francesco, in a three star review in New Release Tuesday, wrote, "While everything is good, solid, vertical worship, there's a little too much reliance on common buzz phrases in worship music... Given another album, this would be easy enough to correct, and the group displays the musical and vocal chops to carry stronger lyrics in the future." Rating the album an eight out of ten for Cross Rhythms, Chris Webb wrote, "Powerful vocals backed by deft interplay between guitars, violin and an occasional burst of banjo are the musical foundation stone of I Am They while their literate lyrics avoid most of the clichés." Awarding the album four and a half stars from 365 Days of Inspiring Media, Jonathan Andre said they "create[d] a worship album worthy to be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates anything about worship, acoustic or even folk music." Lindsay Williams, awarding the album four stars from The Sound Opinion, wrote, "Rollicking foot-stomping abounds on every track. Raucous clapping is encouraged, and singing along is imminent." Rating the album a 4.6 out of five at Christian Music Review, Amanda Brogan says, "In every song, whether foot-stomping or hand-raising, I Am They's passion for the Savior is potent and tangible." Awarding the album ten stars for Jesus Wired, Rebekah Joy wrote that it is, "an incredible worship album". Writing a review for Christian Review Magazine, Leah St. John rated the album four and a half stars, and said, "The whole album exudes an unpretentious, intimate, and peaceful atmosphere." ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart (2015) Peak position ==References== ==External links== * AllMusic * Hallels Category:2015 albums Category:Essential Records (Christian) albums Category:I Am They albums

McClymont recorded the song as her debut single; it was released in Australia on 17 June 2002 as a CD single and peaked at number forty-nine on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart."I Can't Wait - Australian Chart Position".

It was released to mainstream pop radio stations on August 12, 2002. ===Chart performance=== The single received extremely little mainstream radio play, but it had reached number one on Radio Disney in the United States by November 2002, with one station playing the song 850 times over a six-week period.Philips, Chuck. "Playing by the Rules?". Los Angeles Times. 8 November 2002. Retrieved 23 March 2007. The Los Angeles Times reported that music industry critics attributed the success of the single to Buena Vista Records's status as a sister company to Radio Disney, which had an affiliation with Disney Channel. This was believed to be in violation of the Federal Communications Commission's broadcasting rules, which prohibit corporations from using broadcast licenses "for their own benefit or to gain a competitive advantage in any transaction." Media expert Robert McChesney, from the University of Illinois, said it "clearly violates the spirit – if not the letter – of the law. It undermines the integrity of the public airwaves, corroding editorial space with commercial factors. It's very damaging." The Radio Disney head of programming, Robin Jones, said "I Can't Wait" had gone to number one because of requests from listeners and that the radio chain does not deliberately favor acts associated with Disney. Duff herself called the Los Angeles Times article "really mean ... It's funny that you pick on a kid my age because I'm on the Disney Channel, sorry!"Lin, Lynda. "Hilary Duff: A Teenage Sensation" . themovieinsider.com. 20 March 2003. Retrieved 23 March 2007. ===Music video=== Its music video features clips from the show alongside shots of Duff dancing, holding a guitar and singing with soap bubbles and confetti floating around her, and she also performs the song in a mock studio setting. A remix of the song is featured on the "Why Not" (2003) CD single. A music video was also released for the remix. ==Chieko Kawabe version== In 2005, the song was rewritten in Japanese and performed by Chieko Kawabe on her album Brilliance.

Garfinkle and produced by Garfinkle and Band. ==Plot== Robert Kraft is the newly appointed chairman of a committee that oversees a large cemetery. The cemetery caretaker, Andy MacKee, keeps a map in the cemetery office displaying the grounds and each gravesite. Filled graves are marked by black pins and unoccupied but sold graves are marked with white pins. New to the position and unobservant, Kraft accidentally places a pair of black pins where they don't belong, only to discover later that the young couple who had bought the grave sites in question died in an automobile accident soon afterwards. He believes that he marked them for death. Hoping it will give him peace of mind, Robert replaces a random white pin with a black pin. When that person dies later in the week, however, he becomes increasingly convinced that either he or the map wield some kind of dark power. Repeated experiments, undertaken upon the insistence of skeptical friends and co-workers, yield the same result. Kraft slips into deep guilt and depression and believes he is cursed. The police, who are initially skeptical, eventually begin to take notice and, in the hopes that it will reveal the cause of the deaths, ask Robert to place a black pin on the grave of a person who is known to be in France. Although he does so, Robert continues his slide into despair. That same night, he decides that if black pins give him the power of death, white pins might give him the power of life. He replaces all of the recently placed black pins with white pins. When he goes to the associated grave sites later that night, he discovers that all are open, with the bodies gone. Upon returning to the cemetery office, Robert receives a call informing him of the death of the man in France. As he hangs up the phone, the cemetery caretaker comes up behind him, covered in dirt. He reveals that he has been killing all of the marked people as revenge for being forced to retire. However, when Robert informs him of the death of the man in France, the caretaker, who couldn't have killed the man, begins to lose his mind, and collapses. When the police arrive, they find the caretaker dead and tell Robert that the news of the man's death was all a ruse to flush out the cemetery caretaker. ==Cast== * Richard Boone as Robert Kraft * Theodore Bikel as Andy McKee * Peggy Maurer as Ann Craig * Howard Smith as George Kraft * Herbert Anderson as Jess Jessup * Robert Osterloh as Lt. Clayborne ==Production== The film's music was composed by Gerald Fried. The film was shot by Frederick Gately and edited by Frank Sullivan. ==Release== I Bury the Living was released in July 1958 by United Artists. ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 64% based on reviews from 11 critics. SFX critic Ian Berriman noted that I Bury the Living was "basically just like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone, but that's no bad thing, since it's like a good episode". Film Threat said, "With a title like I Bury the Living (1958), one would think this picture should be sleazy 50’s horror fare; a product of Corman or at least AIP, but it is actually a pretty tense little psychological thriller". The review expressed disappointment with the film's ending, but praised its "dark, moody cinematography", "sometimes striking if sparse visual design" and "ominous music". ==Legacy== Horror author Stephen King listed I Bury the Living as one of his favorite films in his 1981 non-fiction book Danse Macabre, but criticized the ending.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051755/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv In the foreword to King's short story "Obits", published in 2015 in his The Bazaar of Bad Dreams collection, he referenced I Bury the Living and noted that the story was inspired by the film. Morrissey recorded the track "I Bury The Living", co-written by Jesse Tobias on his 2017 album Low in High School. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Filmschatten film online Category:1958 horror films Category:1958 films Category:American psychological horror films Category:Films set in cemeteries Category:Films scored by Gerald Fried Category:United Artists films Category:Films directed by Albert Band Category:1950s English-language films Category:1950s American films

It stars Christopher Lloyd, Max Records, Laura Fraser, and Christina Baldwin. Shooting began in Virginia, Minnesota, on 28 February 2015. It premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on 13 March 2016, and received limited theatrical and video on demand release on 26 August. ==Plot== John Wayne Cleaver, a teenager in a small Midwestern town, has been diagnosed as a sociopath and harbors homicidal impulses, which are exacerbated by working at his mother April's funeral home. He controls his urges with strict rules, mental stopgaps, and speaking to his therapist Grant. At the scene of a murder, John sees a puddle of black oil. After an identical murder, talk of a serial killer piques John's interest. While out trick-or-treating with his friend Max, John spots a drifter lurking outside his neighbor Bill Crowley's house. At the high-school Halloween dance, John scares off a bully by threatening to kill him. After discussing this with Grant, John sees the drifter join Crowley on an ice fishing trip, and John follows them. As the drifter is about to attack Crowley, Crowley suddenly kills the man with his bare hand, which morphs into a branch-like shape. Crowley cuts out his own lungs and replaces them with the man's. John creates a serial killer profile, noting every victim had organs removed. While following Crowley and his wife, Kay, on their date night, he comes across his mother and Grant having dinner, upsetting John. John studies fairytales and mystic folklore, and the police connect the recent murders to a missing person named Emmett Openshaw. John follows Crowley to a barbershop owned by Greg, a man who danced with Kay the previous night because Crowley was limping. After seeing Crowley attack Greg, John impulsively sets off the barbershop's alarm, drawing two police officers, who Crowley kills. Afterward, Crowley no longer limps and appears to be rejuvenated. Before leaving, Crowley nonchalantly answers a phone call from Kay. John sees a puddle of black oil and realizes it was Crowley's old leg, which he swapped with Greg's. After leaving Crowley an anonymous note revealing his knowledge, John overhears Kay say Crowley has been housebound for a week. As John visits Crowley at Kay's request, Crowley recites and explains William Blake's poems "The Lamb" and "The Tyger". John continues to profile Crowley, who grows weaker. On Christmas Eve, John calls Crowley from a pay phone to ask about the process and what he stole from Openshaw. Crowley gives vague answers, and John realizes Crowley was stalling. Seeing Crowley's car, John flees to Max's house. After John reveals their friendship was merely a coping mechanism, Max throws out John. John stumbles upon Crowley killing Max's father; John, wearing a ski mask, fails to stop Crowley and flees. After Max's father's memorial, April tries to connect with John, who threatens her life when she pushes him. After a conversation with Grant, John waits until Crowley leaves the house and tries to scare him away by threatening what he loves most: Kay. When John believes he has unintentionally killed Kay, he panics and calls Grant. After seeing she is still alive, John leaves the house as Crowley arrives. In Crowley's car, he finds Grant's intact body, which he hides. The next morning, Crowley realizes John has taken the body. At Max's father's funeral, Crowley reveals Grant had been out looking for John. John says Crowley will not try anything in public and observes that Crowley's heart will not last much longer. After the funeral, John realizes his mother did not leave; he finds her unconscious on the embalming table beside Crowley, who demands John return Grant's body. John pretends to agree but knocks out Crowley. After April regains consciousness, they hook Crowley up to the embalming device. When Crowley wakes, the lights flicker, and a large, black, oily monster slides out of his body. Realizing he can no longer be with Kay, he asks John to watch over her and commits suicide. Both Crowley and the monster's corpses melt into black oil. Afterwards, the police find Grant's body, and Crowley is reported missing. John comforts Kay, who tells him the story of how she and Bill fell in love, making John realize he must find happiness, too. John and his mother later have a casual conversation as they embalm Grant's body. ==Cast== *Christopher Lloyd as Bill Crowley *Max Records as John Wayne Cleaver *Laura Fraser as April Cleaver *Tim Russell as Greg Olson the barber *Christina Baldwin as Aunt Margaret *Karl Geary as Dr. Grant Neblin *Anna Sundberg as Lauren Bacall Cleaver *Lucy Lawton as Brooke *Raymond Branstrom as Max Bowen *Dee Noah as Kay Crowley *Michael Paul Levin as Roger Bowen *Jim Gaulke as Principal Layton ==Production== Author Dan Wells' novel I Am Not a Serial Killer was first released in 2009 and in the United States in 2010.

46325002	I Believe in Your Sweet Love	"I Believe in Your Sweet Love" is a song recorded by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler. It was released as a standalone single in November 1979, and Tyler later re-recorded it for her fourth studio album, Goodbye to the Island (1981). The song was written by Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe, who co-produced the track with Hugh Murphy. The song was a hit in Canada, where it reached number 27 on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart. Record Mirror nominated it as a single of the week upon its release. == Background == Tyler's success was in decline (except in Scandinavian countries) after she failed to match the success of her 1978 single "It's a Heartache" with subsequent releases. Diamond Cut (1979) only reached number 145 in the United States, and its most successful singles "Too Good to Last" and "My Guns Are Loaded" only saw regional success in mainland Europe and Canada. Tyler released two singles in late 1979: "Sitting on the Edge of the Ocean", which saw her win the World Popular Song Festival in Japan; and "I Believe in Your Sweet Love". "I Believe in Your Sweet Love" was also released on Tyler's album Lost in France: The Early Years (2005). == Music video == The video was filmed in Beaulieu Palace House in Brockenhurst, United Kingdom. == Charts == Chart (1979–80) Peak position Canada AC (RPM) 27 US (Record World) 138 ==External links== Lyrics to this song at Genius == References == Category:1979 singles Category:Bonnie Tyler songs Category:Songs written by Ronnie Scott (songwriter) Category:Songs written by Steve Wolfe
46401080	I Am Not Sidney Poitier	I Am Not Sidney Poitier is a novel by Percival Everrett that was published in 2009 by Graywolf Press. In 2020, it was published by Influx Press in the UK. It follows the tumultuous life of a character named Not Sidney Poitier as the social hierarchy scrambles to balance his skin color with his wealth. Each adventure mirrors a prominent Sidney Poitier film, such as The Defiant Ones or Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, and incorporates a significant twist. The novel reflects a Post-black writing style by parodying the traditions of Black literature. == Plot summary == === Chapter 1 === The novel begins with the conception of Not Sidney Poitier, a boy whose mother, Portia, invests in Turner Broadcasting on the ground floor. She gains quite a lot of money when it becomes successful. Ted Turner comes to visit her and meets Not Sidney. Portia dies soon after the meeting, which allows Ted to become Not Sidney's guardian. Ted gives Not Sidney free rein over his money and life, to avoid the white savior stereotype. Not Sidney is educated by a socialist college student named Betty. Not Sidney is also heavily bullied, and in order to combat this bullying, he attempts to learn martial arts. When that fails, he learns how to "fesmerize" people, which is an ability that is akin to hypnosis, and uses that ability to mess with Ted, Betty, and Ted's wife, Jane Fonda. Upon reaching high school age, Not Sidney decides to attend public school. He develops a crush on his teacher, which she notices. She invites him to her home, where she sexually assaults him on two separate occasions. She threatens to fail him if he doesn't allow it, though after the second time, she fails him anyway. Not Sidney attempts to report this, but is ridiculed by the administration both at his individual school and at the Board of Education. As a result, he drops out and decides to go on a journey to California. === Chapter 2 === Not Sidney attempts to drive cross-country to California, but he is stopped and arrested because he is Black. He is put into prison unlawfully. While being transported to another facility, the bus he's riding on crashes, and Not Sidney and the prisoner he's chained to, Patrice, escape. He and Patrice head back to Atlanta on foot. After some time, they get into a fight and are interrupted by a young boy named Bobo. Bobo takes them to the house where he lives with his blind older sister, Sis. After being taken into their home, they all plan to jump atop the train headed back to Atlanta the next morning. While they sleep, Not Sidney has the "Band of Angels" dream, in which he is a slave named Raz-ru. In the dream, he watches a high-yella woman be taken from her high-society life and be bought by his master, who Not Sidney eventually kills. The next day, Sis and Patrice begin a romantic relationship, and begin drinking to celebrate. That night, they drink themselves to sleep. When the sun rises, Not Sidney opts to leave them sleeping and ride the train to Atlanta on his own. This chapter was inspired by the movies The Defiant Ones, A Patch of Blue, and Band of Angels === Chapter 3 === Upon returning from his failed cross-country trip, Not Sidney decides that he wants to go to college, and sets up a meeting with Gladys Feet. He bribes Gladys Feet with a donation to Morehouse College for a place in the upcoming class. He's placed in a room with Morris Chesney, a fraternity brother who attempts to bully and haze Not Sidney and others while they rush the fraternity. To end their ongoing conflict, Not Sidney fesmerizes him into reorienting the fraternity around recycling and leaving him alone. While at Morehouse, he attends classes taught by Percival Everett. Not Sidney goes to his office hours, and develops a mentor/mentee relationship with him after Everett reveals that he is a fraud. While attending Everett's classes, Not Sidney meets Maggie, a Spelmanite, and they begin a relationship. === Chapter 4 === Not Sidney goes home with Maggie from Morehouse for Thanksgiving. He finds out that her family are a group of Black conservatives who are bigoted against Black people with darker skin. While there, Not Sidney experiences a series of microaggressions and is hit on by Agnes, Maggie's sister, who sleeps with him to upset Maggie. During their sexual encounter, Not Sidney has the "No Way Out" dream, where he is a doctor who loses a white patient who is not able to be saved and is blamed for his death. Near the end of the visit, Maggie's parents find out about Not Sidney's vast sums of money, and begin to treat him with a near- reverent respect. After recognizing this, Not Sidney calls them out about their colorism and causes a scene at Thanksgiving dinner. This results in him leaving their house and ending things with Maggie. This chapter was inspired by the movies Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and No Way Out === Chapter 5 === After dropping out of Morehouse, Not Sidney attempts to drive cross-country to California again, and this time his car begins to break down in the small Alabama town of Smuteye. He pulls into the driveway of a small house, looking for tools to use to fix the car. The nuns living there offer their tools, but ask him to fix their leaking roof in exchange. The sisters become convinced that Not Sidney has been sent by God to help them build their church and tell him he will be building a fence the following day. He goes to sleep, and has the "Uncle Buck and the Preacher" dream, in which he is Buck, the leader of a wagon train of newly freed slaves in the west who are running from a posse of army men who want them to work their land. He steals a horse from a preacher in order to escape. It backfires and the preacher punches Not Sidney in the face. Upon waking, the sisters tell him again about their conviction that he will build their church, but Not Sidney is not convinced. He uses their tools to fix his car and leaves. He stops at the Smuteye Diner to ease his hunger. He hears the waitress and patrons ridicule the sisters, so he decides to help them build the church with his vast sums of money. He returns, and after some struggles to obtain cash for his check, Not Sidney cashes the check in Montgomery with a clerk named Mr. Scrunchy. On his way back, he witnesses a Klan rally from the safety of his car, and watches the cross burn out before he leaves. This chapter was inspired by the movies Lilies of the Field and Uncle Buck and the Preacher === Chapter 6 === He returns to the nuns with the money, but finds they have hired a suspicious architect who clearly plans to abscond with the money. Because of his suspicions, Not Sidney only gives them a portion of the money, then goes to the diner only to be arrested for a murder he did not commit. He calls Ted Turner and Percival Everett for help, and they come down to rescue him. After being freed from prison, he finds that the person who was murdered looked exactly like him, and wonders if that was the real Sidney Poitier. A massive tornado starts to form as he returns to the nuns' house, and he sees Mr. Scrunchy and Sister Iranaeus shoveling his money into a bag. They run, and Not Sidney moves to apprehend them, but when he finds them, they are both dead after their truck hits a pole. Not Sidney gets his money back, and decides to resume his trip to California by plane. This chapter was inspired by the movies They Call Me Mr. Tibbs! and In the Heat of the Night === Chapter 7 === Not Sidney flies to San Francisco, where he is met with press and a limousine, and is whisked away to an award show. He has truly become Sidney Poitier, and wins an award for a performance of his. In his acceptance speech, he references the fact that they are strangers to him, and dedicates the award to his mom, whose grave he has left unmarked. The words that end the book, his speech, and will stand on his mother's grave are: I Am Not Myself Today. == Major characters == The following main characters are listed in order of appearance: *Not Sidney Poitier, the protagonist *Portia Poitier, Not Sidney's mother *Ted Turner, head of Turner Broadcasting and Not Sidney's de facto guardian *Betty, Not Sidney's socialist teacher and mentor *Podgy Patel, Not Sidney's accountant *Miss Hancock, Not Sidney's high school teacher who sexually assaults him *Patrice, a racist convict who is chained to Not Sidney when the prison bus crashes *Sis, a racist blind girl Not Sidney and Patrice run into *Bobo, Sis' little brother *Mrs. Feet, an admissions officer from Morehouse who is attracted to Not Sidney and bribes him *Percival Everett, a fraudulent Morehouse professor who likes Sidney and enters into a mentoring relationship with him *Maggie Larkin, Not Sidney's first girlfriend *Agnes Larkin, Maggie's sister *The Larkins, Maggie's conservative parents. *Violet, their maid *Sister Iranaeus, the lead nun at the house where Not Sidney's car breaks down *Thornton Scrunchy, a scam artist who conspires to steal the funds for the church *The Chief, the racist chief of police of Smuteye who arrests Not Sidney and Everett == Themes == === Identity crisis === I Am Not Sidney Poitier exhibits the identity crisis associated with racial performances. In the novel, Not Sidney can never find his true self because Everett designed him to be a caricature of Sidney Poitier. He was constantly forced into a mold that eluded him; creating, as Christian Schmidt states in his essay The Parody of Postblackness...,"a mere negation of self," because, as he continues, "without Sidney, Not Sidney would not exist." Michael Buening, an editor from PopMatters, attaches this idea to the confusion that many Black men feel during situations in which they can't escape the expectations that come with their skin. From this, Buening concludes that Everett's parodied trope characterizes the experience of life for Black men as a journey of immense searching. === Post-blackness/Parody of Black literature === In the novel, Everett engages with several aspects of traditional Black literature through parody: "Playfully engaging the fiction of Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright, and intertextually invoking his own literary oeuvre, Everett's I Am Not Sidney Poitier signifies upon the history of African American literature and can fruitfully be read as a parody of it. Following Hutcheon, I use parody not in the narrow sense of 'ridiculing imitation' (A Theory 5) but as a term to describe complex forms of 'trans- contextualization' and inversion." This approach is characteristic of many "Post-black" authors. These authors create worlds in which race may or may not be relevant, but does not totally control or define the story. By doing so, these authors change the view of "Black literature", and try to establish that Black authors are capable of creating stories that are not entirely about the concept of race. == Critical reception == I Am Not Sidney Poitier received a warm reception among its few reviewers, and won two awards: the Believer Book Award and the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award. Everett's supporters lauded his absurdist comedic approach in creating a character that "negates" everything he is intended to represent. An essay by assistant professor Christian Schmidt from the University of Bayreuth defines the novel as a "meta parody that thematizes the very difference between original and copy even if the sign that marks this difference is as crude and banal as the simple 'not' of its protagonist's name." This attribute of the novel, along with its experimental and fractured lens of Not Sidney, create the "coded discourse" necessary for parody to thrive. Critics, including Schmidt, recognized Everett's emphasis on parody and noted instances such as his 2009 Fuck were discredited by many "intratextual critiques". I Am Not Sidney Poitier has been classified as a part of "Post-black literature", where Black novels parody/respond to the genre of Black literature. These authors write worlds that are entirely dependent on the text itself, and as such do not address the racism outside of it. NPR called the story a "delicious comedy of miscommunications" and "one of the funniest, most original stories to be published in years." Publishers Weeklys review lauded Everett as "a novelist at the height of his narrative and satirical powers" and the novel as "smart and without a trace of pretentiousness". Kirkus Reviews said about the book: "The author had some fun; the reader will too." ==References== Category:2009 American novels Category:Believer Book Award-winning books Category:Graywolf Press books Category:African-American novels
46407475	I Am (Leona Lewis song)	"I Am" is a song by British singer and songwriter Leona Lewis from her fifth studio album of the same name. The song was written by Lewis, Toby Gad and Eg White, with Gad and White producing it. Lyrically, "I Am" is about the feelings and emotions experienced by Lewis following her departure from her former record label Syco and its boss, Simon Cowell. It is a dance-influenced track which makes use of strings, piano and drums as part of its instrumentation. Its composition garnered comparisons to singers Avril Lavigne and Massive Attack. Island released "I Am" on 17 July 2015 as the lead single for the United Kingdom, but it is the second single to be released from the album overall. Remixes by Fastlane and DEVolution were also released. The track garnered a positive response from music critics, many of whom praised Lewis' strong and emotive vocal performance and described it as a standout on the album. Lewis has performed the song live on The National Lottery: In It to Win It and at the BBC's Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park festival. ==Background and composition== "I Am" was written by Leona Lewis, Toby Gad and Eg White, with Gad and White producing the track, for Lewis's fifth studio album of the same name (2015). It was published by ASCAP and Atlas Music publishings (on behalf of itself and Gadfly Songs (ASCAP) and Kobalt Music Group Ltd. White performed much of the song's instrumentation, and is credited with playing the piano, drums, bass and bells, as well as the string and drum programming. The strings were recorded by White and Kristian Larsen in Studio A at Kensaltown Studios, and were arranged by White, transcribed by Clarissa Farran, and contracted by Hilary Skewes. The violins were played by Marije Johnston, Kotono Sato, Max Baillie, Bea Lovejoy, Warren Zielinksi, Janice Graham, Helen Paterson and Hannah Dawson. Meghan Cassidy and James Boyd played the viola, while David Cohen and Ben Chappell played the cello. "I Am" was mixed by Wez Clarke, with additional mixing carried out by Gad at Kite Music Studios in Los Angeles. The track's audio was mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound studios in New York City, with assistance from Randy Merrill. Lewis provided all of the vocals for the track. For the acoustic version of "I Am", Gad undertook all of the instrumentation and also performed the mixing. "I Am" is a dance-influenced song. Some critics believe the lyrics allude to Lewis' emotions and feelings following her departure from Syco Records and Simon Cowell, her former label boss and friend. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner felt that the title track had very few barriers, exemplified by the lyrics "I am, with or without you / I am, breathing without you / I am, somebody without you." Lewis performs the lyrics over an instrumentation of "rousing" strings and breakbeats. As she sings "I won't change for you," a heavy drum beat and occasional piano chimes reminiscent of songs by Avril Lavigne are played. ==Release and remixes== On 30 June 2015, Lewis released a three-minute teaser video with snippets of "I Am", "Ladders, "Power" and "Thunder". "I Am" was released as the second single from the album and lead single for the United Kingdom; it was not promoted in the United States due to the decision to release the album's third overall single "Thunder" as its lead single instead. The full length version of "I Am" premiered on BBC Radio 2 on 17 July 2015. The same day, the track was made available as an automatic download for anyone who had previously pre-ordered the album. A two-track remix EP with dance remixes by Fastlane and DEVolution was also made available as a digital download on 17 July in the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, and New Zealand. "I Am" was added to BBC Radio 2's B-list playlist on 15 August. ==Critical reception== Kathy Iandoli of Idolator highlighted "I Am" as a "gorgeous standout" example of Lewis' ability to "just [sing]" a song as opposed to using auto-tune on "Power" and over-singing on "I Got You". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy felt that the track put "Simon [Cowell] in his place in a way Louis Walsh could only dream of." Brad O'Mance for Popjustice likened the song to Massive Attack's 1991 song "Unfinished Sympathy" "with a different song on top", while Official Charts Company writer Rob Copsey described it as "gutsy and uplifting". However, Michael Clemons of The Daily Reveille thought that while it was not a stand out track, it was a good listen. Chuck Campbell of Knoxville News Sentinel thought that the track's lyrical theme, and the album's theme as a whole, was flawed as a concept, writing "The problem with repeatedly declaring you don’t need the approval of someone who has wronged you is that your message is false. Clearly if Lewis indulges in six straight bitter songs about defiantly rebounding from a bad relationship (which she does on “I Am”), she obviously craves validation from the very person (or people) who did her dirty." ==Live performance== Lewis performed "I Am" for the first time during a live showcase at the Hospital Club in London on 14 April 2015. The singer premiered four other tracks from I Am including "Ladders", "I Got You", "Thank You" and "Fire Under My Feet". Stefan Kyriazis of the Daily Star described "I Am" and "Ladders" as "instant crowd pleasers". Lewis later performed the track live on The National Lottery: In It to Win It on 12 September 2015, and again the following day at the BBC's Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park festival. The set- list also included performances of "Better in Time", "Bleeding Love", "Run", "Fire Under My Feet" and "I Got You". "I Am" was included as the opening song on her 2016 concert tour of the same name. ==Formats and versions== ;Digital download – album version * "I Am" – 3:42 ;Digital download – acoustic album version * "I Am" 3:26 ;Digital download – I Am Remixes #"I Am" (Fastlane remix) – 4:44 #"I Am" (DEVolution remix) – 4:51 ==Personnel== Credits sourced from album booklet and liner. *Leona Lewis - vocals, composer *Ben Chappell - cello *David Cohen - cello *Hilary Skews - strings (contractor) *Wez Clarke - mixing *Toby Gad - additional mixing, composer *Eg White - piano, strings programming, drum programming, bass, bells, recording (strings), arranger (strings), composer *Kristian Larsen - recording (strings) *Clarissa Farran - strings transcription *James Boyd - viola *Meghan Cassidy - viola *Bea Lovejoy - violin *Hannah Dawson - violin *Helen Paterson - violin *Janice Graham - violin *Kotono Sato - violin *Marije Johnston - violin *Max Baillie - violin *Warren Zielinski - violin ==Release history== Country Version Date Format Label United Kingdom Original 17 July 2015 Radio premiere Island Automatic download (From album pre-order) Australia Remix EP Digital download France Germany Ireland New Zealand United Kingdom Original 15 August 2015 BBC Radio 2 B-list playlist ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2015 singles Category:2015 songs Category:Leona Lewis songs Category:Island Records singles Category:Songs written by Toby Gad Category:Songs written by Leona Lewis Category:Song recordings produced by Toby Gad Category:Songs written by Eg White

466502	I Am a Cat	is a satirical novel written in 1905–1906 by Natsume Sōseki about Japanese society during the Meiji period (1868–1912), particularly the uneasy mix of Western culture and Japanese traditions. Sōseki's title, Wagahai wa Neko de Aru, uses a very high-register phrasing more appropriate to a nobleman, conveying grandiloquence and self-importance. This is somewhat ironic, since the speaker, an anthropomorphized domestic cat, is a regular house cat of a teacher, and not of a high-ranking noble as the manner of speech suggests, an example of Sōseki's love for droll writing. The book was first published in ten installments in the literary journal Hototogisu. At first, Sōseki intended only to write the short story that constitutes the first chapter of I Am a Cat. However, Takahama Kyoshi, one of the editors of Hototogisu, persuaded Sōseki to serialize the work, which evolved stylistically as the installments progressed. Nearly all the chapters can stand alone as discrete works. ==Plot summary== In I Am a Cat, a supercilious, feline narrator describes the lives of an assortment of middle-class Japanese people: Mr. This is the spelling used in the abridged translation by Aiko Itō and Graeme Wilson. ("sneeze" is misspelled on purpose, but literally translated from , in the original Japanese) and family (the cat's owners), Sneaze's garrulous and irritating friend , and the young scholar with his will-he-won't-he courtship of the businessman's spoiled daughter, . ==Cultural impact== I Am a Cat is a frequent assignment to Japanese schoolchildren, such that the plot and style remain well-known long after publication. One effect was that the narrator's manner of speech, which was archaic even at the time of writing, became largely associated with the cat and the book. The narrator's preferred personal pronoun, wagahai, is rarely-to-never used in "real life" in Japan, but survives in fiction thanks to the book, generally for arrogant and pompous anthropomorphized animals. For example, Bowser, the turtle-king enemy in many Mario series video games, uses wagahai, as does Morgana, a cat character in Persona 5. ==Adaptations== The novel was first adapted into a film released in 1936. Later, prolific screenwriter Toshio Yasumi adapted the novel into a screenplay, and a second film was directed by Kon Ichikawa. It premiered in Japanese cinemas in 1975. An anime television special adaptation aired in 1982. ==Footnotes== ==External links== * Full text (Kyūjitai and Historical kana orthography) at Aozora Bunko * Full text (Shinjitai and Modern kana usage) at Aozora Bunko * (in English, translated by Kan-ichi Ando, 1906) (pdf) I Am a Cat, Chapter I & Chapter II (English, 1906) * (excerpt) * Soseki Project (resources for reading Sōseki's works in their original Japanese form) ; Adaptations * * * * * * Wagahai wa Neko de Aru (1982) at allcinema Category:1906 novels Category:Fiction with unreliable narrators Category:Japanese comedy novels Category:Japanese novels adapted into films Category:Japanese satirical novels Category:Novels about cats Category:Novels by Natsume Sōseki Category:Novels set in Japan Category:Tuttle Publishing books

46899865	I Can See Your Voice (South Korean TV series)	I Can See Your Voice (abbreviated as ICSYV) () is a South Korean television mystery music game show series jointly produced by CJ ENM and Signal Entertainment Group. Since its premiere on February 26, 2015, it has aired ten seasons on two different networks — Mnet and tvN. == Gameplay == ===Format=== Presented with a group of six "mystery singers" identified only by their occupation, a guest artist must attempt to eliminate bad singers from the group without ever hearing them sing, assisted by clues and a celebrity panel over the course of three rounds. At the end of the game, the last remaining mystery singer is revealed as either good or bad by means of a duet between them and one of the guest artists. The original version has two different formats: *Original format :Under the original format, the guest artists can eliminate one or two mystery singers in each round, and the last mystery singer standing will perform a duet. *Star Wars format (season 1, special only) :Under the "Star Wars" format, ten former mystery singers were separated into two teams. For each round, a mystery singer is chosen for a "showdown". Afterward, voting is done through audience majority, and the votes are accumulated for the winning team. ===Rewards=== The winning mystery singer is awarded on the following conditions: *If the singer is good, he/she will have release a digital single. **In Global Stars special as a prelude to the fifth season, the winning singer, regardless of being good or bad, receives a microphone trophy. *If the singer is bad, he/she wins . ===Rounds=== Each episode presents the guest artist with six people whose identities and singing voices are kept concealed until they are eliminated to perform on the "stage of truth" or remain in the end to perform the final duet. Inside a semi- enclosed podium, the identity and appearance of a sixth participant (as "surprise" mystery singer) remains concealed, until its revelation by being eliminated or a duet performance by one of the guest artists. _Notes:_ ==Production== In 2012, producer and creator Lee Seon-young planned to develop a music game show. Besides with the existence of "good singers", she added "bad singers" and lip sync as format elements. Also, she was originally envisioned a program that will allow anyone to be the main character regardless of their appearances, and was inspired by Kim Bum-soo who struggled to gain recognition because of his look. ==Broadcast history== ===2015—2016: Yoo Se-yoon, Leeteuk, and Kim Bum-soo era=== In a span of three seasons, the show's hosts consist of an original lineup with Yoo Se-yoon, Leeteuk (of Super Junior), and Kim Bum-soo. I Can See Your Voice made its debut broadcast, premiering the first season on February 26, 2015. Despite poor reception, it did continue anyway for a second season that premiered on October 22, 2015. Also on his last hosting tenure with Kim Bum-soo, the third season premiered on June 30, 2016. ===2017—2023: Yoo Se-yoon, Leeteuk, and Kim Jong-kook era=== In a span of seven seasons, Kim Jong-kook became the show's new host, while retaining the original hosting lineup of Yoo Se-yoon and Leeteuk. For various reasons, Lee Sang-min, Cha Tae-hyun, and Hyojung (of Oh My Girl) are also appointed as interim hosts. Host Kim Jong-kook became the guest artist on fourth season premiere on March 2, 2017. Regular episodes have started for the fifth season on February 2, 2018. It was followed by four consecutive annually-held seasons having premiered in a same month — sixth season on January 18, 2019, seventh season on January 17, 2020, eighth season on January 29, 2021, and ninth season on January 29, 2022. This occurrence was ended when the tenth season premiered on March 22, 2023. ===Special episodes=== Star Wars, a postseason game ruled under team-oriented battle featuring mystery singers from the past, took place on May 14, 2015, one week after the first- season finale. As a prelude to the fifth season, Block B played in the Global Stars special, a regular game featuring mystery singers from local or regional ICSYV counterparts on January 26, 2018. After each season finale, the Postseason Showcase featured some of mystery singers returning to perform one last time, as well as rankings on mystery singers' performances for the past seasons, including the current one, which was held on fourth and fifth seasons. ==Cast== The series employs a panel of celebrities who assist the guest artist(s) to decipher mystery singers' evidences throughout the game. Alongside main and additional cast, guest panelists also appear since the first season. Overall, 23 different members have been assigned, with the original lineup being Kim Sang-hyuk (of Click-B), Ben, Julian Quintart, and . Beside them, later members joining on that team also include Han Hee-jun, Lee Sang-min, (from second season); Jang Do-yeon (from third season); Joon Park (of g.o.d), Shindong (of Super Junior) (from fourth season); Jang Dong-min, DinDin (from sixth season); , Sleepy (of Untouchable) (from seventh season); Heo Kyung-hwan, Jang Wooyoung (of 2PM), Hanhae, Mijoo (of Lovelyz) (from eighth season); Eun Ji-won (of Sechs Kies), Kim Na-young (from ninth season); Hwang Chi-yeul, Park Myung-soo, and (from tenth season).

4690839	I Believe (Marcella Detroit song)	"I Believe" is a song by American singer-songwriter Marcella Detroit, released on February 28, 1994, via London Records as the lead single from her second studio album, Jewel (1994). Written by Detroit and produced by Chris Thomas, the song went on to become Detroit's most successful single, peaking at number 11 in the United Kingdom, and achieved similar success internationally. Its highest peak on a national chart was in Australia, where it reached number 10. German singer Joana Zimmer covered this song and released it as a single in 2005. Her version was more successful than Detroit's in German-speaking countries, reaching the top 10 in Austria and Germany and number 13 in Switzerland. ==Critical reception== Aaron Badgley from AllMusic felt that songs like "I Believe" are "powerful songs, with great melodic hooks that stick after just one listening." Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, "Shakespear's Sister siren steps solo with an airy pop ballad that shows recently undisplayed vocal depth and power. Detroit can move mountains with a restrained whisper, and shatter glass with a rapturous bellow—both of which we get here. Fleshed-out, lush synths and plucky sitar riffs will remind some of Annie Lennox's Diva musings in the most positive way, while others will tap into the unique style that Detroit has developed. A multiformat smash is in the offing." In his review of Jewel, Johnny Huston from Entertainment Weekly said, "Marcella Detroit has a gift for perverse lyrics and a voice like Mariah Carey with a head cold, and she pouts and poses impressively in the role of tragic diva." Chuck Campbell from Knoxville News Sentinel felt the singer "grandstands in rather typical fashion on the love song".Campbell, Chuck (August 12, 1994). "Jackyl's 'Push' Should Be Shoved Off The Shelves". Knoxville News Sentinel. In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton complimented it as a "gorgeous ballad". A reviewer from Music & Media commented, "'Hello, turn your radio on' because this solo debut of the American half out of Shakespears Sister is the perfect pop single. The intro is superb for talkative jocks, and so is the outro—if they can still find the words after the most stunning chorus in a long time." An editor, Robbert Tilli, wrote, "With "I Believe" Detroit delivered the "perfect pop single" with the right eyecatching artwork, showing her with a Philip Tracey-designed glove-shaped hat, as if the muse herself is putting her supportive hand on her head." Alan Jones from Music Week gave it four out of five and named it Pick of the Week, stating that Detroit makes her solo debut with "a stylish, self- penned swayer. After a low-key start, it builds admirably, and has an insidious chorus. Radio is already on board, and retail success is just a matter of time. Fab." Tom Doyle from Smash Hits gave the song three out of five, saying, "This is a properly played, properly sung, moody in the verses, rock belter in the choruses type of tune and it's all pleasant enough. Even if it does somehow remind you of that goldie oldie "China In Your Hand" by rock titans of yesteryear, T'Pau." ==Music video== A black-and-white music video was made to accompany the song, directed by Big T.V. It features Skin from Skunk Anansie in a small role as a runner. The video depicts Detroit standing in a field, by some abandoned buildings where various people appears. She sings while she is looking up at a light that are shining down on her. As the video progress, people come running, surrounding the singer, and also they starts looking up in the sky. As more and more people joins the crowd, it gets larger and larger. It starts raining, and everybody leaves except for Detroit, who falls to her knees. As the video ends, the light is still shining down on her, through the rain. ==Track listings== * US cassette single # "I Believe" – 4:51 # "Shadow" – 3:43 * UK and Australian CD single # "I Believe" – 4:50 # "Shadow" – 3:30 # "I Want to Take You Higher" – 3:29 * UK 7-inch and cassette single, European CD single # "I Believe" – 4:50 # "I Want to Take You Higher" – 3:29 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1994) Peak position Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 19 Europe (European AC Radio) 21 Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40) 26 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 Tipparade) 12 Netherlands (Single Top 100 Tipparade) 9 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1994) Position Australia (ARIA) 73 ===Certifications and sales=== ==Joana Zimmer version== In 2005, German singer Joana Zimmer covered the song and released it as "I Believe (Give a Little Bit)" on Polydor Records as her debut single.

In his autobiography, George Jones printed the first six lines of the song and stated, "Its lyrics couldn't be more simple - or profound." ==Recording and composition== According to Colin Escott's 2004 book Hank Williams: The Biography, fiddler Jerry Rivers always claimed that Hank wrote the song in the touring Sedan, and when he came up with the opening line, "Today I passed you on the street," and then asked for suggestions, steel guitarist Don Helms replied, "And I smelled your rotten feet." The song was recorded at Castle Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, on March 16, 1951, and issued as MGM catalog No. 10961. Williams was backed on the session by members of his Drifting Cowboys band, including: Rivers, Helms, Sammy Pruett (electric guitar), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), Ernie Newton or "Cedric Rainwater" aka Howard Watts (bass), and either Owen Bradley or producer Fred Rose on piano. It was released as the B-side of "Howlin' at the Moon", but on the strength of its simple language and passionate singing, soared to number two on the Billboard Country Singles chart. Williams sang the song with Anita Carter on the Kate Smith Evening Hour on April 23, 1952. The rare television appearance is one of the few film clips of Williams in performance. ==Chart performance== Chart (1951) Peak position U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles 2 == Notable cover versions == Many artists have covered the song.

47110186	I Am Woman (album)	I Am Woman is the third studio album by Australian–American pop singer Helen Reddy, released on 13 November 1972, by Capitol Records. The album included her second recording of the song that gave the album its name, which was also the version that spent a week at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.. The album debuted on the Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart in the issue dated December 9, 1972, and reached number 14 during a 62-week run,. and in Canada's RPM magazine it peaked at number seven. On March 7, 1973, the Recording Industry Association of America awarded the album with Gold certification for sales of 500,000 copies in the United States, and Platinum certification for sales of one million copies came on December 5, 1991.RIAA Gold and Platinum Search for titles by Helen Reddy On July 22, 2003, it was released for the first time on compact disc as one of two albums on one CD, the other album being her 1973 release Long Hard Climb. ==Background== ===Singles=== The song "I Am Woman" was originally written for and included on Reddy's 1971 debut album, I Don't Know How to Love Him, but, because of its length and arrangement, she thought it "clearly was not hit-single material.". When it was selected for use in the 1972 film Stand Up and Be Counted, her record company wanted a longer version to release as a 45 in conjunction with the opening of the film.. The new recording of the song, produced by Jay Senter, was done at Sunwest Recording Studio, Los Angeles, California,"The Anthem and the Angst", Sunday Magazine, Melbourne Sunday Herald Sun/Sydney Sunday Telegraph, June 15, 2003, Page 16. on April 23, 1972,(2020) Album notes for I Am Woman/Long Hard Climb by Helen Reddy, [back card]. Watford, UK: Vocalion. and was made available on May 22 of that year.(2006) The Woman I Am: The Definitive Collection by Helen Reddy [CD booklet]. Los Angeles: Capitol Records 09463-57613-2-0. Reddy has summarized the response to the song from most disc jockeys that she experienced as, "'I can't stand this record! I hate this song! But you know, it's a funny thing, my wife loves it!'". Her husband- manager Jeff Wald landed her 19 appearances on various television shows where she could perform it, and "women began calling radio stations and requesting the song, thereby forcing airplay.". Other tracks, such as "Peaceful", were recorded at recording engineer Armin Steiner's Sound Labs Studio, Los Angeles, California, for Reddy's album, which would be named after her aforementioned single. It wasn't until almost seven months later, in the December 9 issue of Billboard magazine, that it sat atop the list of the 100 most popular songs in the US, and on December 18 it earned Gold certification for sales of the one million copies that was the requirement for singles at that time. It also spent two weeks at number two on the magazine's Easy Listening chart over the course of the 22 weeks that it was there. and three weeks at number one on RPM's list of Canada's top 100 hit songs. A second single, "Peaceful", was released on January 29, 1973, and started a run of 17 weeks on the pop chart in the February 3 issue that eventually took the song to number 12. Its debut on the Easy Listening chart came two weeks later, in the February 17 issue, and, as with the title song, it also enjoyed two weeks at number two there. In RPM it also reached number 12 pop. ==Reception== Billboard's reviewer wrote that "the powerful stylist offers by far her finest package, artistically and commercially." Charles Donovan of AllMusic retrospectively noted that, except for the cover of 'Hit the Road Jack', the album was "a fine collection of light pop and ballads" and that the second single was "everything easy listening should be: undemanding, sweet and flawlessly produced." ===Grammy Award=== In Thomas O'Neil's book The Grammys: The Ultimate, Unofficial Guide to Music's Highest Honor, O'Neil writes, "The most famous acceptance speech in the history of the Grammys was given [in 1973] by Helen Reddy when she picked up the trophy for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female for 'I Am Woman'.". Reddy concluded her speech by thanking "'God because She makes everything possible,'" and "was flooded with protest letters from religious fundamentalists" afterwards. ==Track listing== Side one # "Peaceful" (Kenny Rankin) – 2:50 # "I Am Woman" (Ray Burton, Helen Reddy) – 3:24 # "This Masquerade" (Leon Russell) – 3:35 # "I Didn't Mean to Love You" (Artie Butler, Karen Philipp) – 4:00 # "Where Is My Friend" (Daniel Meehan, Bobby Scott) – 3:10 Side two # "And I Love You So" (Don McLean) – 4:00 # "What Would They Say" (Paul Williams) – 2:45 # "Where Is the Love" (Ralph MacDonald, William Salter) – 3:01 # "Hit the Road Jack" (Percy Mayfield) – 2:18 # "The Last Blues Song" (Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil) – 2:41 ==Recording dates== From the liner notes for the 2020 CD I Am Woman/Long Hard Climb: * April 23, 1972 – "I Am Woman" * September 20, 1972 – "This Masquerade", "Where Is My Friend", "And I Love You So", "Where Is the Love" * October 9, 1972 – "Peaceful", "I Didn't Mean to Love You", "What Would They Say" * October 10, 1972 – "Hit the Road, Jack", "The Last Blues Song" ==Personnel== ===Musicians=== Personnel per the Melbourne Sunday Herald Sun and Capitol Records.

47126306	I Corvi	I Corvi (Italian for "The Crows") is an Italian beat group who were successful in the 1960s. The group was formed in Parma in 1965, to perform cover versions of popular American and British records. The original members were Angelo Ravasini (vocals, guitar), Fabrizio "Billo" Levati (guitar), Italo "Gimmi" Ferrari (bass), and Claudio Benassi (drums). In early 1966, they took part in the first Rapallo Davoli national singing competition, finishing second. They were signed by Ariston Records, whose director, Alfredo Rossi, encouraged them to use a stage costume of black capes, and to always appear with a stuffed raven, either attached to the bass guitar or, in publicity photos, on the shoulder of one of the band members; the band duly christened the raven "Alfredo".Cesare Rizzi (ed.), Enciclopedia del Rock italiano, Milan, Arcana Editrice, 1993, pp.58-59 Their first record, "Un Ragazzo di Strada" ("A Street Kid"), was a rewriting of The Brogues' "I Ain't No Miracle Worker", written by Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz and with new Italian lyrics by Nicola Salerno and Franco Califano. The song was entered in the 1966 Cantagiro musical contest, becoming a popular success and the group's biggest hit."I Corvi", L'Isola Felice. Retrieved 1 July 2015 The group followed up with a version of "Bang, Bang" (written by Sonny Bono and originally recorded by Cher), and their first album, Un Ragazzo di Strada, which included versions of two Donovan songs. Later successful singles included "Sospesa ad un Filo" ("Hanging by a thread", a rewrite of The Electric Prunes' "I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)", also written by Tucker and Mantz), "Bambolina" (a version of "Any Day Now", co-written by Burt Bacharach), and "Datemi un biglietto d'aereo" (a version of The Box Tops' hit "The Letter", written by Wayne Carson). Levati and Ferrari left the group in 1969 and were replaced by guitarist Antonello Gabelli, keyboard player Massimo Vessella, and bassist Ennio Tricomi, but shortly afterwards, the group disbanded. Ravasini formed a new group, Angelo ei Corvissimi, while Benassi and Tricomi formed another group, I Nuovi Corvi ("The New Crows"), with Pino Corvino (guitar) and Giancarlo Lazzini (keyboards). They continued to perform until 1972. In 1983, I Corvi re-formed with a line-up of Ravasini, Ferrari, Tricomi, and Gabelli, and in 1989 recorded the album Hanno preso la Bastiglia! ("They took the Bastille!") in a hard rock style. Gianluca Antolini later replaced Ferrari on bass, but the band continued to perform, with some further changes of personnel, until the late 1990s. Around 2000, Ravasini reconstituted the band with his sons Stefano and Luigi Ravasini, and other musicians. After leaving the band, Fabrizio "Billo" Levati became a club and radio DJ; I Corvi, Discogs.com. Retrieved 1 July 2015. he died in 2000, aged 53. Gimmi Ferrari died in 2006, and Angelo Ravasini in 2013. In 2014 the band was reformed by the original drummer Claudio Benassi. The renewed group started live promotion touring Italy. In 2017 a new album of rearranged songs was released. In 2020 a new song, the first original since 1989, "L'ultimo dei Corvi", was released. In 2021 Benassi wrote the official biography of the band. ==References== Category:Italian rock music groups Category:1965 establishments in Italy Category:Musical groups established in 1965
47140448	I Can't Get You Off of My Mind	"I Can't Get You Off of My Mind" is a song written and recorded by Hank Williams. It appeared as the B-side to his 1948 single "A Mansion on the Hill". ==Background== It was recorded on November 6, 1947 at Castle Studio in Nashville. Williams was supported by a group that producer Fred Rose assembled from two Grand Ole Opry bands: Zeke Turner (lead guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), and Louis Ennis (rhythm guitar) were from Red Foley's band while Chubby Wise (fiddle) was a member of Bill Monroe's band. The song is an up- tempo number in which the narrator describes his infatuation with an unfaithful woman. Bob Dylan recorded the song for the 2001 album Timeless: Hank Williams Tribute. In his autobiography Chronicles: Volume One Dylan wrote, "The sound of his voice went through me like an electric rod and I managed to get a hold of a few of his 78s - "Baby, We're Really in Love" and "Honky Tonkin'" and "Lost Highway" - and I played them endlessly...You can learn a lot about the structure of songwriting by listening to his records, and I listened to them a lot and had them internalized." The The also recorded it for their Williams tribute LP Hanky Panky. ==References== Category:1947 songs Category:Songs written by Hank Williams Category:Hank Williams songs Category:Song recordings produced by Fred Rose (songwriter) Category:MGM Records singles

47162518	I Could Never Be Ashamed of You	"I Could Never Be Ashamed of You" is a song written and recorded by Hank Williams. It was released as the B-side of "I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive" on MGM Records in November 1952. ==Background== "I Could Never Be Ashamed of You" is widely regarded as a song Hank Williams wrote for Billie Jean Jones Eshlimar, whom he married on October 18, 1952 in Minden, Louisiana. In the episode of American Masters about Hank's like, singer Billy Walker explained, "Billie Jean was Faron Young's girlfriend. Faron had just moved to Nashville. Billie Jean and Faron was out clubbin' around and Hank Williams joined them. And they went to the lavatory and Hank pulled out a gun on Faron and said, "Boy, this is gonna be my girlfriend from now on." In the same film, Ray Price, who shared an apartment with Williams, recalls Hank using Billie Jean as leverage to try and win back his ex-wife Audrey Williams: "He told Audrey, 'If you don't come back to me I'm gonna marry Billie Jean.' Well, Audrey said, 'Go ahead.'" Williams cut the song at his last recording session in Nashville at Castle Studio with Fred Rose producing. By this point, the singer had been fired from the Grand Ole Opry for drunkenness and had returned to Shreveport to play the Louisiana Hayride. Although he was in terminal decline, the quality of the songs Williams recorded at his final session was astonishing: "I Could Never Be Ashamed of You," "Take These Chains From My Heart," "Kaw-Liga," and "Your Cheatin' Heart." As biographer Colin Escott marvels, "Most singers hope to hang their careers on one or two classics; Hank cut four classics between 1:30 and 3:40 on the afternoon of September 23, 1952..." Williams was backed by Tommy Jackson (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), Chet Atkins (lead guitar), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), and Floyd "Lightnin'" Chance (bass). A demo version of Williams singing the song with just his guitar, likely recorded in 1951, is also available. ==Cover versions== *George Hamilton IV recorded the song on ABC Records in 1958. *Jerry Lee Lewis recorded the song for Sun Records in 1957. *Johnny Cash cut the song for Sun records on May 15, 1958. *Ferlin Husky covered the song in 1961 for Capitol Records. *The song appears on George Jones' 1962 LP My Favorites of Hank Williams. *Ernest Tubb recorded the song for Decca in 1968. *Glen Campbell cut the song in 1973. *Charlie Pride recorded it for his 1980 album There's a Little Bit of Hank in Me on RCA. *Moe Bandy released a version in 1983. *Hank Williams 3 covered the song on special edition of Straight to Hell ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:1952 songs Category:Songs written by Hank Williams Category:Hank Williams songs Category:Song recordings produced by Fred Rose (songwriter)
47177047	I Can't Escape from You (Hank Williams song)	"I Can't Escape from You" is a song written by Hank Williams. The song was originally recorded as a demo by Williams probably in 1951 but he never recorded it in a studio with a band. MGM released an overdubbed version in 1953 with backing from the Drifting Cowboys. The song contains the bitter testimony of a man haunted by the memory of a woman who has "a heart of stone." Like many of the demos that feature just Williams and his guitar, the original performance is artlessly affecting and displays his spare, haunting lyrics: ::A jug of wine to numb my mind ::But what good does it do? ::The jug runs dry and still I cry ::I can't escape from you ::These wasted tears are souvenirs ::Of a love I thought was true ::Your memory is chained to me ::I can't escape from you ==Cover versions== * Ray Price recorded the song for Columbia on July 8, 1952 * Jack Scott cut a version of the song. * George Jones recorded a version of the song. * The The also recorded it for their Williams tribute LP Hanky Panky. ==Discography== ==References== Category:Hank Williams songs Category:1951 songs Category:Songs written by Hank Williams
47183084	I Am Princess X	I Am Princess X is a 2015 book by Cherie Priest. It first published on May 26, 2015 through Arthur A. Levine Books and its story is told through a hybrid of traditional novel and graphic novel formats. The work is not related to the 1916 sculpture Princess X by Constantin Brâncuși. ==Synopsis== May is a sad and lonely teenager who lives in Atlanta with her mother but spends summers in Seattle with her father. Years ago, before her parents divorced, when they all lived in Seattle, she and her best friend Libby worked together to create the fictional character named Princess X, a warrior-princess who went through whatever adventures the two of them could dream up. This all came to an end when Libby died in a car accident on the Ballard Bridge. Now in present day, May begins seeing stickers and other memorabilia that showcase Princess X during the summer before her 17th birthday. She's directed to a website containing stories of Princess X's exploits, all of which are similar to the stories May wrote years earlier. This leads May to believe that Libby is still alive. She decides to follow a series of subtle clues left by the webcomic with the help of Patrick Hobbs, however as she progresses, she discovers that she is not the only person looking for Libby. May discovers that Libby is indeed alive and that she was actually kidnapped by a man named Ken Mullins who wanted Libby's parents to allow her to be used as part of a medical procedure to save his own daughter, Christine Louise Mullins. They refuse due to the risk of Libby's own health and well-being, only for the man to murder Libby's parents and steal Libby away to raise in the place of his own daughter, who died soon after he was turned away. Libby managed to escape but had to remain continually on the run, as the man kept searching for her and lied to authorities, saying that she was his mentally unhinged daughter. The book ends with May and Libby reuniting, Ken in jail, and Libby adding a new character to help Princess X. ==Reception== Critical reception for I Am Princess X has been positive. MuggleNet praised the book and wrote "The plot’s no Gordian knot, but Priest’s readable style, and the incorporation of a Princess X webcomic into the text itself, keeps you from getting bored with this story. I Am Princess X is pure fun and a much-needed addition to the canon of YA literature for girls who like Reddit and superheroes." Geeks of Doom also wrote a favorable review, commenting that the book's only flaw was that "while it is a perfect read for the female 12 and up set, younger boys might not be interested solely because of the title. But that might be on purpose – the desired readership could be tween and teen girls." ==References== ==External links== * Category:2015 American novels Category:2015 graphic novels Category:American young adult novels Category:Novels by Cherie Priest Category:Arthur A.

47248199	I Am Jazz	I Am Jazz is a reality television series on TLC about Jazz Jennings, an American transgender woman. The series features Jazz and her family "dealing with typical teen drama through the lens of a transgender youth." I Am Jazz premiered on July 15, 2015. ==Synopsis== Jazz Jennings, a South Florida teen, was assigned male at birth. Aged 4, Jennings was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in childhood, making her one of the youngest publicly documented people to be identified as gender dysphoric. Her parents, Greg and Jeanette, decided to support her female gender identity by her fifth birthday. Jazz has been in the spotlight since 2007, when at age 6, she was interviewed by Barbara Walters to discuss her gender identity. She participated in follow-up interviews, launched a foundation, and co-wrote a book, also called I Am Jazz. She has also posted videos about her life on YouTube. I Am Jazz focuses on the day-to-day lives of the "Jennings" family (the surname "Jennings" is a pseudonym, and any reference to the family's exact location is obscured). Jazz, who was about to enter high school when the series started in 2015, grapples with the usual teen angst in addition to her own challenges as a transgender girl. Her family, which includes her three siblings, parents and grandparents, also talk about their experiences. ==Episodes== ===Series overview=== ===Season 1 (2015)=== ===Season 2 (2016)=== ===Season 3 (2017)=== ===Season 4 (2018)=== ===Season 5 (2019)=== ===Season 6 (2020)=== ===Season 7 (2021–2022)=== ===Season 8 (2023)=== ==Production== The 11-part series involved filming five days a week, including both days on the weekend. The series was initially called All That Jazz, but was retitled to I Am Jazz. The show takes its title from a 2011 documentary, I Am Jazz: A Family in Transition, that aired on the Oprah Winfrey Network. The one-hour series premiere of I Am Jazz first aired at the same time Caitlyn Jenner was giving her acceptance speech for the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2015 ESPY Awards on ABC. On March 28, 2019, TLC renewed the series for a sixth season, which premiered on January 28, 2020. In June 2021, TLC renewed the series for a seventh season, with filming commencing the same month. ==Broadcast== Internationally, the series premiered in Australia on TLC on December 10, 2015. ==Reception== Critic Brian Lowry of Variety praised I Am Jazz, calling it a "sensitively constructed series (in an admirable departure for the attention-seeking network)... Simply told and heartfelt, the show should add a welcome dimension to the education process, capturing the challenges associated with sexual identity at such a vulnerable age." James Poniewozik, in his review for Time magazine, stated that the reality show airing on the same network that recently pulled 19 Kids and Counting off the air feels like a "change of an era." Poniewozik writes, "I Am Jazz is an engaging story of a teen girl who has transitioned. But it is also the story of everyone else, transitioning." Marc Silver of The Washington Post wrote about the boom of transgender-theme shows on TV, including Jenner's upcoming reality show, I Am Cait: "I Am Cait will surely attract more viewers because of Jenner's fame. It's too soon to say how Jazz will fare. But, with her humor and honesty, she's a tough act for Caitlyn Jenner to follow." ===Awards=== The show tied for best Outstanding Reality Program at the 27th annual GLAAD Media Awards.2016 GLAAD Media Awards: Demi Lovato & Caitlyn Jenner Among Recipients | Billboard Reality TV Award for Best Docu-series 2020. == See also == * Becoming Us * I Am Cait * Media portrayals of transgender people ==References== == External links == * * Category:2015 American television series debuts Category:2010s American LGBT-related television series Category:2010s American reality television series Category:2020s American LGBT-related television series Category:2020s American reality television series Category:English-language television shows Category:LGBT culture in Miami Category:LGBT in Florida Category:LGBT youth Category:Television shows set in Florida Category:TLC (TV network) original programming Category:Transgender in the United States Category:Transgender-related television shows Category:American LGBT-related reality television series Category:2010s LGBT-related reality television series Category:Television series about families Category:Television series about teenagers Category:2020s LGBT-related reality television series
47264549	I Cannot Stop You	"I Cannot Stop You" is the second single by the American garage rock band, The Cherry Slush, written by Dick Wagner, and released in January 1968 initially on Coconut Groove Records. The song is arguably the group's most known recording, distinguished by the composition's use of the Hammond B3 organ and a horn instrumental played by the session musician, Don Sheets. Recording began at Audio Recorders Studio, in Cleveland, when the band was still working as the Bells of Rhymny. For the track, Gene Bruce swapped lead guitar with the keyboard player Mark Burdick. The B-side, "Don't Walk Away", the earliest composition by The Cherry Slush, was previously recorded at Schiell Studios, and reworked at the same location, but with Wagner producing. The bass guitarist Art Hauffe recalled, "Wagner suggested that 'Don’t Walk Away' needed a bridge, so Parsons and Burdick went outside and came back with something that sounded like Roy Orbison." After altering the lyrical content, the song was completed relatively quickly, in about one hour. "I Cannot Stop You" was originally released on the Flint-based recording label, Coconut Groove, under the band's new name, The Cherry Slush. Coconut Groove sold the group's recording contract to the national distributor, USA Records. The single has the rare quality of being one of the few garage rock tracks to chart on all three major charts; it bubbled under the Billboard charts at number 119, peaked at number 35 on Cashbox, and reached number 93 on Record World. In total, the single sold approximately 75,000 copies; however, USA Records went bankrupt, consequently preventing the release from obtaining any more success. "I Cannot Stop You" was later released on the 2001 compilation album, Looking Back, which comprised all of the group's released recordings, and it has appeared on other garage rock albums as well. ==References== Category:1968 songs Category:Songs written by Dick Wagner
47328243	I Can't Get There from Here	"I Can't Get There from Here" is a song by American country singer George Jones. It was released as a single on the Musicor label in 1967. It was composed by Dallas Frazier. Although he didn't write it, "I Can't Get There from Here" is one in a long list of songs that Jones would record as if it was torn from the pages of his diary; as Randy Travis stated in the 1990 Jones video biography Same Ole Me, "It's almost like he's lived every minute of every word he sings, and there's very few people who can do that." Jones, who would be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his binge drinking in 1967, had already gained a reputation as a notorious hell raiser, imbuing Frazier's words with a weary authenticity: ::Surely there's a place to rest a tortured mind ::Oh, what I'd give if I could find ::A place where there's no mem'ry of all those wasted years ::But they all say I can't get there from here The song reached No. 5 on the Billboard country singles chart. ==Discography== Category:1966 songs Category:Songs written by Dallas Frazier Category:Song recordings produced by Pappy Daily Category:George Jones songs
47349488	I Am Invincible	"I Am Invincible" is a song written by Brett Boyett and Nash Overstreet, and recorded by the American singer-songwriter Cassadee Pope for her forthcoming second studio album. It was released to digital retailers through Republic Nashville on July 24, 2015 as the album's intended lead single and impacted American country radio on September 8, 2015. Ultimately the song did not appear on Pope’s second studio album. Pope debuted the empowerment anthem at the opening ceremonies of the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games on July 25, 2015. Upon its release, "I Am Invincible" received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Pope's vocal range as well as the song's blending of country elements and the rock styling of Pope's work with Hey Monday. The song also garnered significant fan attention, reaching number four on the Billboard Twitter Real-Time chart. ==Content== "I Am Invincible" is an anthemic ballad written by Brett Boyett and Nash Overstreet with a duration of three minutes and thirty-two seconds. The song begins with a spoken word dedication "For my girls, the fighters, the warriors," before transitioning into the first verse. Its lyrics convey a message of self-empowerment and surviving obstacles in one's life, with Pope affirming of the chorus that she is "invincible." Critics have noted the song's thematic similarity to recent pop anthems, including Katy Perry's "Roar" (2013) and Rachel Platten's "Fight Song" (2015). Pope related to the song's message on a personal level, but also felt the song reflected the struggles she and other female artists had been facing in finding success in country music. Musically, the song combines elements of pop, rock, and country. It is instrumented by banjo, mandolin, guitar, and keyboard. Pope's vocals lack the twang emulated on Frame by Frame (2013), but the song follows the storytelling approach and instrumentation of modern country music. With its "heavy rock guitar" and "powerful", country- influenced vocal arrangement, the song's style was described by Marissa R. Moss of Rolling Stone Country as "Paramore-meets-Carrie Underwood." Country music blog Taste of Country also likened Pope's delivery to that of American recording artist Kelly Clarkson. ==Music video== The music video was directed by Roman White and premiered in September 2015. ==Chart performance== Chart (2015–16) Peak position US Country Digital Songs (Billboard) 43 ==Release history== Country Date Format Label Canada July 24, 2015 Digital download Republic Nashville United States September 8, 2015 Country radio ==References== ==External links== Category:2015 songs Category:2015 singles Category:Cassadee Pope songs Category:Republic Nashville singles Category:Music videos directed by Roman White
4739890	I Can (Nas song)	"I Can" is a single by American rapper Nas from his sixth album, God's Son. It was released internationally February 11, 2003. Unlike the rest of the album, this does not have the Parental Advisory (or Explicit and other labeling on digital stores) label on the song, as it is aimed at children. The song peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Composition== Boasting production from Salaam Remi, the song samples Ludwig van Beethoven's "Für Elise" and the drum break from the Honey Drippers' "Impeach the President".SamplesDB - Nas's Tracks The lyrics are positive encouraging kids to stay drug-free and to pursue their dreams, pointing to examples of powerful icons in the African- American community like Oprah Winfrey. Conversely, Nas raps about a friend who was moving up in the music scene, only to fall victim to a debilitating drug addiction that took her career and her looks. ==Music video== The music video, directed by Chris Robinson, was shot in Los Angeles, and contains footage of Nas rapping while children stand around him. The video starts out with the music from the introduction of "Get Down," but it soon transitions into "I Can." As the video starts, a young girl plays Beethoven on a piano in a vacant lot. Later in the video, children are jumping on a mattress in the same lot. The video also contains footage of break dancing and famous Egyptian structures. ==Reception== The single received positive reviews. Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone magazine labels "I Can" as "a silly stay-in-school ad attached to a Beethoven sample."Hoard, Christian. Review: God's Son . Rolling Stone. Retrieved on 2012-02-14. This comment may be attributed to the "singsongy" call and response chorus featuring the voices of young children.Kim, Serena. "Review: God's Son". Vibe: 135–136. February 2003. Other reviewers appreciated "I Can" more: Jon Robinson of IGN.com claims that on his second single, "Nas delivers some of his most inspiring lyrics to date."

47484154	I Ain't No Miracle Worker	"I Ain't No Miracle Worker" is a song by the American garage rock band, the Brogues, written by Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz, and released as the group's second and final single on Challenge Records, in November 1965 (see 1965 in music). The composition is now considered a classic of the musical genre of garage rock, and has reappeared on several compilation albums and has been covered by other musical artists. The Brogues' original rendition was musically influenced by their contemporaries on the R&B; circuit and the British Invasion. ==Background== ===The Brogues version=== The Brogues were hurried to record a follow-up single after the regional success of their debut, "Someday". Over the span of a few months, the group's rebellious image and dynamic stage show launched them into prominence on the West Coast. In mid-1965, the band, bolstered by their addition of ex-Ratz lead vocalist Gary Cole, entered Sunset Recorders in Los Angeles to record "I Ain't No Miracle Worker", which was penned by the songwriting duo of Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz, coupled with "Don't Shoot Me Down". The song's lyrics are about an individual who has no pretensions about himself and confesses in the subdued chorus "I ain't no miracle worker"/"I do the best that I can". The Brogues reworked Tucker's original instrumental arrangement with a jangling Byrds- inspired rhythm section and fuzz-toned guitar melody. The buzzing distorted sound was produced by lead guitarist Eddie Rodrigues's shredded speakers in his amplifier. In addition to the striking guitar motif, the song is also marked by Cole's soulful vocal, Rick Campbell's electronic organ interjections, and Bill Whittington's heavy bass line. "I Ain't No Miracle Worker" was released in November 1965 on the independent record label, Challenge. Upon release however, the single failed to breakout nationally as a consequence of the record company's advertising focus being directed toward The Knickerbockers' hit, "Lies". Additionally, the Brogues could not promote the single as they disbanded after two of their members were conscripted into the armed forces. Since its initial distribution, "I Ain't No Miracle Worker" is immortalized on the 1998 compact disc reissue of the compilation album Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965–1968 and later Trash Box. The B-side, "Don't Shoot Me Down" is featured on Pebbles, Volume 10. ===Other versions=== The Chocolate Watchband recorded their own version of "I Ain't No Miracle Worker" in 1968 for their second album The Inner Mystique. The group's rendition is swayed more toward psychedelia with its sitar-like guitar instrumentals played cohesively with its conventional rock arrangement. The song reaches a climax with lead vocalist David Aguilar's half-shouted chorus. In 2015, the Chocolate Watchband re-recorded the tune for the album I'm Not Like Everybody Else, along with their other better-known tracks. Other versions of "I Ain't No Miracle Worker" were also released by the Italian beat group I Corvi, which became their biggest hit, Jimmy and the Offbeats, Gene Pierson, The Barracudas, and Scott Miller & the Commonwealth (under the name "Miracle Man") on 2001's Thus Always to Tyrants. ==References== Category:1965 songs Category:Songs written by Annette Tucker

47636782	I Am Born to Preach the Gospel	"I Am Born to Preach the Gospel" is a gospel song recorded in 1928 by Washington Phillips (18801954; vocals and zither) in gospel blues style. His recording is included in the soundtrack of the 2009 movie My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?. In some other recordings, the song is titled "I Was Born to Sing the Gospel". The words "I Am" or "I Was" are sometimes omitted from those titles. The song is likely to have been written by Phillips: it is concerned with a similar subject to his 1927 song "Denomination Blues", and has lyrical resemblances to it, including the striking phrase "educated fool". The singer compares his own experience: with that of educated preachers; and with that of Nicodemus, who according to the John 3:1-21 was a ruler of the Jews who visited Jesus by night to learn from Him. == Recordings and performances == * 1928Washington Phillips, 78prm single Columbia 14448-D * 1988Marion Williams, "Born to Sing the Gospel" on the album Born to Sing the Gospel * 1994Aretha Franklin, "I Was Born to Sing the Gospel" broadcast performance from the White House * 1995Michael Hakanson-Stacy, "Born to Preach the Gospel" on the album Pearls & Stones * 2013Michael Roe, digital download == References == Category:Blues songs Category:Gospel songs Category:Washington Phillips songs Category:1928 songs Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Nicodemus

47747509	I Am... (Nas album)	I Am... is the third studio album by American rapper Nas, released on April 6, 1999, by Columbia Records. Following the commercial and critical success of 1996's It Was Written, Nas put to work on a double album that merged the styles of his first two albums and detailed entire aspects of his life. Although he was able to use most songs, other songs that would have made I Am… a double album leaked onto the internet in MP3 format, forcing him to record new material for two separate single-disc releases (hence, the release of Nastradamus in the same year). The album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, selling over 470,000 copies in its first week of sales. I Am… would later be certified double platinum in the United States, making it Nas' second best- selling release behind It Was Written. Upon its release, I Am... received generally positive reviews from critics. ==Background== This album was originally to have been a double album titled I Am...The Autobiography. However, most of the original sessions were bootlegged forcing Nas to discard many songs and adjust the release to one disc. I Am...became one of the first major label releases to be widely leaked using MP3 technology.iTunes Store: I Am.... Apple Inc. Retrieved on 2009-02-18. Some of the leaked songs were later released on the compilation LP The Lost Tapes in 2002. The concept of this album as can be seen by tracks such as "Fetus" from The Lost Tapes was to be an autobiography of sorts for Nas. Although several bootleg versions have appeared on the internet over the years, an official version of the intended double album has never leaked and it remains unclear whether or not it was ever completed. ===1998 leak tracklisting=== * 01. Fetus (Belly Button Window) (later on The Lost Tapes) * 02. Small World (later on I Am...) * 03. Money Is My Bitch (later on I Am...) * 04. Project Windows (later on Nastradamus) * 05. Poppa Was a Player (later on The Lost Tapes) * 06. Dr. Knockboots (Do's and Don't) (later on I Am...) * 07. Day Dreamin' Stay Schemin' * 08. Sometimes I Wonder * 09. The Hardest Thing to Do Is Stay Alive * 10. Drunk by Myself (later on The Lost Tapes) * 11. Wanna Play (later on Dame Grease's "Live on Lenox" The Album) * 12. Blaze a 50 (later on The Lost Tapes) * 13. We Will Survive (later on I Am...) Other leaked songs include Find Ya Wealth (later on QB's Finest), U Gotta Love It (later on The Lost Tapes), My Worst Enemy, Amongst Kings and The Rise & Fall. ==Music== The two singles from I Am... were "Hate Me Now" and "Nas Is Like". "Hate Me Now" features Puff Daddy and is produced by D-Moet, Pretty Boy and The Trackmasters. It was a Billboard Hot 100 hit, and had a controversial music video directed by Hype Williams. The song had a version of the O Fortuna from Carl Orff's "Carmina Burana." "Nas Is Like" is one of two tracks produced by DJ Premier who scratches vocal samples from Nas' "It Ain't Hard To Tell" into the chorus. The "Nas Is Like" music video was directed by Nick Quested and is still very popular in underground circles and continued a long list of popular Nas/DJ Premier collaborations. The album also contained the song "We Will Survive", a tribute to Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. The song criticized his peers, most notably Jay-Z, who "claimed to be New York's king" following B.I.G.'s death, the record has been cited as potentially encouraging the Nas vs. Jay-Z feud. ==Cover art== Famed photographer Danny Hastings has shot iconic cover images for Big Pun’s Capital Punishment and Raekwon’s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, but his album art shoot for I Am... almost ended in disaster. In order to make the iconic mask featured on the cover, Hastings and his crew put a clay mold on his face and poked air holes so he could breathe, but he almost suffocated after clay got lodged in his nose. “The funny part was that the first attempt, Nas was getting asphyxiated. We almost killed Nas," Hastings told MTV.com. “We cleaned him up, and he was like, 'Let's do it again!' […] Nas was a true sport." He also explained the meaning behind the cover, and how it built off of previous album art for Illmatic and It Was Written. "The first one, you have him being a boy, very young. The second was a little bit older. And the third one, he was a king," he continued. "He already conquered the world. He was on top of the world. He was doing a lot of big things. We came with the concept of making a King Tut sarcophagus piece." ==Reception== Yahoo! Music's Billy Johnson Jr. described the album's production as "somber" and described its songs as "thought-provoking, though average quality". Jeff Stark of Salon noted "distinct identities" for each song and wrote that it does not sound "coherent", but "as if it belongs to a scattershot demographic of subway riders". Franklin Soults of The Village Voice viewed that its music attempts to meet "halfway" with consumer demographics, noting that Nas' "most salient talent is finding and exploiting the middle ground". In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau gave I Am... a B− rating and named it "dud of the month", indicating "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought". Christgau criticized Nas' "ethos" and stated, "The question is how convincing he is, and only two themes ring true: the bad ones, revenge and money. His idea of narrative detail is to drop brand names like Bret Easton Ellis; his idea of morality is everybody dies". Craig Seymour of The Washington Post attributed its thematic inconsistency to the replacement of tracks that leaked to the Internet prior to the album's release, concluding that "Anyone with a good Web connection might wonder what a profound personal opus I Am could have been". Miles Marshall Lewis of LA Weekly viewed that Nas "tightrope[s] the line between order and chaos, gangsterism and enlightenment" on the album, which he found to be "not a horrendous album. But Nas has now established a pattern of declining album quality, and that makes I Am... Nas' worst album". Chicago Sun-Times writer Rebecca Little gave the album two-a- and-half out of four stars and stated, "if you get past the torrent of [profanity] and a few terms referring to women as dogs and garden tools, [...] I Am is a notable effort", adding that "The finer moments lie in the rapper's trademark ability to spin a compelling tale about ghetto life". Kris Ex of Rolling Stone gave it three-and-a-half out of five stars and stated, "Nas is still a diamond in the rough — perhaps the rawest lyrical talent of his day but lacking the guidance and vision to create a complete album [...] But what I Am... lacks in content, it makes up for in lyrical acumen; the album doesn't deliver the introspection its title implies, but it compensates for it in storytelling and craftsmanship. I Am... offers tantalizing hints of promise tethered by a need for pop acceptance". Christopher John Farley of Time complimented Nas' lyrics and themes and the album's musical approach, noting "grander, more aggressive, more cinematic" songs. Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair compared the album to "a bona fide hip-hopera", noting string and keyboard-laden songs and "universal themes". Los Angeles Times writer Soren Baker commended Nas for "adroitly balancing hard-core subject matter with production that should easily find its way onto urban radio". Steve Jones of USA Today gave it four out of four stars and complimented Nas' "dense and deft rhymes" and "nimble, cinematic descriptions", writing that the album "nestles nicely between the underground grittiness of 1994's Illmatic and the high gloss of 1996's It Was Written". In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor M.F. DiBella gave the album three out of five stars and noted "blandness" in its production, writing that "Musically, I Am is somewhat unimaginative by Nas' stratospheric standards. [...] some of these tracks lack the sonic depth to do justice to the prophecies of the pharaoh, Nas". However, DeBella added that Nas "still shines as the old soul storyteller and crime rhyme chronicler" on some tracks and cited "Nas Is Like" and "N.Y. State of Mind, Pt. 2" as highlights, adding that they "are nothing short of Illmatic perfection". Steve Juon of RapReviews gave I Am... an eight-and-a-half out of 10 rating and viewed it as an improvement over It Was Written, praising Nas' "power of description" and "much improved" lyrics. Writing in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), music journalist Chris Ryan gave the album two-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that it has "[its] share of solid material, but ultimately fail[s] in the face of Nas' inability to navigate the divide between the street reporting that made him a legend and the commercial hits that made him a star". ==Track listing== Notes * On the cassette version, "Pray" featuring Bravehearts is included as track 13, produced by EZ Elpee. ===Samples=== "Album Intro" *"Amityville Horror Main Title" by Lalo Schifrin *"Live at the Barbeque" by Main Source "N.Y.

47784068	I Am Tour (Leona Lewis)	The I Am Tour was the third headlining concert tour by English singer Leona Lewis. It was launched in support of her fifth studio album, I Am (2015). The tour was announced on 11 September 2015 with a run of fourteen dates across Great Britain. It began on 21 February 2016 at the Liverpool Empire Theatre and concluded on 11 March 2016 at the Plymouth Pavilions. The leg also included two nights at the London Palladium. The English singer-songwriter Philippa Hanna served as the support act, and the English singer-songwriter Joss Stone joined Lewis on stage as a special guest for the final show of the tour to perform a cover of "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" by Eurythmics and Aretha Franklin. Lewis performed a nineteen-song set list with a four- piece band and two backup vocalists. Her vocals, stage presence and interaction with the crowds was lauded by the critics in attendance. Many singled out her performance of "Ave Maria" as the set's highlight, while others also praised renditions of "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", "A Moment Like This" and "Run". Several noted that nearly a third of the set list consisted of both official covers recorded by Lewis previously included on her albums, as well as cover songs intended just for the tour. Some were complimentary of the unofficial covers, most notably Lewis' version of "Time After Time" by Cyndi Lauper, whereas others felt that there were too many and that they were too forgettable. ==Background== To promote her fifth studio album, I Am (2015), on 11 September 2015 Leona Lewis announced her third headlining concert tour, titled the I Am Tour, was to take place in February and March 2016. It was her first concert tour since the Glassheart Tour in 2013. Spanning fourteen shows visiting various concert halls and theatres in England, Scotland and Wales, the tour began at the Liverpool Empire Theatre on 21 February and concluded at the Plymouth Pavilions on 11 March; it also included two dates at the London Palladium. Lewis announced the tour on 11 September 2015 and tickets went on sale a week later on 18 September. Speaking about touring again, Lewis said that she was "So so excited to announce a 2016 UK Tour! I cannot wait to get out and perform all the new songs for you and some old favourites too!" In an interview for What's On magazine in December 2015, Lewis revealed that she had originally planned for the tour to be longer, but decided to shorten it in order to spend time with family and friends and start writing songs for her sixth studio album sooner. ==Critical reception== Katie Fitzpatrick of the Manchester Evening News reported that fans in attendance at the Manchester Bridgewater Hall show were impressed with Lewis' performance, writing that many took to social media following the concert to describe her as "the best singer in the world". Reporting on the show at The Sage Gateshead, the Chronicle Live critic Gordon Barr praised Lewis' confidence and her band. He noted that the production was relatively simple compared to the big-budget production values of her first concert tour in 2010, The Labyrinth. With the tour featuring just two background vocalists and a four-piece band, Barr wrote that it was "so refreshing to see an artist on stage just loving the music". He singled out performances of "Ave Maria", "Run", and a cover of "Time After Time" by Cyndi Lauper as the show's highlights. Barr described the performance of "Time After Time" as "stripped back to the core" which enabled the crowd to "really [hear] that incredible voice at its best". Allan Jones of the Bournemouth Echo was also complimentary of Lewis' performance during the show at the Bournemouth International Centre. Although he disapproved of the performance of "Ave Maria" (but noted that it garnered a standing ovation from the crowd), he thought that standout performances included "Run", "Bleeding Love", and Lewis' cover of "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" by Roberta Flack. He concluded his review by writing that Lewis has "that really big soul/pop voice that should see her continuing to pack venues for the next ten years". Adrian Caffery of the Birmingham Mail gave a mixed review of the show at the city's Symphony Hall. While he was complimentary of Lewis' vocals performances on most of the original tracks, most notably on "Ave Maria", which he described as demonstrating "an amazing transformation to opera diva", he was critical of Lewis' decision to include seven cover songs on the set list. Although Caffery wrote that "Run", "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", "Ave Maria", and "A Moment Like This" – the last of which he described as "cheesy" – were to be expected, as Lewis had recorded them for previous albums. However, he disapproved of "Time After Time", labelling it "ok", and called the Sam Smith covers "instantly forgettable". He concluded by writing: "There was enough evidence to suggest Leona is capable of staging an utterly mesmerising show from start to finish – just not this time". A critic from The Bristol Post wrote that Lewis "dazzled" the audience who "[enjoyed] Leona's impressive vocals and stunning songs", placing emphasis on her rendition of "Time After Time". In a review of Lewis' performance at the London Palladium on 5 March, William J Connolly of Gay Times praised the singer's openness regarding her personal and private life throughout the show, which gave the audience an insight as to "why she's remained quiet in previous months and why, as we all love, each album is full of emotion and honesty". He singled out "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", "Bleeding Love", and "Thunder" as the show's highlights, and described "Run" as "perfect". Emma Noye of the Ipswich Star wrote that despite there being some Americanisms in the show, such as "horse- riding, beach-walking backing visuals with a voiceover talking about the 'journey' she's been on", Lewis' voice was "indisputably fantastic". Noye went on to write that the singer "made everyone feel included and engaged" and praised her performance of "Ave Maria" as "stunning". In her review of the concert at the Plymouth Pavilions, Caroline Abbott of the Torquay Herald Express praised Lewis for her interaction with the crowd and her "down-to- earth" persona, as well as her performances of "Ave Maria", "Thank You", and "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves", a duet with the special guest Joss Stone. Noting that a third of the set-list was made up of covers, she expressed dislike for Lewis' interpretation of "Time After Time". Abbott wrote that her "only real criticism" of the performance was for the stage production, which she described as "five strips of giant toilet paper hanging at the back, occasionally changing colour, and spaced a little too far apart to make for easy viewing of the video footage of Leona explaining why her music is so important to her". Abbott did, however, note that the backdrop did not detract from the "high quality music" or her "incredible, effortless voice". ==Set list== The following set list is representative of the show in Liverpool.

It was released as the third single from their second studio album Run (2015). ==Music video== The music video was released on June 29, 2015. ==Background== The band's frontman Aaron Bruno describes the song as a "self-empowering anthem" that was inspired by a guitar given to him by his dad. "I wrote (the song) real late at night," Bruno continued. "At least the intro, the first verse. Didn't think much about it, and then months later we listened to my phone recording, my voice memo, and heard that initial idea and thought, OK, this seems cool, let's work on this. It kind of wrote itself and was a pretty easy song to write. That's usually a good sign for me." The song was written in a key of E minor and has a tempo of 130 BPM. ==Remixes== ===Steve Aoki Remix=== American DJ and producer Steve Aoki released his remix of "I Am". It was uploaded to his SoundCloud account on June 23, 2015 and it was available for free at Red Bull Records' official website. ===Mike D Remix=== Another remix of the song by American hip hop band Beastie Boys member Mike D was released on November 12. “When I heard ‘I Am,’ it had the anthemic dynamics that we associate with Awolnation. I had a different version in my head of what the song could be, so was happy to be able to manifest that” he quoted. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2015) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2015) Position US Hot Rock Songs (Billboard) 56 US Rock Airplay (Billboard) 35 ==References== Category:Awolnation songs Category:2015 singles Category:Red Bull Records singles Category:Songs written by Aaron Bruno Category:Electronic rock songs

4791720	I Am God	"I Am God" is the eighteenth episode of the second season of the American mystery television series Veronica Mars, and the fortieth episode overall. Written by Diane Ruggiero and Cathy Belben and directed by Martha Mitchell, the episode premiered on UPN on April 11, 2006. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica experiences persistent and vivid nightmares of the students who died in the bus crash, and she attempts to piece together the clues she's gotten from these dreams. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) are forced to work together on a science experiment. During the filming of "I Am God", several press members, primarily bloggers, were allowed to visit the show's set, an event that was the first of its kind for Veronica Mars. Bloggers had been an important source of the show's fandom and press coverage, and the event was set up by UPN executives as a public relations project. The episode also features a guest appearance by Kayla Ewell and the first appearance by James Jordan. The episode received 1.76 million viewers in its original US airing, and it received mixed reviews from television critics, with reviewers divided on the use of dream sequences as well as the episode's emotional impact overall. == Synopsis == Veronica has a dream of the students who died in the bus crash. She is called into the office of the guidance counselor, Rebecca (Paula Marshall), who asks if Veronica is okay, and Veronica tells her about her nightmares. Veronica lists the bus crash victims; Cervando, Betina, Rhonda, Marcos, Peter, and Meg. She asks Rebecca about a janitor named Lucky (James Jordan), whom Meg used to write about a lot. Veronica continues to describe her dreams. She also tells Rebecca about Michelle, who turned out to have a second voicemail from the bus, this one containing Dick's voice. Veronica recounts an encounter with her father, in which she admitted sneaking on the bus, where she found a CD containing voicemails Dick left Betina. She also found graffiti on one of the bus seats containing the words "I am God" and drawings of nine coffins. Veronica talks to Logan about Lucky, the janitor, and Logan reminds Veronica she met Lucky before. Wallace and Logan are assigned to work on a science project together. Veronica talks to Dick about his relationship with Betina. Veronica talks to one of Betina's friends, who says that Dick mistreated her, and Betina's goal was for Dick to get her pregnant. Veronica asks Keith about whether or not he has resumed a relationship with Rebecca, and Veronica gets into Stanford University. Principal Clemmons informs Veronica that due to a recalculation Angie Dahl (Kayla Ewell) now has the highest GPA and is in the lead for the Kane Scholarship. . Rebecca denies having a relationship with Keith, while Angie also gets into Stanford, and Dick is told he'll have to attend summer school. Wallace points out Rhonda's sister, Natalie, to Veronica, but she blows Veronica off. Veronica asks Keith to dig into the financial records of the bus crash victims. While working on their project Wallace comes across the Echolls expose. Veronica learns that none of the families had very much money, except for Rhonda's family, who won a separate $2 million lawsuit from Woody (Steve Guttenberg). Keith meets with Principal Clemmons where he finds Veronica hiding in the closet. Veronica talks to Mr. Wu about one of his students, Peter, who had a crush on Mr. Wu. However, Mr. Wu denies being gay. That night, Veronica has a dream about Peter. When she brings up the "outing of all outings" Peter "asks" her why he would even want to go to a baseball stadium. Veronica learns Cervando got in trouble for pushing Beaver into a wall during summer school. Beaver tells Veronica Cervando had a problem with Dick, but took it out on him. Keith solves a case for Principal Clemmons regarding students who paid money to be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder in order to earn better grades. Angie wins the experiment competition, and it is shown that Angie was one of the students who was diagnosed with GAD for money. Principal Clemmons revokes exceptions for GAD students. Veronica has a dream about Cervando, who points out the perpetrator had to know when the bus was approaching the cliff. Veronica learns that the "I am God" image is actually an album cover. Keith tells Veronica that Dick Casablancas Sr had large life insurance policies on Dick and Beaver. Veronica has another, more frightening dream. == Production == "I Am God" was written by Diane Ruggiero and Cathy Belben and directed by Martha Mitchell, marking Ruggiero's eleventh writing credit for the series, Belben's third and final writing credit (after "Blast from the Past" and "Ahoy, Mateys!") and Mitchell's first and only directing credit for the show. Despite being credited, Duncan (Teddy Dunn), Weevil (Francis Capra), and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) do not appear in the episode. During the filming of "I Am God", UPN and Warner Bros. set up a "Veronica Mars Press Day", on which several members of the press visited the show's set and wrote about their visit. Bloggers had been important to press coverage of Veronica Mars; because of this, Joanna Massey, UPN's senior vice president for media relations, decided to set up this event as a public relations project. On organizing the event, Massey elaborated: Series creator Rob Thomas also appreciated bloggers' contributions to Veronica Mars, stating "Sometimes I think bloggers are our journalists. […] I feel like the bloggers made the show. In a way, a day like (the press day) is preaching to the choir, but I don't know that we'd exist without them." This was the first time that non-cast or crew members visited the set. After reaching Kearny Mesa, San Diego, where the show primarily films, the bloggers toured the set and talked with cast and crew members. One press member expressed that Ryan Hansen, Thomas, and Kristen Bell were especially kind and receptive to the visitors. On his role in the episode, Jason Dohring, who plays Logan, elaborated, "I think what's funny is that he always gets what's coming to him. Like a terrible thing happens to him, but he's like that to other people. So it's like in real life…what goes around comes around." The episode features a guest-starring appearance by Kayla Ewell, who would eventually become most known for her role on The Vampire Diaries. The episode also features a guest appearance by James Jordan, as Lucky, the janitor. In season 3, Jordan would become the first actor to have two different roles on Veronica Mars when he was cast as Tim Foyle, a teaching assistant. == Reception == === Ratings === In its original broadcast, "I Am God" was watched by 1.76 million viewers, ranking 111th of 116 in the weekly rankings. This marked a sharp decrease in 1.09 million viewers from the previous episode, "Plan B", which received 2.85 million viewers. === Reviews === The episode received mixed reviews. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club was very positive towards the episode, writing "'I Am God' is probably the strangest episode since 'Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner', but unlike that one's somewhat random focus, 'I Am God' is intently pointed at one thing: the bus crash." While wishing that it had come earlier in the season, the reviewer wrote that "its intense style and emotional stakes put it on the shortlist of best Veronica Mars episodes." Price Peterson of TV.com praised the dream sequences for their beauty, but criticized them for their complexity. "Man, I just could not get enough of the dream-flashbacks in which Veronica talked to the dead students. So beautiful and well-done. On the other hand, my poor brain is starting to have a hard time keeping all the facts straight." Others were more negative towards the episode. Television Without Pity gave the episode a "B", criticizing Paula Marshall's reappearance, declaring her a "show killer." BuzzFeed ranked the episode as the second-worst episode of Veronica Mars, writing that the dream sequences "[looked] like Bonnie Tyler videos and bad erotic movies from the '80s." Reviewer Alan Sepinwall gave a mixed review, praising Logan and Wallace's interactions and Kristen Bell's performance, but criticizing the fact that the episode came so late in the season. "Had this been the season's fourth or fifth episode, it would have been fine. As the fifth-to-last episode, it felt like exactly what it was: a belated correction for a season-long problem." He also felt that "Keith's subplot was missing a scene or two." == References == == External links == * *"I Am God" at Mars Investigations Category:2006 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 2) episodes

48094664	I (Taeyeon EP)	I is the debut extended play by South Korean singer Taeyeon, released on October 7, 2015, by SM Entertainment. The EP was recorded at SM Studios in Seoul, South Korea, and was produced by Lee Soo-man. ==Background and release== In mid-2015, SM Entertainment announced that Taeyeon would release her first solo album later that year. The album's title track, "I", features popular rapper Verbal Jint and includes lyrics written by Taeyeon. The album was released via digital music websites at midnight on October 7, the physical copies sold in the stores on same day. Due to her previous success recording ballads for Korean films and televisions, the public expected Taeyeon to promote the album with a ballad title track. The singer, however, chose a pop rock song and expressed that she wanted to "make [her] solo debut with good songs regardless of their genres." Discussing about her music styles for the album, Taeyeon noted that she purposely avoided "way over the top" songs, elaborating: > I tried not to be excessive. I tried to sing in more plain and light ways. I > have to sing from the beginning to the end all by myself, so I should feel > comfortable. So I didn't choose such reckless songs [flowery or high- > pitched], and tried to avoid challenging, something too new. == Music and lyrics == Lee Su-ho from South Korean online magazine IZM described I as a pop rock album with a balladic production. Meanwhile, Chester Chin from Malaysian newspaper The Star noted elements of soft rock on the EP, a genre that is contrary to Girls' Generation's common bubblegum pop and electronic sound. ==Reception== Upon its release, I received generally positive reviews from music critics. Lee Su-ho from South Korean online magazine IZM praised the EP's pop rock and balladic musical styles; they further hailed I for showcasing Taeyeon as a talented vocalist. Chester Chin from The Star labelled the album as "a collection of dynamic K-pop confections" with "refreshing" elements of soft rock as opposed to Girls' Generation's signature bubblegum and electronic sound. He further deemed it as "a reflection of Taeyeon’s strength as a vocalist." I was a commercial success in the singer's native country South Korea. It debuted at number two on the Gaon Album Chart for the week ending October 10, 2015. The following week, its position on the chart dropped one position to number three. The EP remained on the third position for a further week before dropping to number five on the chart issue dated October 25–31, 2015.

Something just feels off in Khaled's traditional manner of creating ubiquitous pop cultural touchstones. This album is generally solid, but in lacking the groundbreaking moment we’ve come to expect from the artist/producer/chicken wing restaurateur known for being “the best,” it falls short." ==Commercial performance== The album debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200, with 25,000 equivalent album units in the United States, with 19,000 copies sold in its first week. ==Track listing== ;Notes * signifies a co-producer. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2015) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2015) Position US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) 97 ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:DJ Khaled albums Category:Republic Records albums Category:Albums produced by Danja (record producer) Category:Albums produced by DJ Khaled Category:Albums produced by Scott Storch

48497793	I Am Jose	I Am Jose (foaled October 8, 2008) is a Tennessee Walking Horse stallion and three-time World Grand Champion. He is the first stallion and second horse to win the World Grand Championship three times. I Am Jose is black with a star on his forehead. ==Life and career== thumb|left|I Am Jose in the winner's circle, ridden by Casey Wright. I Am Jose was foaled on October 8, 2008 near Franklin, North Carolina. He is a black stallion with a star on his forehead, sired by Jose Jose and out of Pride's Angelique. He was bred by Robert Rollins and sold to Billy and Debbie Woods of Lexington, Tennessee on February 14, 2011. The Woods put him in training with Casey Wright of Reagan, Tennessee. In 2013, Wright entered I Am Jose in the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, where he won the four-year-old World Championship. Wright and the Woods made the decision to enter I Am Jose in the open World Grand Championship, which he won. I Am Jose won a second World Grand Championship in 2014, and a third just after midnight on September 6, 2015. I Am Jose is the first stallion to win three World Grand Championships and only the second horse ever to do so; the first was the gelding The Talk of the Town in 1951, 1952 and 1953. I Am Jose is the first repeat winner since Go Boy's Shadow in 1955 and 1956. His winning entry was his only show appearance in 2015, and his owners did not comment on whether it was the last of his career. Of note was that the Celebration has very strict inspection standards to prevent soring and I Am Jose passed. His trainer explained in 2014, "that's why we took him up there. We ain't got nothing to hide." Following the 2015 show season, the Walking Horse Trainers' Association named I Am Jose Horse of the Year in their stallions and over division. Between show seasons, he also stood at stud each fall after his championships and again between March and June, returning to show conditioning about a month prior to competition. It was this ability to switch focus from breeding to showing that was viewed as particularly impressive. ==Pedigree== Pedigree of I Am Jose Sire Jose Jose Gen's Major General Pride's Generator Pride of Midnight HF† HF Spirit's Nell Delights Lucky Charm Sun's Delight D Merry Boy's Charm Lady Stormy's Ruby Pride's Stormy Night Pride of Midnight HF† Merry Humoresque 76's Ruby GF's Pride of 76 Mack's Lovely Lady GF Dam Prides Angelique Pride's Generator Pride of Midnight HF† Midnight Sun Pride of Stanley HF Spirit's Nell Spirit of Midnight Nell's Last Lady Midnight Merry Meg Midnight Merry Maker Midnight Sun Merry Makers Sweet Sue Go Boy's Satin Sue Easter's Go Boy Maid of Money † denotes inbreeding. ==References== Category:Individual Tennessee Walking Horses Category:2008 animal births Category:World Grand Champion Tennessee Walking Horses

48752768	I Can't Give Everything Away	"I Can't Give Everything Away" is a song by English musician David Bowie. It is the seventh and final track on his twenty-sixth and final studio album, Blackstar (2016), and was released posthumously as the album's third and final single on 6 April 2016. The track was written by David Bowie and was produced by both him and Tony Visconti. Prior to issue as a posthumous single, "I Can't Give Everything Away" peaked at number 45 on the Swiss Hitparade chart; number 141 on the UK Singles Chart; and number 142 on the French Singles Chart. The song contains a similar harmonica part to that of "A New Career in a New Town", an instrumental from Bowie's 1977 album Low. ==Critical reception== "I Can't Give Everything Away" received positive reviews from critics. Sam Richards of NME called the song "a serene, lilting number", while Ben Skipper of the IB Times labelled it as a "beautiful and moving farewell". Neil McCormick of The Telegraph called the song an "epic closing track", commenting that "Bowie sounds like he is grappling with his own mystery: 'Seeing more and feeling less / Saying no but meaning yes / This is all I ever meant / That's the message that I sent.'" The American online magazine Pitchfork listed "I Can't Give Everything Away" at number 23 on their ranking of the 100 best songs to be released in 2016. ==Music video== On 6 April 2016 an animated lyric video was released, created by Jonathan Barnbrook, who also designed the album's artwork. He explained his motives behind the video as follows: “This is really a very simple little video that I wanted to be ultimately positive,” Barnbrook says. “We start off in the black and white world of Blackstar, but in the final chorus we move to brilliant colour, I saw it as a celebration of David, to say that despite the adversity we face, the difficult things that happen such as David’s passing, that human beings are naturally positive, they look forward and can take the good from the past and use it as something to help with the present. We are a naturally optimistic species and we celebrate the good that we are given.” "I Can't Give Everything Away" impacted radio worldwide and was playlisted at BBC Radio 2, BBC 6 Music, Absolute and Radio X in the UK. ==Farewell Mix== A reworked version of the song, known as "I Can't Give Everything Away (Farewell Mix)", was performed by industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, with whom Bowie had collaborated and toured on occasions, during their I Can't Seem To Wake Up tour. Singer Trent Reznor stated he made the remix as a healing factor to cope with Bowie's death. Reznor had anonymously uploaded a studio version of the remix to SoundCloud several months before performing it live. The studio version features only Bowie's vocals, while performing the song live Reznor sings along with Bowie's vocals. == Covers == American indie rock band Spoon released a cover of the song on Jan 8, 2023, on what would have been Bowie's 76th birthday. ==Charts== Chart (2016) Peak position Mexico Ingles Airplay (Billboard) 33 Sweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan) 12 UK Singles (Official Charts Company) 141 ==References== ==External links== * David Bowie official website Category:2016 singles Category:2016 songs Category:David Bowie songs Category:Songs released posthumously
48912878	I Believe, Help My Unbelief	I Believe, Help My Unbelief is the first studio album by Rival Choir, released on February 5, 2016 on Facedown Records. It was the band's second release with the label, with their first being Struggle Well, released in 2014 when they were still known as Mouth of the South. This is the band's third album, their first being Transparency, an independent release. ==Critical reception== David Stagg, allotting the album a four star review by HM Magazine, responds, "In leaving behind the singularity of one mouth, the band has learned they’re going to gain the ultimate prize: a choir of voices, a dedicated group of fans that listened to them." Indicating in a nine out of ten review from Cross Rhythms, Ian Webber states, "In Rival Choir, Facedown Records have a band that are delivering a fresh take on metalcore that will not be to everyone's taste with its lack of traditional elements, but one that provides much to chew over for those looking for loud music with a lyrically mature edge." Awarding the album four stars at Jesus Freak Hideout, Timothy Estabrooks writes, "I Believe, Help My Unbelief is a truly passionate album." Scott Fryberger, giving the album four stars from Jesus Freak Hideout, states, "it sets the bar rather high; not just for other bands, but for themselves as well." Rating the album four stars for Jesus Freak Hideout, Jeremy Barnes says, "On the whole, with continued development and maintained creative energy, Rival Choir may soon become a flagship in a revitalized genre." Reviewing the album for Anchor Music News, Rob Clark describes, "This is an album that will have you hooked from the first verse to last." Tim Dodderidge, putting a seven and a half star rating upon the album at Mind Equals Blown, says, "The music itself isn't exactly anything new for the genres of metalcore and melodic hardcore, but I Believe, Help My Unbelief, is a definite step-up from the outfit's previous effort under a different name." ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart (2016) Peak position ==References== Category:2016 debut albums Category:Facedown Records albums

4913923	I Am Dina	I Am Dina is a 2002 Norwegian-Swedish-Danish film directed by Ole Bornedal. It is based on the 1989 book Dinas bok (Dina's Book) by Herbjørg Wassmo. It was one of the most high-profile films in Norwegian movie history. == Plot == In Northern Norway during the 1860s, a little girl named Dina accidentally causes boiling lye to spill over her mother at the laundry, causing her mother's death. Overcome with grief, her father refuses to raise her, leaving her in the care of the household servants. Dina grows up wild and unmanageable, with her only friend being the stable boy, Tomas. She summons her mother's ghost and develops a strange fascination with death as well as a passion for living. Family friend Jacob (Gérard Depardieu) encourages Dina's father to hire a tutor, Lorch, who introduces her to the cello. When Jacob asks for Dina's hand in marriage, Dina refuses. Her outraged father slaps her, prompting Dina to attack him. Knowing that Lorch and Dina have grown close, her father retaliates by sending Lorch away, devastating Dina. Unable to come to terms with Lorch's departure, Dina nearly kills Lorch in a fit of insanity. When Dina (Maria Bonnevie) is old enough, she marries Jacob and moves to Reinsnes, a port he runs with his mother, Karen, and his stepsons Niels and Anders. Niels dislikes Dina's wild ways, and the fact that she has taken over accounting duties at Reinsnes. As Dina's eccentric tendencies become even stronger, Jacob suffers gangrene poisoning after breaking his leg when he falls off the roof of his mistress' house while trying to fix a leak. As Jacob does not appear to be getting better and worsens, Dina takes him on a sled to the top of a cliff and pushes him off to his death, hoping to end his suffering and send him to a better place. Jacob's death reunites her with Tomas and the two have a passionate affair. Several months later, she gives birth to a baby boy that she names Benjamin, presumably her offspring with Tomas. She then learns of Lorch's death when the latter bequeaths her his cello. Some years later, as a child, Benjamin accidentally sets fire to the barn. Dina falls in love with a courageous, handsome Russian named Zhukovsky (Christopher Eccleston) who rushes into the burning barn to save her beloved horses. It turns out Zhukovsky had seen Dina several years ago in Bergen and was smitten by her, and has come to Reinsnes to court her. However, he leaves suddenly and Dina forces herself on Tomas. Niels, drunk, rapes a servant named Stina. When Dina finds out, she issues an ultimatum to Niels: marry Stina or leave for America. Niels will not countenance marrying a servant, but cannot afford to leave for America, since Dina has confiscated his savings, giving a third of his money to Stina. Zhukovsky then returns to Reinsnes to take a prisoner back to Bergen. When a drunken and penniless Niels staggers into the house, Dina announces that he too will soon be leaving, to America. Niels then decides to ask a now well-to-do Stina to marry him, but she refuses. Overcome with despair, Niels hangs himself. Dina's father then announces to Dina that Zhukovsky is an anarchist involved in a plot against the King, and is to hang. A distraught Dina rushes to Bergen to try and exonerate Zhukovsky. But when she visits him in prison and her visiting time is up, Dina attacks the guards, who then brutalize her, causing her to lose her baby with Zhukovsky. On the way back to Reinsnes, she is saved by Anders, who stops her bleeding. Her appeal is successful, however, and Zhukovsky is released, though no one has seen him since. Several weeks later, Dina nearly drowns while teaching Benjamin how to sail but is miraculously saved by Zhukovsky who is on a nearby steamer. In her near-death state, she dreams that she kills Zhukovsky when he announces that he is leaving her again. Dina then comes to and asks if Zhukovsky is going to leave her again. Zhukovsky says he will always be leaving her, though he says he will always be coming back. == Themes == The main theme of the movie is death, and Dina's inability to let go of those she loves. Dina almost kills Loche when she finds out he is leaving her, kills her husband Jacob (as a mercy killing) when she thinks he is dying in pain, and kills Zhukovsky in a dream where he tells her he is leaving her. == Cast == == Production == === Casting === Though the movie is set in 1860s Norway, all the dialogue is in English, resulting in a variety of accents throughout the movie. There was some controversy surrounding the casting of the movie, as it was felt by many that Gørild Mauseth was the right choice for the part. In the end the casting of Maria Bonnevie was accepted. The movie took in far less in ticket sales than it had cost to produce. === Filming === The film is shot on location in Kjerringøy, in the present-day municipality of Bodø, in Nordland, Norway, and features spectacular fjord scenery. == References == == External links == * Category:2002 drama films Category:2002 films Category:Danish drama films Category:English-language Danish films Category:Films based on Norwegian novels Category:Films directed by Ole Bornedal Category:Films produced by Paulo Branco Category:Films scored by Marco Beltrami Category:Films set in Norway Category:Norwegian drama films Category:English-language Norwegian films Category:2000s English-language films
49153483	I Am Ali	I Am Ali is a 2014 documentary directed by Clare Lewins. It covers the life of professional boxer Muhammad Ali. The film tells his story using personal audio recordings Ali made himself during the 1970s. Additionally, interviews of friends, family members, and people associated with professional boxing, combined with archival footage of Ali, are used throughout the movie. Notable appearances in the film include George Foreman, Jim Brown, and Mike Tyson. ==Overview== The film begins with a phone call between Ali and his daughter Hana that took place on November 30, 1979. In the call Ali tells Hana, a young child at the time, that he might fight in one final boxing match. Hana tells him not to do it. The film then transitions to Ali's last professional fight, which took place in 1981, two years later. According to director Clare Lewins, she did not want to cover Ali's entire life in a linear manner, but instead wished to start with his decision to accept that final professional fight. From there, glimpses of Ali's life are shown through archival footage, interviews with friends and family, and many more of Ali's personal audio recordings. Notable periods of his life are covered by interviews with those who knew him best, and others who considered themselves fans and admirers. Through these devices the documentary looks back at Ali's life, beginning with early childhood. Scenes include a retelling of the theft of Ali's bicycle when he was a child. That crime played a key role in his entering the sport of boxing when he was twelve years old. Ali's brother Rahaman states that even from those early teen years Ali felt he would become one of the greatest boxers of all time. Numerous audio clips from various sources featuring Ali's voice are presented throughout the movie. A wide range of moments are covered in these recordings. They include Ali singing with his daughter Hana, his discussions with the White House, and a conversation with a pizza delivery man who stopped by Ali's home. The documentary also focuses on Ali's relationship to the boxing world. Ali's boxing matches with various rivals, including Joe Frazier, George Foreman, and Sonny Liston are discussed. Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson talks about how he aspired to fight at the same level as Ali. George Foreman shares how Ali would tease and taunt him during their boxing matches. Singer Tom Jones talks about his admiration for Ali's boxing skills and persona. Former business manager Gene Kilroy weighs in on several topics. Also interviewed is photographer Carl Fischer, who took photos of Ali for the cover of Esquire. Another topic touched on is Ali's conversion to Islam, including why he changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali. That line of exploration also includes Ali's conscientious objector status to the Vietnam War, and his refusal to join the military based on his religious beliefs. Ebony described the film as follows: > I Am Ali shows the rarely seen personal side of a man who outside of > changing the world and moving like a butterfly inside the ring, managed to > bring together a family through phone calls strengthened by blood and > purpose. ==Reception== Of the film, Ali's daughter Hana felt her father would be happy with Lewins' direction of the film, especially the depiction of Ali's "loving side." The Chicago Tribune said, "At its best, I Am Ali offers something the big-budget biopic Ali could not: casual intimacy." NPR stated, "What distinguishes Lewins' entertaining-if-not-terribly-revelatory film from the many Ali documentaries that have come before is its focus on this most public of personalities as a friend and father." The Guardian called the film "warm hearted and respectful" and a "very watchable tribute" though it felt it might not live up to other films about Ali. ==Music== There was no soundtrack album issued with the music of the film. The tracks featured in the film were the following:I Am Ali, Soundtrack.Net *"Driving South" (composed by Jimi Hendrix) performed by Jimi Hendrix *"I Wish" (Stevie Wonder) by Stevie Wonder *"Louisville KY" (Sonny Skyler) by Ella Fitzgerald *"Upside Down Cake" (Thomas Newman) *"Vanessa and Hugh's Tune" (Simon Bass, Geoff Dunn, Jonathan Noyce, Simon Bates, Carl Hudson) *"I'm Ready" (Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon) by Muddy Waters *"Walters Blues" (Tim Oliver) *"Moon Over Miami" (Edgar Leslie, Joe Burke) by Ray Charles *"The Orchard" (Thomas Newman) *"Sweet As" (Simon Bass) *"Skip Skank" (Tim Oliver) by Tim Oliver *"Rak & Ruin" (Simon Bass, Geoff Dunn) *"Sportin Soul" (Keith Roberts) by the Peter Dennis Orchestra *"Signed Sealed Delivered" (Lee Garrett, Syreeta Wright, Stevie Wonder, Lula Mae Hardaway) by Stevie *"Eve of Destruction" (P.

49204940	I Am Thor	I Am Thor is a documentary about the life of bodybuilder and rock musician Jon Mikl Thor of the band Thor. The film was directed by Ryan Wise and produced by Ryan Wise and Alan Higbee and had its world premiere at the 2015 Slamdance Film Festival. == Plot == I am Thor is the story of Jon Mikl Thor, a bodybuilding, steel bending, brick smashing rock star in the 1970s and 1980s whose theatrical band Thor hit the scene alongside Metallica and Kiss, but never achieved the gold record status of its contemporaries. After a brief but memorable film career saw him starring in the cult classics Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare and Zombie Nightmare, Thor all but disappeared from the entertainment map. But ten years into retirement, and incapable of living like a normal mortal human being, Thor attempts a comeback to achieve the level of success that had eluded him his entire career – a comeback that nearly kills him. Tracing the rise, fall, and rebirth of a determined performer over the course of a career that has seen more than its fair share of highs and lows, I AM THOR paints a fascinating and sometimes unbelievable portrait of this larger-than-life icon. == Release == After premiering at the Slamdance Film Festival in January 2015 the film then went on to screen at film festivals including Florida Film Festival, Calgary Underground FIlm Festival, Brooklyn Film Festival, New Zealand International Film Festival, and the Fantasia International Film Festival where it won the Audience Award for Best Documentary. It was picked up for worldwide distribution by MPI Media Group where it was released in theaters and video-on-demand on November 20, 2015.

The film was released on DVD and Blu-Ray in the United States on January 19, 2016. The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and VOD in Canada on March 11, 2016. The film was released on Netflix in USA, Canada, and Scandinavia in June, 2016. == Reception == The film received positive reviews from critics.

4926298	I & I Survived	I & I Survived is the seventh full-length studio album by hardcore punk band Bad Brains. This album inverts the emphasis of Bad Brains' previous albums, which stress their punk/metal/hard rock side alongside touches of reggae. In contrast, I & I Survived is a mostly instrumental offering emphasizing reggae, ska, and dub elements (including a horn section on several songs) with only occasional forays into hard rock and punk music. The voice of band vocalist H.R. does appear on the album, albeit in sampled form from previous albums. The album includes new songs alongside completely revamped remakes of a few Bad Brains classics such as 1983's "How Low Can a Punk Get?", two versions of the Quickness classic "Gene Machine", and a dancehall reggae version of the usually mellow "I & I Survive". Critic Todd Kristel of Allmusic.com gave the album 3-out-of-5 stars, describing it as "a solid effort even if it doesn't break a lot of new ground".Kristel, Todd.

49369953	I Am Brian Wilson	I Am Brian Wilson: A Memoir is the second autobiographical memoir of American musician Brian Wilson, written by journalist Ben Greenman through several months of interviews with Wilson. It was intended to supplant Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story, Wilson's disowned autobiography from 1991. I Am Brian Wilson was published by Da Capo Press on October 11, 2016, one month after the release of Mike Love's autobiography: Good Vibrations: My Life as a Beach Boy. ==Background== thumb|left|upright=0.8|Wilson performing in 2015 The memoir was announced in April 2013, reported to be written with journalist Jason Fine, published by Coronet Books, and given a 2015 release date. While Wilson's website stated that he "will describe for the first time the epic highs and lows of his life", The Guardian noted that Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story had covered many of the same topics mentioned by the site. However, the 1991 book is considered "controversial" in Wilson lore, and predates his solo resurgence of the 2000s. In June 2015, Wilson reported: "One guy crapped out on me, so I’m doing it with somebody else. It has to be done." In February 2016, it was reported that the book was "years in the making and [has] already seen at least one co-author hired and fired". Wilson said that the book was about "three-quarters" finished and that it was being written with help from friend Ray Lawlor. He likened the writing process to therapy, saying: "There are a lot of memories that go along with my book. I have to take the good memories with the bad memories." The book was ultimately completed with New York-based writer Ben Greenman. According to Wilson, the process involved many telephone interviews over the course of eight months, each lasting about 40 minutes. Greenman then put together the book. When asked how he dealt with his inability to recollect some events, Wilson responded: "Well, the book needed to be factual. We did the movie [2015's Love & Mercy] first, which was factual—but it had parts of it that weren't actually as factual—but doing it helped my memory. So that helped with writing the book, which is almost all factual. I hope people can relate to it because none of it's fiction, as wild as some of it seems. It's fact!" ==Legitimacy== Free Beacons C.W. Mahoney suggests that the book's authorship may not be any more legitimate than My Own Story. Journalist David Hepworth also wrote that "one senses" it was "guided by Wilson's wife and manager, Melinda". Earlier in 2014, the project was met with skepticism by former collaborator Van Dyke Parks, who was approached for questioning by Fine's assistant via Twitter, responding, "Doesn't sound 'auto' to me!" When asked about negative comments Wilson made in the book, Love responded: "He's not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there's not tape of it. But, I don't like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I know he has a lot of issues. Out of compassion, I don't respond to everything that is purportedly said by him." As of November 2016, Love has not read Wilson's book. ==Critical response== Forbes Brad Auerbach calls the book "a wonderful insight into a troubled genius ... his voice definitely comes through. ... Like many autobiographies, Wilson follows a generally linear approach, but he often skips around a straight chronological approach. This works well, as his mind connects sounds and visions across decades." The Wall Street Journals David Kirby wrote that "Wilson’s poker-faced acceptance [is] a reminder to take life as it comes. Part of the charm of his account is the way he drops little moments into the story with no preamble and then moves on with no follow-through." The New York Times Alan Light reviewed: "At its best, I Am Brian Wilson has an odd, unpredictable rhythm, ... it does offer some fascinating glimpses under the hood." Comparing it to Love's book, Telegraphs Helen Brown characterizes I Am Brian Wilson as having "more sadness ... and more moments of magic." She surmised that it "must have been torture" for Greenman to "drag anything out of Wilson ... [who] admits to memory problems and to making things up to 'test' people. ... Whatever Greenman’s pain, the torture was probably greater for Wilson, who prefers to evade his traumatic past when questioned and speaks mostly in banalities – when he speaks at all." Mahoney believes that Greenman "must have languished for hours on end as Wilson oozed in and out of consciousness in his La-Z-Boy ... Greenman did a nice job of capturing Wilson's authorial voice, but is it a voice worth hearing?". Hepworth criticized the authors of both books for their lack of self-awareness, and Wilson's book specifically for having a tendency to "perfect[ly] recall ... every compliment he has ever been paid by a well-known musician." Mahoney unfavorably compared Wilson to a grown-up version of Anthony Fremont (the child tyrant character from The Twilight Zone). He noted that the book contains "no real revelations about [Wilson's] troubled family relationships, few lurid stories of his legendary drug abuse, [and] zero epiphanies about his creative mind". According to Mahoney, "Wilson’s own experiences have left him completely devoid of insight ... Instead, they regurgitate anecdotes that have been floating around the mythology already ... Wilson also takes the opportunity to elaborate his victim narrative ... While Wilson deserves pity for his struggles with sanity, that pity is stretched to the breaking point when you realize how [many millions of dollars] he could afford to throw away." ==See also== * "Brian Wilson is a genius" ==References== Category:American biographies Category:Brian Wilson Category:Music autobiographies Category:American memoirs Category:Books about rock musicians Category:Da Capo Press books Category:2016 non-fiction books Category:Collaborative non-fiction books Category:Authorship debates Category:Books about the Beach Boys
4946722	I Am What I Am (George Jones album)	I Am What I Am is an album by American country music artist George Jones released in 1980 on Epic Records label. On July 4, 2000, the CD version was reissued with four previously unreleased bonus tracks on the Legacy Recordings label. ==Recording and composition== By 1980, Jones had not had a number one single in six years and, dogged by no shows and substance abuse, many critics began to write him off. However, the singer stunned the music industry in April when "He Stopped Loving Her Today" was released and shot to number one on the country charts, remaining there for 18 weeks. The song was written by Bobby Braddock and Curly Putman and tells the story of a friend who has never given up on his love; he keeps old letters and photos from back in the day and hangs on to hope that she would "come back again". The song reaches its peak in the chorus, revealing that he indeed stopped loving her when he died and the woman does return—for his funeral. In a lesser singer's hands, the song might have sounded corny or even comical but Jones' interpretation, buoyed by his brilliant delivery of the line "...first time I'd seen him smile in years", gives it a mournful, gripping realism. When it began being played on the radio in the spring of 1980, just about everyone who heard it was floored. According to producer Billy Sherrill and Jones himself, the singer hated the song when he first heard it. In Bob Allen's biography of the singer, Sherrill states, "He thought it was too long, too sad, too depressing and that nobody would ever play it...He hated the melody and wouldn't learn it." Sherrill also claims that Jones frustrated him by continually singing the song to the melody of the Kris Kristofferson hit "Help Me Make It Through the Night". In the 1989 Same Ole Me retrospective, Sherrill recalls a heated exchange during one recording session: "I said 'That's not the melody!' and he said 'Yeah, but it's a better melody.' I said 'It might be—Kristofferson would think so too, it's his melody!'" In the same documentary, Sherrill claims that Jones was in such bad physical shape during this period that "the recitation was recorded 18 months after the first verse was" and added that the last words Jones said about "He Stopped Loving Her Today" was "Nobody'll buy that morbid son of a #####". A big part of Jones' success over the years was that he could always smell a hit but this time his instincts were woefully off. Although he had disliked "He Stopped Loving Her Today" when it was first offered to him, Jones ultimately gave the song credit for reviving his flagging career, stating that "a four-decade career had been salvaged by a three-minute song." It was more like a phenomenon than a song; Jones earned the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1980 and the Academy of Country Music awarded the song Single of the Year and Song of the Year in 1980. It also became the Country Music Association's Song of the Year in both 1980 and 1981. Since 1975, the singer had scored only one top ten LP (1976's Alone Again) so Epic and Sherrill were quick to capitalize on the success of the single in 1980 by getting Jones in the studio to record some brand new songs. As he had done in the early days of Jones's marriage to Tammy Wynette (and during the dark days following their divorce), the veteran producer cherry picked songs that sounded as if they were pages torn from the singer's life. While Jones's recent albums with Sherrill had been accused of being erratic at times, I Am What I Am contained just about everything a fan could want from a George Jones record, including hard drinking songs like the self-explanatory "I've Aged Twenty Years In Five" and "If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me (Her Memory Will)", which rose to number 8 on the singles chart in 1981. In his essay for the Sony reissue of the album, Glen Gass of the Indiana University School of Music calls "If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me" "a manifesto of existential barroom despair" that would have been a "tossed off novelty" in another singer's hands (During performances of the song, Jones would jokingly conclude it by replacing "her memory will" with "Tammy's memory will"). Another drinking song, the musically upbeat "Bone Dry", explores in hellish detail the withdrawal associated with alcohol addiction. "Cheatin' songs" are also represented with the coy "I'm The One She Missed Him With Today" and the honky-tonk ballad "Brother To The Blues". Jones forte had always been the ballad, of course, and his rendition of the Tom T. Hall composition "I'm Not Ready Yet", which like "He Stopped Loving Her Today" includes a recitation, peaked at number 2 on the charts. The singer even got one of his own songs, "A Hard Act To Follow", on the album, which he wrote with Earl Montgomery, and finally recorded his own version of the country classic "Good Hearted Woman". There was no information provided in the liner notes on the four bonus tracks added to the 2000 Legacy CD edition other than songwriting credits for three of the four songs, with "Am I Losing Your Memory or Mine?" credited to "writer unknown", and stating all four were "previously unreleased". There was no mention of when these songs were originally recorded. ==Reception== I Am What I Am peaked at number 7 on the Billboard country album charts, his first top 10 album in five years, and even appeared on the Billboard Top 200 at 132. The phoenix-like reemergence of Jones only made the performances of the songs more captivating for listeners, as Glen Gass observed in 2000: "I Am What I Am is music from the abyss. The 1980 album was released at a time when George Jones seemed as likely to die than resurrect his career, after a personal disintegration that shocked even his most hardcore friends and fans." Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic raves "the production is commercial without being slick, the songs are balanced between aching ballads and restrained honky tonk numbers, and Jones gives a nuanced, moving performance...like the best country music, these are lived-in songs that are simple, direct, and emotionally powerful, even with the smooth production." Sputnikmusic calls the album "As raw as the cheapest whiskey, as pretty as the girl you can’t forget...George took his tenor, along with the mainstay Country music themes of drinking and heartbreak, and made the entire genre his own." Amazon.com calls it "an unassailable classic of modern country music." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * George Jones – vocals *Billy Sanford – guitar *Pete Wade – guitar *Phil Baugh – guitar *Pete Drake – pedal steel guitar *Henry Strzelecki – bass guitar *Jerry Carrigan – drums *Hargus "Pig" Robbins – piano *Charlie McCoy – harmonica *Bob Moore – upright bass *Bob Wray – bass guitar ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1980–1981) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1981) Position US Top Country Albums (Billboard) 6 Chart (1982) Position US Top Country Albums (Billboard) 17 ==Certifications== ==References== Category:1980 albums Category:George Jones albums Category:Epic Records albums Category:Albums produced by Billy Sherrill

It was selected to be screened in the Special Presentations section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. and won the award for Best Achievement in Directing (Feng Xiaogang) at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards. It was released in China on 18 November 2016. ==Synopsis== The main protagonist, Li Xuelian, is a woman who divorces her husband in order to side-step Chinese law, which states that married couples can only own one property. In order to purchase another property, Li and her husband concoct a plan to divorce so that they can buy a second property. However, in the process of this, her now ex-husband marries another woman and denies ever agreeing to such a deal with Li. To further outrage and distance himself, he accuses Li of sleeping with other men (prostitution/being Madame Bovary). Li, outraged by this, goes to the local authorities to nullify the divorce so that she may legitimately divorce her husband. Authorities are puzzled by this as Li is already divorced. Li explains her principled approach, first to the local police that she and her husband agreed to divorce under the guise of buying property, but now she wishes to undertake a legitimate divorce. Li crusades for her cause, escalating her issue through each bureaucratic step in the system, from the local police, to local judiciary, to local magistrate, then to the Provincial authorities. During Li's journey, she tries to hire her friends as hitmen to kill her ex-husband, is accused by her ex-husband of fooling around with other men, is arrested and sent to re-education camps, falsely led into an intimate relationship with a man in an effort by local authorities of ceasing her crusade, goes all the way to Beijing to protest her principled stance on nullifying her divorce. During her persistent crusade, her ex-husband dies, leading Li to lament over her, now, inability to seek retribution for her ex- husband's illicit affair and branding her a prostitute. The movie concludes with Li settling alone in Beijing, running a noodle restaurant where she encounters one of the local officials who impeded her during her early crusade. She recounts her tale with the official (who was fired as a result of her crusade) and reveals that she initially divorced not to buy property, but so they could have two children. Li was pregnant at the time of the divorce and a divorce would mean she and her ex could "re"-marry and have another child. However, during her divorce and crusade, she had a miscarriage and lost the baby. The movie concludes with Li accepting her fate and life for what it is and lets go of her angst and hate. ==Cast== * Fan Bingbing as Li Xuelian, a village woman * Da Peng as Wang Gongdao, the judge * Yin Yuanzhang as Gu Daxing * Feng Enhe as retired Chief Justice * Liu Xin as Justice Xun * Zhao Yi as Police Chief * Zhao Lixin as County Chief Shi Weimin * Jiang Yongbo as Mayor Cai * Zhang Yi as Jia Congming * Liu Hua as Lao Hu * Li Zonghan as Qin Yuhe * Guo Tao as Zhao Datou, Xuelian's classmate * Huang Jianxin as Governor Chu * Gao Ming as leader * Yu Hewei as Zheng Zhong * Zhang Jiayi as the magistrate * Tian Xiaojie as Secretary of Mayor * Li Chen as Police officer * Hu Ming as Hospital driver * Fan Wei as Guo Nong, orchard owner * Feng Xiaogang (uncredited) as narrator ==Production== I Am Not Madame Bovary is Feng Xiaogang, Liu Zhenyun and Fan Bingbing's second collaboration together, twelve years after their first, Cell Phone.

The song talked about how one woman's musician boyfriend leaving her with questions about how he was running off without giving the woman a hint of what he was exactly doing. Reeves would later say that the reason why the chorus was sung by Wright and not by Reeves was because she and the Vandellas had a touring schedule that did not allowed her to re-record the chorus, which had been changed with different music. The original recording circulates among collectors, but Reeves can be heard singing the new chorus with Wright and the Andantes in the end of the song, on the mix that was finally released. ==Credits== *Lead vocals by Martha Reeves *Additional lead vocals by Syreeta Wright (on the chorus) *Background vocals by The Andantes: Marlene Barrow, Jackie Hicks and Louvain Demps *Written by Deke Richards & Debbie Dean *Produced by Deke Richards ==Chart performance== The song nearly returned the group to the top 40 on the Billboard singles chart peaking at number 42 and reaching number 24 on the R&B; singles chart. ==Cover versions== *"I Can't Dance to That Music You're Playin" was covered in a version by Tina Charles in 197645cat.com Retrieved May 30, 2022. which failed to make the charts, and another version was later recorded by the Beatmasters with Betty Boo and reached number 7 in the UK charts in 1989. ==References== Category:1968 songs Category:1969 singles Category:Martha and the Vandellas songs Category:Songs written by Deke Richards Category:Motown singles Category:Songs about dancing

For the show's fifth anniversary and its subsequent season, it is dubbed as I Can See Your Voice Festival because of its monicker that applies on a randomly-specific theme, affecting the cast and mystery singers. For the sixth season, it is also dubbed as I Can See Your Voice T-pop, with its addition of "T-pop", a shortened term for Thai pop music. ===Filming=== Tapings for the programme took place at the Workpoint Studio in Bang Phun, Mueang, Pathum Thani.

51248235	I Am Waiting (song)	"I Am Waiting" is a song recorded by the English rock band the Rolling Stones. It was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and released on the band's 1966 studio album Aftermath. ==Lyrics and music== "I Am Waiting" was recorded between 6 and 9 March 1966 at RCA Studios in Hollywood, California. The song's lyrics are obscure. They have the singer "waiting for someone to come out of somewhere" but don't provide any details of the circumstances. According to Allmusic critic Richie Unterberger, this is not a problem since "enhancing the general mysterious atmosphere is more important than providing an answer." Music critic Bill Janovitz suggests that the first verse sounds like singer Jagger is "tiptoeing as if in a game of hide and seek." Janovitz suggests that the first refrain begins to suggest that the singer may not just be waiting for an actual person, but rather it suggests "a deepening perception...that promises to offset the paranoia in the lyrics" with the words "It happens all the time/It's censored from our minds." Rolling Stones biographer Martin Elliot interprets the message of the lyrics as "don't fear the reaper." The music of the song is one of several Rolling Stones songs from this period that shows Appalachian and English folk influences. As he does on "Lady Jane," another song from Aftermath, Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones plays a dulcimer on "I Am Waiting." Jack Nitzsche plays harpsichord. Bill Wyman's slow and "eerie" bassline and the acoustic guitars add to the effect. In the song's unusual structure, the refrains are louder and rock harder than the slow verses. In Janovitz's interpretation, the harder refrains permit Jagger to "vent the frustration" that has been built up through the verses. Author James Hector remarks that this allows the song to "[blow] hot and cold with remarkable subtlety" and Rolling Stones biographer Steve Appleford states that the eruptions in the refrains produce a "fine melodramatic effect" and allows the pop music of the verses to "explode into moments of yearning." ==Personnel== According to authors Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon: The Rolling Stones * Mick Jagger vocals * Keith Richards acoustic guitars * Brian Jones dulcimer; . * Bill Wyman bass * Charlie Watts drums Additional musician * Jack Nitzsche tambourine ==Reception== Unterberger calls "I Am Waiting" a "very strange but musically attractive effort" that is a "highlight" among early Rolling Stones album tracks. Janovitz praises how the song combines Eastern thought that was popular in music during the mid-1960s with "broadening sonics and higher fidelity." He states that Jagger "is singing with authority about fear, paranoia and a part of our minds closed from wider perception." Hector calls the song "one of the band's most extra- ordinary mid-sixties compositions." Author Jim Beviglia rates it as the Rolling Stones' #32 all-time greatest song, calling it a "wistful, wonderful track." In 2012 the editors of Rolling Stone rated it the band's #67 all-time greatest song. On the other hand, Elliott does not regard it as being particularly strong, but states that it reflects the band's attitude at the time of "art for art's sake." ==Other versions== "I Am Waiting" was used in Wes Anderson's 1998 film Rushmore. The band performed the song live on an episode of Ready Steady Go! in a performance that Rolling Stone described as "an image of the band maturing in real time." ==Notes== ==References== ===Sources=== * * Category:The Rolling Stones songs Category:1966 songs Category:Songs written by Jagger–Richards Category:Song recordings produced by Andrew Loog Oldham

5153921	I Believe in You and Me	"I Believe in You and Me" is a song written by Sandy Linzer and David Wolfert in 1982. The song was first recorded and released by the R&B; group The Four Tops, who released it as a single from their album One More Mountain (1982). While it failed to reach the US Top 40, it became a moderate hit for the group on the US Billboard R&B; chart, peaking at number 40 in early 1983. In 1996, R&B;/pop singer Whitney Houston recorded a cover of the song for her film The Preacher's Wife and released it as a single. Following its release, the song became a top 5 pop and R&B; hit in the US, also peaking on music charts worldwide. ==History and composition== The original version recorded by The Four Tops was a moderate success, charting at number 40 on the US Billboard's Hot Black Singles chart.The Four Tops AllMusic Due to the bigger success of the Whitney Houston version, "I Believe in You and Me" is most popularly known as a Whitney Houston song. Shortly before the death of Four Tops lead singer Levi Stubbs in 2008, who was sidelined from the group due to complications of a stroke, and confined to a wheelchair, appeared with the other members of The Four Tops, and Aretha Franklin, and sang "I Believe In You and Me" live onstage in Detroit, in his final television appearance on From The Heart: The Four Tops 50th Anniversary Special (2004) on PBS. ===Charts=== Chart (1983) Peak position US Hot Black Singles (Billboard) 40 ==Whitney Houston version== Thirteen years later in 1996, American singer and actress Whitney Houston recorded a cover of the song for her soundtrack album The Preacher's Wife, produced by Mervyn Warren and herself on the film version, and David Foster on the single version of the song. It was released as the soundtrack's first single on December 10, 1996 by Arista Records. Houston received a Grammy nomination for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance for her performance of the song at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards on February 25, 1998. Whitney Houston's version was edited & sampled to create a duet with Barry Manilow for his album My Dream Duets (2014). ===Composition=== "I Believe in You and Me" is a slow tempo R&B; song with strong gospel influences. Written in the key of C major, the beat is set in common time and moves at a slow 66 beats per minute. Houston's vocals in the song spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of A5. ===Critical response=== J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun called the song "the Designated Hit Ballad" and added "[it] is pretty much what we've come to expect from Houston ― a slow, Streisand-esque build-up, a subtle sense of drama and a big, full-voiced payoff in the final chorus." Also American magazine Billboard gave the song a positive review, saying "As she did with Dolly Parton's 'I Will Always Love You,' Houston redefines the composition with a soaring, glass-shattering performance that will leave her legions of fans breathless." While reviewing the soundtrack, Elysa Gardner of Los Angeles Times wrote described it as "a cheesy classic in the tradition of 'I Will Always Love You,' with an instantly familiar melody and a poignant, bolero- like arrangement." A reviewer from Music Week commented, "More serious schmaltz from The Preacher's Wife sountrack. Clearly destined for the Top 20 and anyone with a chocolate box heart." In his review for the soundtrack, Neil Strauss from The New York Times praised the song as one of "the year's most virtuosic pop ballads." ===Commercial performance=== "I Believe in You and Me", the first single from The Preacher's Wife Soundtrack, debuted at number seven and number six, on the US Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B; Singles charts, the issue date of December 28, 1996, respectively.

51618787	I Bomber Command	The I Bomber Command (later XX Bomber Command) was an intermediate command of the Army Air Forces during World War II. It trained bombardment units and aircrews for deployment to combat theaters. From shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor until its assets were transferred to Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command in October 1942, it conducted antisubmarine warfare off the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. The command was activated again for a brief period in 1943, again as a bomber training command, located in the southwestern United States. It was disbanded in October 1943. ==History== ===Initial activation and involvement in antisubmarine warfare=== GHQ Air Force (GHQ, AF) had been established with two major combat functions, to maintain a striking force against long range targets, and the air defense of the United States.Cate & Williams, p. 152 In the spring of 1941, GHQ, AF reorganized its Northeast Air District as 1st Air Force. To carry out its mission of training and maintaining a strike force, 1st Air Force organized 1st Bomber Command at Langley Field, Virginia in September 1941, shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The command was originally established to control and train bombardment organizations assigned to 1st Air Force.Both organizations were established with arabic numerals in their names. In September 1942, the Army established that Numbered Air Forces would be identified with spelled out numbers and commands with roman numerals. It drew its cadre from the 2d Bombardment Wing, which was inactivated the same day, and whose subordinate units were reassigned to the command.Maurer, pp. 374-375 Shortly after the attack, The best trained units in the command moved to critical defense areas or were identified for early shipment overseas. In November 1941, an increase in German U-boat activity brought a Navy request for reinforcement of Army bomber forces in Newfoundland. In the first week of December, the command dispatched the 49th Bombardment Squadron to meet the Navy request.Cate & Williams, p. 157 Then the command's headquarters moved to New York City, New York. Within a month after the declaration of war by the United States against Germany, German Navy submarines began operating in American coastal waters. By March 1942 fifty-three ships had been sunk in the North Atlantic Naval Coastal Frontier. Defense plans drawn up before the war began assigned the Navy responsibility for operations beyond the coastline, with Army aircraft serving in a supporting role.Ferguson, p. 1-2 Because naval aviation that could perform long range patrols was nearly non-existent along the Atlantic coast in early 1942, the burden for aerial antisubmarine patrols fell on the Army Air Forces (AAF), which had available long range and very long range aircraft,At the time, 600 miles was considered "long range" and 1000 miles was "very long range." Warnock, p. 2 but whose crews had not been trained for the mission. Moreover, the AAF's long range planes were armed with bombs, rather than depth charges.Ferguson, p. 4 As a result, the Commander of the North Atlantic Naval Coastal Frontier requested the Army's Eastern Defense Command to undertake offshore patrols with all available aircraft. The first patrols were performed by elements of I Bomber Command, which would be the primary AAF command involved in antisubmarine warfare (ASW) in early 1942, with assistance from I Air Support Command. However, although I Bomber Command was primarily involved in conducting ASW, it was doing so on an emergency basis, and was subject to withdrawal from these duties to perform its primary bombardment function.Ferguson, pp. 5-8 The command used Douglas B-18 Bolo and North American B-25 Mitchells to patrol as far out as 300 miles, and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses to patrol to 600 miles from shore, but in early operations was only able to maintain six aircraft on patrol. For patrols closer to the shore, the command relied on the civilian pilots of the new Civil Air Patrol.Warnock, pp. 8-9 In March 1942, the command received its first planes equipped with radar.Warnock, p. 9 It soon became apparent that if the AAF were to continue with the ASW mission, its units would have to be organized under a specially trained and equipped command.Ferguson, p. 11 The personnel and assets of I Bomber Command were transferred to the newly created Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command on 15 October 1942. ===Return to bomber training=== The command was reactivated as a bomber training command at El Paso, Texas in May 1943 and assigned to Second Air Force, which was training all heavy bomber units and aircrews for the AAF. It was renamed the XX Bomber Command in August 1943, avoiding duplication with another I Bomber Command, which would be located at Mitchel Field, New York later in August.Maurer, p. 437 The command was disbanded in October 1943. ==Lineage== * Constituted as the 1st Bomber Command on 4 September 1941 *: Activated on 5 September 1941 * Redesignated I Bomber Command on 18 September 1942 *: Inactivated on 15 October 1942 * Activated on 1 May 1943 *: Redesignated XX Bomber Command c. 15 August 1943 *: Disbanded on 6 October 1943When the United States Air Force became a separate service in September 1947, former Air Corps units were transferred to it, including units like the command, that had been disbanded. ===Assignments=== * First Air Force, 5 September 1941 – 15 October 1942 * Second Air Force, 1 May – 6 October 1943 ===Components=== Groups * 1st Pursuit Group, 5 September – 9 December 1941 * 2d Bombardment Group, 5 September 1941 – 15 October 1942 Haulman says transfer occurred on 13 October 1942, but AAF Antisubmarine Command was not activated until 15 October. * 13th Bombardment Group: 5 September 1941 – 15 October 1942Maurer, pp. 56-57 * 22d Bombardment Group, 5 September 1941 – February 1942 Robertson says assignment began 4 September 1941, but 1st Bomber Command was not activated until 5 September. * 34th Bombardment Group, 5 September 1941 – 27 January 1942 * 43d Bombardment Group, c. 5 September 1941 – c. 28 March 1942 * 45th Bombardment Group: 5 January – 15 October 1942 * 46th Bombardment Group, 15 May – 6 October 1943 Squadron * 124th Observation Squadron: attached 3 July – 15 October 1942Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 349 ===Stations=== * Langley Field, Virginia, 5 September 1941 * New York City, New York, 12 December 1941 – 15 October 1942 * El Paso, Texas, 1 May – 16 October 1943 ===Campaign=== Campaign Streamer Campaign Dates Notes 200px Antisubmarine 7 December 1941–15 October 1942 I Bomber Command ==References== Notes Citations ===Bibliography=== * * * * 01 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1943
51669480	I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House	I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House is a 2016 gothic supernatural horror film written and directed by Osgood Perkins. It stars Ruth Wilson as a live-in nurse who suspects her elderly employer's house may be haunted, and also features Paula Prentiss in her first major film role in 30 years. I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House had premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2016, and was released worldwide on Netflix on October 28. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised its atmosphere and cinematography, but criticized its screenplay, slow pacing and failure to explain the plot. == Plot == Iris Blum, a retired horror writer, suffers from dementia and lives in a remote house in Braintree, Massachusetts. The house was built by a man for his new bride, but the couple vanished on their wedding day and left the house unfurnished. Iris's estate manager, Mr. Waxcap, hires live-in nurse Lily Saylor to care for her. On Lily's first night in the house, the telephone is wrenched out of her hands by an unseen force. A figure in white walking backwards is seen. A spot of black mold appears on the wall and slowly grows as the months pass. Lily often finds a corner of the rug at the base of the stairs has been flipped up, but she is the only person in the house who walks on the first floor. Iris only refers to Lily as "Polly," which Mr. Waxcap explains was the protagonist of her most popular novel, "The Lady in the Walls." Lily opens a copy of the book and finds that the novel implies that Iris knew Polly during her lifetime and is retelling her story. In 1812, Polly, wearing a wedding dress and black blindfold, walks through the empty house under the watchful eye of her husband. In the kitchen, Lily briefly hallucinates that her arms have become bloated and covered in black mold spots. That evening, she spots the reflection of the figure dressed in white standing in the room but when she turns, no one is there. She discovers a moldy cardboard box hidden away in a closet. Inside are rough drafts for "The Lady in the Walls." She comes to believe that the novel may not be fictitious but rather depicts an actual murder committed in the house. In 1812, the blindfolded Polly uses her hands to feel her surroundings, coming across a wall that has been stripped of its boards - the same section where mold is growing in present day. Polly raises her blindfold and sees the hole, locking eyes with her husband in confusion. Her husband suddenly bludgeons her to death with a hammer and hides her body behind the wall. In the present, Lily tries to discuss the book with Iris. Iris angrily explains that Polly betrayed and abandoned her, and reminds her that even the prettiest of things eventually rot. Polly's ghost visits Iris, whispering in her ear. Investigating a mysterious sound, Lily finds the wall boards removed and piled beside the moldy wall. Turning, she sees what appears to be the ghost of Polly and dies from a heart attack. Several days after, Mr. Waxcap discovers Lily's and Iris's bodies. Years later, a new family has moved into the house, watched over by Lily's ghost. == Cast == * Ruth Wilson as Lily Saylor * Paula Prentiss as Iris Blum ** Erin Boyes as young Iris * Bob Balaban as Mr. Waxcap * Lucy Boynton as Polly Parsons * Brad Milne as Groom * Daniel Chichagov as Darling * James Perkins as John * Beatrix Perkins as Wendy == Development == Writer-director Osgood Perkins originally intended for the story to be about the daughter of a male horror novelist, but he said that "one day, it just changed". Casting became easier once the film was financed; Perkins cited Wilson's talent and excitement for the project as two of the reasons she was chosen to play Lily. Prentiss – a family friend who, as well as her husband Richard Benjamin, had performed with Perkins' father, Anthony Perkins – was the director's only choice to play Iris. In a 2020 interview with director Mick Garris on Garris's podcast Post Mortem, Perkins revealed that the thematic nature of I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House was intended to reflect Perkins’ own attempts at connecting with his deceased father, Anthony Perkins. == Release == I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2016. It debuted on Netflix on October 28. == Reception == Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 60% of 20 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.8/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100 based on 8 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote that the film's atmosphere can not overcome its minimalist and familiar writing. Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter called it "classy vintage horror with a literary flavor" and compared it to the works of David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, and Roman Polanski. April Wolfe of The Village Voice described it as "the most atmospherically faithful adaptation ever of a Shirley Jackson book that never existed" and concluded that the film was "the very best of gothic horror." In rating it 2/5 stars, Nigel M. Smith of The Guardian wrote, "Osgood Perkins layers on the dread in his haunted house thriller. But as it becomes clear that there's no worthwhile story, the scares dissipate fast." A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club called it a creepy, slow burn drama that works despite its lack of a conventional payoff. == References == == External links == * Category:2016 films Category:2016 horror films Category:2016 psychological thriller films Category:American psychological horror films Category:American independent films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:Films about health care Category:Films about writers Category:American ghost films Category:American haunted house films Category:English-language Netflix original films Category:Films directed by Oz Perkins Category:Films set in Massachusetts Category:American supernatural horror films Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s American films
51708233	I Am Not Your Negro	I Am Not Your Negro is a 2016 documentary film and social critique film essay directed by Raoul Peck,MUBI based on James Baldwin's unfinished manuscript Remember This House. Narrated by actor Samuel L. Jackson, the film explores the history of racism in the United States through Baldwin's recollections of civil rights leaders Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., as well as his personal observations of American history.Young, Deborah (September 20, 2016). "‘I Am Not Your Negro’: Film Review | TIFF 2016". The Hollywood Reporter. It was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 89th Academy Awards and won the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary."O.J.: Made in America" wins Best Documentary Feature-Oscars on YouTube The film was internationally co-financed between Germany and the United States. ==Synopsis== ===Prologue=== The film opens with a 1968 interview on The Dick Cavett Show. Cavett notes that Baldwin is often asked a stubborn question: "Why aren't the Negroes optimistic?" He says that many people believe the situation to be improving considerably, with Black people now holding positions of influence across society: as mayors, professional athletes, politicians and TV actors. Cavett asks Baldwin, "Is it at once getting much better and still hopeless?"Transcript: I Am Not Your Negro | Jun 27, 2020|TVO.or In response, Baldwin says, "I don't think there's much hope for it, as long as people are using this peculiar language. It's not a question of what happens to the Negro here, [though] that is a very vivid question for me. The real question is what's going to happen to this country? I have to repeat that." Baldwin continues to assert throughout the film that the fate of the United States is directly linked to how effectively it addresses the plight of Black Americans. The prospects for the entire country and the prospects for Black Americans are inextricably tied together such that the truth and reckoning for one becomes the same for the other. The film is divided into five chapters across which Baldwin weaves the assassinations of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr.. ===Chapters=== The first chapter, "Paying My Dues," portrays the school integration era of the civil rights movement and the fierce resistance to it displayed by many white Americans in an attempt to maintain segregation and the status quo of white supremacy. The second chapter, "Heroes," highlights how white film protagonists are near- universally portrayed through a romantic, heroic lens when pursuing and protecting their interests, even and especially through the use of violence and rape. This is contrasted with the media portrayal of Black Americans who do not even need to be pursuing their interests to be suspected of crimes or deviant behavior and to face the barbaric consequences of those unfounded suspicions. In May 1963, Baldwin calls a meeting with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. With playwright Lorraine Hansberry in attendance, the meeting devolves into a tense standoff and does not conclude amicably. It does, however, contribute to Kennedy's awakening to the significance and urgency of racial issues across the country. The third chapter, "Purity," discusses many of the socially constructed dividing lines which have separated black and white America, as well as the imbalance in expectations for deference, racial purity, social capital, spending power, the achievement ceiling, and so on. In 1965, at a Cambridge University debate with conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr., Baldwin expounds on a recent remark from ex-AG Kennedy: "It's conceivable that in 40 years in America, we might have a Negro president."James Baldwin on a black US President (1965) He makes clear the absurdity and bitterness with which many Black Americans received the remark: "Black people have been here all along, for the entire 400 years since European colonization began. They were kidnapped, brought to America against their will, and subjugated into subhuman, slave-laborer conditions. And yet they must wait 40 more years to even have a remote chance of being permitted into the highest office in the land?" The fourth chapter, "Selling the Negro," tracks the history of exploitation of Black people, from an economy of forced labor at the outset to an economy of imprisonment today. A perennial tension in American life is emphasized, brought about by the historic and continued oppression of Black Americans versus an unyielding effort among many white Americans to convince themselves that any racial problem that may have existed in the past has since been resolved. The fifth and final chapter, "I Am Not A Nigger," elucidates the modern-day condition of Black America by tying the strands of the previous four chapters together. In the closing scene, Baldwin asserts that "I can't be a pessimist because I'm alive, so I'm forced to be an optimist. But the future of the Negro in this country is precisely as bright or as dark as the future of the country. It is entirely up to the American people whether or not they are going to face and deal with and embrace this stranger whom they maligned so long. What white people have to do is try to find out in their own hearts why it was necessary to have a 'nigger' in the first place. Because I am not a nigger, I am a man! But if you think I'm a nigger, it means you need him. And the question the white population of this country has got to ask itself—North and South, because it's one country, and for a Negro there is no difference between the North and the South. It's just a difference in the way they castrate you, but the fact of the castration is the American fact—If I am not the nigger here, and you the white people invented him, then you've got to find out why. And the future of the country depends on that, whether or not it's able to ask [itself] that question." ==Cast == ==Release== The film premiered at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, where it won the Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice Award: Documentaries. Shortly after, Magnolia Pictures and Amazon Studios acquired distribution rights to the film. It was released for an Oscar-qualifying run on December 9, 2016, before re-opening on February 3, 2017. ===Box office=== I Am Not Your Negro grossed $7,123,919 in the United States and $1,221,379 internationally. The film industry website IndieWire attributed, in part, the financial success of the movie to the release shortly before the announcement of Academy Award nominees, opening in an unusually high number of cities, and in non-traditional movie theaters that would generate a word of mouth following. ==Critical response== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 99% based on 206 reviews, with an average rating of 8.90/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "I Am Not Your Negro offers an incendiary snapshot of James Baldwin's crucial observations on American race relations—and a sobering reminder of how far we've yet to go." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 95 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "universal acclaim". The film received low user- generated ratings upon its release on IMDb and Metacritic, leading to accusations of vote brigading. Joe Morgenstern from The Wall Street Journal said, "the film is unsparing as history and enthralling as biography. It's an evocation of a passionate soul in a tumultuous era, a film that uses Baldwin's spoken words, and his notes for an unfinished book, to illuminate the struggle for civil rights." ==Awards and nominations== I Am Not Your Negro was nominated for numerous international awards and won over a dozen, including the following: Award Date of ceremony Category Recipients Result Academy Awards February 26, 2017 Best Documentary Feature Oscars.org Alliance of Women Film Journalists December 21, 2016 Best Documentary Raoul Peck Alliance of Women Film Journalists December 21, 2016 Best Editing Alexandra Strauss Austin Film Critics Association Awards December 28, 2016 Best Documentary I Am Not Your Negro Black Film Critics Circle December 20, 2016 Special Mention I Am Not Your Negro Australian Film Critics Association March 13, 2018 Best Documentary Film (Local or International) I Am Not Your Negro Black Reel Awards February 16, 2017 Best Feature Documentary Raoul Peck British Academy Film Awards February 18, 2018 Best Documentary Raoul Peck Central Ohio Film Critics Association Best Documentary I Am Not Your Negro 52nd Chicago International Film Festival October 21, 2016 Audience Choice Award – Best Documentary Feature Raoul Peck Cinema Eye Honors Awards, US January 11, 2017 Cinema Eye Audience Choice Prize Raoul Peck Cinema Eye Honors Awards, US January 11, 2017 Outstanding Achievement in Nonfiction Feature Filmmaking Rémi Grellety Hébert Peck Raoul Peck Cinema Eye Honors Awards, US January 11, 2017 Outstanding Achievement in Direction Raoul Peck Cinema Eye Honors Awards, US January 11, 2017 Outstanding Achievement in Editing Alexandra Strauss Cinema Eye Honors Awards, US January 11, 2017 Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Score Alexei Aigui Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association Awards December 13, 2016 Best Documentary Film I Am Not Your Negro Diversity in Media Awards September 15, 2017 Movie of the Year Award I Am Not Your Negro Florida Film Critics Circle Awards December 21, 2016 Best Documentary Film I Am Not Your Negro Gotham Awards November 28, 2016 Audience Award I Am Not Your Negro Gotham Awards November 28, 2016 Best Documentary I Am Not Your Negro Hamptons International Film Festival Audience Award – Best Documentary Raoul Peck Hamptons International Film Festival Brizzolara Family Foundation Award for a Film of Conflict and Resolution – Best Film Raoul Peck Independent Spirit Awards February 27, 2016 Best Documentary Feature I Am Not Your Negro IndieWire Critics Poll December 19, 2016 Best Documentary I Am Not Your Negro IndieWire Critics Poll December 19, 2016 Best Editing Alexandra Strauss International Documentary Association Creative Recognition Award – Best Writing Raoul Peck James Baldwin International Documentary Association IDA Award for Best Feature Rémi Grellety Hébert Peck Raoul Peck International Documentary Association Video Source Award Raoul Peck Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards December 4, 2016 Best Documentary Film I Am Not Your Negro MTV Movie & TV Awards May 7, 2017 Best Documentary I Am Not Your Negro NAACP Image Awards February 11, 2017 Outstanding Documentary – Film I Am Not Your Negro National Society of Film Critics Awards January 7, 2016 Best Non-Fiction Film Raoul Peck News and Documentary Emmy Awards September 24, 2019 Outstanding Arts & Culture Documentary I Am Not Your Negro News and Documentary Emmy Awards September 24, 2019 Outstanding Documentary I Am Not Your Negro North Carolina Film Critics Association January 2, 2017 Best Documentary Film I Am Not Your Negro Online Film Critics Society January 3, 2017 Best Documentary Film I Am Not Your Negro Philadelphia Film Festival October 30, 2016 Audience Award – Best Feature Raoul Peck Philadelphia Film Festival October 30, 2016 Jury Prize for Best Documentary Feature Raoul Peck San Francisco Film Critics Circle December 11, 2016 Best Documentary Film Raoul Peck St. Louis Gateway Film Critics Association December 18, 2016 Best Documentary Feature I Am Not Your Negro 41st Toronto International Film Festival September 18, 2016 People's Choice Award – Documentary Raoul Peck Village Voice Film Poll December 21, 2016 Best Documentary I Am Not Your Negro (Tied with No Home Movie) Washington D.C.

It was selected as the Yemeni entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards, the first time that Yemen had submitted a film for consideration. However, it was not nominated. The film is based on the story of Nujood Ali, who sought divorce from her abusive husband at age 10. ==Plot== Nojoom, a ten year old Yemeni girl, asks a judge in Sana'a to grant her a divorce from a horrible marriage after she was married away to prevent a public scandal following the rape of her sister. ==Cast== * Reham Mohammed as Nojoom * Adnan Alkhader as Judge ==See also== * List of submissions to the 89th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film * List of Yemeni submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 films Category:2014 drama films Category:Yemeni drama films Category:2010s Arabic-language films Category:Films about pedophilia
51997729	I Am Beautiful (Rodin)	I Am Beautiful, also known as The Abduction, is a sculpture of 1882 by the French artist Auguste Rodin, inspired in a fragment from Charles Baudelaire's collection of poems Les Fleurs du mal. ==Gates of Hell== The sculpture appears in the Gates of Hell, specifically in the right pilaster, made from joining Crouching Woman and The Falling Man. This group shows the woman with her back to the audience, in a round-like shape, and the man holding her in a manner reminiscent of the mythological deity Atlas. In this and several other pieces, Rodin wants to express a morbid and erotic vision in which sexual satisfaction is unreachable. ==Exhibition== I Am Beautiful was part of an exhibition at the Georges Petit Gallery in 1886, where it caused commotion due to its audacity: the union of the aforementioned pieces forms a symbolic expression of joy and passion that could not be achieved by its component parts, showcasing both suffering--in a figure that folds unto itself--and an excess of reach in an overextended figure. ==See also== *List of sculptures by Auguste Rodin == References == ==External links== * Category:Sculptures by Auguste Rodin Category:Nude sculptures Category:Les Fleurs du mal in popular culture Category:Sculptures of the Musée Rodin
52050851	I Called Him Morgan	I Called Him Morgan is a 2016 Swedish produced documentary film written and directed by Kasper Collin which offers an account of the life of jazz trumpeter Lee Morgan, and his relationship with his common-law wife Helen Morgan, who killed him in February 1972. The documentary was produced over a period of seven years, 2009 – 2016, including three years of editing. Among the participants in I Called Him Morgan are Wayne Shorter, Jymie Merritt, Billy Harper, Judith Johnson, Bennie Maupin, Larry Ridley, Paul West, Larry Reni Thomas, Al Harrison, Charli Persip and Albert "Tootie" Heath. == Festival release == I Called Him Morgan premiered out of competition at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival after being pitched at the 2012 MeetMarket at Doc/Fest. After Venice, it went on to play Telluride Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, New York Film Festival and BFI London Film Festival. After Toronto Vox described the film as it "feels like an Oscar winner for best documentary feature just waiting to happen." The New Yorker dubbed the documentary, together with Moonlight and The Hedonists, as New York Film Festival's Breakout Films. == Theatrical release == I Called Him Morgan had its US theatrical premiere on March 24, 2017. It premiered in Sweden on March 31, in Canada on April 7, and in the United Kingdom on July 28. == Netflix release == On July 24, 2017 the film premiered on Netflix worldwide (to whom it was sold during the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival), except in the UK and Sweden.

After the releases of the acclaimed movies The Irishman and Marriage Story, I Called Him Morgan is the 18th best reviewed of all movies on Netflix.Metascore of all Netflix movies at Metacritic == Reception == There are 20 reviews registered at Metacritic. Eight of them are registered as 100/100, and the film has a score of 90 out of 100. On July 1, 2017, Metacritic announced the film as the best reviewed movie of the first half of 2017. By the end of the year it ended up as the 7th best reviewed movie and the third best reviewed documentary of 2017 based on its Metacritic score On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 96% "Certified Fresh" score based on 52 reviews. The site's consensus states: "I Called Him Morgan doubles as a seductive tribute to its subject's jazz passion as well as an absorbing look at a fatally doomed relationship". In his New York Times review A.O. Scott called the film "a delicate human drama about love, ambition and the glories of music". In Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan noted: > "Artistic, obsessive and intoxicating, I Called Him Morgan is a documentary > with a creative soul, and that makes all the difference. /.../ Using a > dazzling blend of cinematic tools, aural as well as visual, Collin recreates > both individual lives and an entire world. As a slice of recovered and > illuminated time, I Called Him Morgan has few peers. /.../ The film's > centerpiece interview is an arresting one-of-a-kind narrative that Helen > Morgan herself recorded on a cassette-tape recorder a month before she died. > Speaking with writer and teacher Larry Reni Thomas, she details her > difficult life, her relationship with Morgan and how and why she came to > shoot him at a Manhattan jazz club named Slugs in the midst of a blizzard so > terrible that it delayed ambulances, contributing to her husband's death. > /.../ What makes "Morgan" such an exceptional film is that Collin, with a > combination of good fortune and great skill, has built on this excellent > verbal foundation with transfixing visuals that set a powerful mood. /.../ > Regardless of whether you care deeply about jazz, the poetry of Collin's > filmmaking and the poignancy of the couple's story will win you over. As a > piece of history and a personal journey, I Called Him Morgan is cinema to > cherish. In his 5-star review in The Guardian film critic Jordan Hoffman wrote: > "Kasper Collin's I Called Him Morgan isn't just the greatest jazz > documentary since Let's Get Lost, it's a documentary-as-jazz. Spellbinding, > mercurial, hallucinatory, exuberant, tragic /.../ I Called Him Morgan is far > from a traditional documentary.

Variety's film critic Guy Lodge says in his review that > "Few musical genres connote as specifically refined a visual aesthetic as > jazz: Alongside those complex, clattering notes, a lot of immaculate > lighting, styling and tailoring went into the birth of the cool.

In the Wall Street Journal, film critic Joe Morgenstern wrote in his review that "Musicians sometimes paraphrase Debussy, or one another, in saying that music is the silence between the notes. I Called Him Morgan has it all—the notes and the silence, plus the music of spoken language, pitched in rueful tones of recollection." And in the Village Voice critic Alan Scherstuhl notes: "It's fitting that one of the great films about jazz centers on the re- creation of a moment. /.../ Collin and company are after climate, not weather. They steep us in our awareness that Morgan and his New York have been lost, that our glimpses of it must either be through memory or hazed-up photography — or the music itself." In her PopMatters review critic Cynthia Fuchs describes how the documentary in its storytelling deals with memories and what is possible and not possible to know: > "Helen's interview and her husband's story form a dual foundation for I > Called Him Morgan. Layering experiences and impressions, music and image, > Kasper Collin's remarkable film is less concerned with history than with > effects, influences that stretch across time, ideas that shape art. /.../ > Some viewers may be familiar with Lee Morgan's career and celebrated talent, > and others may not know how profoundly he shaped American jazz. For the > former, the film's opening with Morgan's "Search for the New Land" will > recall his 1964 album with Billy Higgins, Wayne Shorter, and Herbie Hancock, > and for the latter, the sound may be a revelation, cool, smart, occasionally > abstract. The track plays over a scene that appears abstract as well, snow > falling against a gray sky, a seeming negative image that makes the snow > look like ash. The snow looks forward and back, to the day when Helen shot > Lee in a New York club calls Slug's, open that night in February 1972 > despite a blizzard. "Search for the New Land" gives way to saxophonist Billy > Harper's recollection: "I just couldn't believe it. I didn't know what to > think, because they were always together." Harper's response to Morgan's > death echoes many you'll hear in the film, from other associates like bass > player Jymie Merritt or saxophonist Wayne Shorter, artists whose lives were > touched by Morgan, and Helen too. "I heard police had arrested her and taken > her to jail," says Bennie Maupin. "And, you know, I never saw her again." > That sense of loss lingers throughout the film. Morgan and Helen first > appear on screen as a photo, held in Harper's hand. Morgan's back is to the > camera, and he's looking into a brick-walled kitchen, where Helen sits at a > table, lighting a cigarette. This photo and others create a sort of visual > backbone for the film, frozen moments of their life together. /.../ Such > stills—alongside some black and footage of performances, with Art Blakey's > Jazz Messengers and Morgan's own bands—offer glimpses of Morgan and Helen's > stories, but only that. Collin's film fills in the gaps for which it has no > visual records with carefully selected abstractions, the snow and the cows, > city streets, blurred traffic lights, New York City bridges and building > exteriors. Brief looks at fire escapes and windows suggest times long past > but lingering, desires to look inside, to understand. As much as the > interview subjects who knew Helen and Morgan tell their versions of what > happened, none has details about how the relationship began or shifted. When > bassist Paul West observes, "His life was restored by Helen and it was a joy > to watch: he was playing, he was producing, and he was living," a few shots > of Morgan illustrate: he's older, he's sober, he's working his PR. As these > images help you to imagine what people describe, they also remind you of > what you don't see. /.../ In exposing and making sense of the fragments and > fault lines of memories, I Called Him Morgan tells the stories of Helen and > Morgan—how they met, how they worked together, how they appeared to others. > It also tells a story of storytelling, how different strands come together > and fall apart, how listeners participate in that process. In this, the film > conjures visual rhythms resembling jazz, montages of image and sound > providing new ways of conceiving the movements of time, of cause and effect, > of interpretation. As it articulates loss, the movie also contemplates > understanding." Critic Lauren Du Graf states in Museum Of The Moving Image's magazine Reverse Shot that: > "I Called Him Morgan casts Helen (the "I" in the film's title) not as a > coldblooded killer, but as a sympathetic and relatable one. She rescued Lee > Morgan from a rock-bottom heroin addiction, clothed him, fed him, housed > him, and bought back his trumpet, which he had pawned for drug money. She > found him work when no one wanted to hire him, and made sure he showed up to > his gigs. She even carried his trumpet for him. By centering on Helen, the > film has a feminist streak, a badly needed course corrective for a musical > genre whose histories overwhelmingly stem from the perspective of men > worshipping at the altar of other men. Like Nellie Monk, Lorraine Gillespie, > Gladys Hampton, and Maxine Gordon, Helen Morgan labored in an invisible > economy of jazz wives who worked behind the scenes to ensure their husbands’ > success and survival. Helen's murder of Lee, the film implies, was a morally > ambiguous crime of passion, a knee-jerk collection on a vast and unrepayable > debt. /.../ The film's portrayal of Helen is also intersectional, showing > how her life was shaped by her efforts to escape poverty, motherhood, and > the limited opportunities afforded black women of her generation. The film > plumbs the unseen corners of Helen's life, taking viewers into the rural > North Carolina hamlet where she was raised. She gave birth twice before the > age of 14. An ambivalent mother, Helen left her children behind in the South > to pursue a life in New York City. She rejected the service jobs typically > offered to black women, and cultivated a community of bohemians at her > apartment, which served as an after-hours spot for struggling musicians to > crash or eat a home-cooked meal." Also the writer Adam Shatz in an article in The Paris Review talks about I Called Him Morgan as unique for its female perspective: > "There is nothing mysterious about the death of Lee Morgan, unlike Albert > Ayler's: Helen was in a crowd of onlookers when she killed him. But I Called > Him Morgan illuminates a deeper, in some ways more intriguing mystery: the > jazz life of the hard-bop era, which saw a confluence with civil rights and > Black Power. What interests Collin is not so much recording or performance > as the intimacy among musicians and their friends. This is a world we know > mostly from the work of photographers like Roy deCarava, Lee Friedlander, > and W. Eugene Smith, who spent time with jazz musicians when they weren't > performing, and captured their intimate lives off-stage. Collin's cameraman, > the gifted cinematographer Bradford Young (Selma, Mother of George, A Most > Violent Year), has clearly studied their work. Snow falling and city lights > in New York; seagulls, trees, and sunset in North Carolina: Young shoots > these recurring images in elusive, grainy textures that give the film a > moody atmosphere reminiscent of the French New Wave, a movement intoxicated > by the sounds of sixties jazz. What Collin is after, I think, is something > just as elusive as Young's imagery: the relationship between creation and > (self-) destruction. It's well known that the world of jazz musicians was > bedeviled by poverty, drugs, racism, police violence, and—a cure that could > end up feeling like a curse—self-imposed exile. What held that world > together and made artistic innovation possible is less well understood. As I > Called Him Morgan reminds us, friendship was one of its pillars: we hear > musicians remembering their times with Lee, and what they remember isn't > only music, but eating, buying clothes, and racing cars at midnight in > Central Park. They were hardly unscathed by competition, but this was partly > offset by a common artistic purpose, and by the hopes inspired by the civil > rights struggle, which Morgan evoked in his epic 1964 composition "Search > for the New Land"—a piece that provides Collin with his leitmotif. Jazz > musicians were trying to create not only a new music, but another country, > to borrow the title of James Baldwin's 1962 novel, which turns on the > suicide of a jazz drummer named Rufus Scott. They could not have done > so—they could scarcely have survived—without fellow travelers in bohemia who > shared their vision and kept them going in the most inauspicious conditions. > /.../ But the most crucial members of the scene, besides the musicians, may > have been the women, most of whom have been lost to history. /.../ Helen > Morgan was one of these women. /.../ One of the great strengths of Collin's > film is that it honors her work and struggle as a black woman from the > South: I Called Him Morgan is as much about Helen Morgan as it is about Lee. > What could have been a judgmental film about a scorned woman who kills her > lover in a jealous rage is, instead, a sorrowful, almost redemptive study of > contrition and forgiveness. We hear Helen's voice throughout the film in a > slightly hissing tape made by Larry Reni Thomas, an adult educator in > Wilmington, North Carolina, who taught her after she was released from > prison. Thomas recorded the interview in February 1996; Helen died a month > later. Warbling and grainy, coquettish yet strong, somewhat reminiscent of > Billie Holiday, her voice carries us through the film, along with Morgan's > "Search for the New Land." She, too, was looking for another country when > she left the Jim Crow South for New York, in her late teens, just as Charlie > Parker and Dizzy Gillespie were launching the bebop revolution at uptown > clubs like Minton's, and on "The Street"—West Fifty-Second Street." == Awards == I Called Him Morgan was included in "The Best Movies of 2017" in New York Times, New Yorker, Time, Esquire, Village Voice, Little White Lies, FLM and more. Esquire magazine's list of the best documentaries of 2017 placed I Called Him Morgan at the top.The Best Documentaries of 2017, Esquire The film was also included in a midyear best-of list in the Los Angeles Times and Esquire, and in similar midyear summaries in The Playlist, Thrillist and Paste Magazine, as well as several lists of best documentaries of 2017. The film was nominated as Outstanding Documentary Film in the 2018 NAACP Image Awards, as Best Documentary in the 2018 Empire Awards and as Best Music Documentary in the 2017 Critics Choice Documentary Awards. It was awarded as the 6th best documentary in 2017 Indiewire Critic's Poll and shortlisted as Best Cinema Documentary in the 2018 Grierson Awards. It has been said that I Called Him Morgan is the best reviewed Swedish produced film in the US since Fanny and Alexander. Nonetheless it didn't receive any nominations in the Swedish 2018 Guldbaggen Awards, which caused several Swedish film writers to wonder what happened. Among them was Jon Asp who wrote in the Swedish magazine Point of View: "The big robbery of the year – the entire film world would probably call it difficult provincialism – is that Kasper Collin's I Called Him Morgan is not nominated for this year's top three documentaries (or any other category)." The Norwegian filmcritic Kjetil Lismoen wrote: "Most people know that juries who pick out nominees for awards are fallible. But in this case, it borders on pure incompetence, or hurtful will. Maybe some of my Swedish film friends can tell me to what extent this is a work accident?" == Others == I Called Him Morgan is director Kasper Collin's second feature documentary.

52058436	I Am Breathing	I Am Breathing is a 2013 Scottish/UK documentary feature film directed by Emma Davie and Morag McKinnon and produced by Sonia Henrici and associate producers Alex Usborne and Justin Edgar for 104 films. It follows the last months of Neil Platt, a young father with terminal and debilitating motor neuron disease (MND). It was funded by Channel 4, 104 films, the Scottish Documentary Institute and Danish Documentary Production == Plot == I AM BREATHING reminds us what it is to be alive - a tale of fun and laughs with a smattering of upset and devastation. Within a year, Neil Platt goes from being a healthy 30-something British bloke with a great sense of humor to becoming completely paralyzed from the neck down, thanks to the devastating illness he has inherited - known as ALS, MND, or Lou Gehrig's disease. As his body gets weaker, his perspective on life changes. His humour remains, but new wisdom emerges: "It's amazing how adaptable we are when we have to be. It's what separates us and defines us as human beings." Knowing he only has a few months left to live, and while he still has the ability to speak, Neil puts together a letter and memory box for his baby son Oscar and communicates his experience and thoughts about life in a blog - and in this film which he was determined to make. The directness of his communication mingles with images of the sensory details of a life well lived, and makes us revalue the ordinary. His blog posts form the film's narration as he tells his own story through memories and impressions of his life - the sheer joy of falling in love, of partying with his mates, of fast motorbike rides. Through his determination to share his final journey, he makes us ask questions about our own lives. == Release == The film was released by Distrify on MotorNerone disease awareness day 21 June 2013 with 130 screenings in 30 countries. The strategy was to raise awareness about motor neurone disease and raise funds for research. The MND association launched a major advertising campaign with posters on London's tube network.

52162162	I Anti-Aircraft Corps (United Kingdom)	I Anti-Aircraft Corps (I AA Corps) was a high-level formation of Britain's Anti-Aircraft Command from 1940 to 1942. It defended Southern England and Wales during the Blitz and the middle years of the Second World War. ==Origin== AA Command had been created in 1938 to control the Territorial Army's rapidly-expanding anti-aircraft (AA) organisation within Air Defence of Great Britain. On the outbreak of war in September 1939, it commanded seven AA Divisions, each with several AA Brigades, disposed around the United Kingdom.Sir Frederick Pile's despatch.Routledge, p. 65.Farndale, p. 5.Robert Palmer, A Concise History of Anti-Aircraft Command (History and Personnel) at British Military History. Continued expansion made this organisation unwieldy, so in November 1940 – during the Luftwaffe's nightly Blitz on London and other British cities – five further AA Divisions were organised, and all the divisions grouped under three corps headquarters directly subordinate to AA Command. The largest of these was I AA Corps, covering Southern England and South Wales, which by February 1941 comprised five AA divisions and 20 brigades. Its boundaries roughly coincided with No. 10 Group RAF and No. 11 Group RAF of RAF Fighter Command.Routledge, p. 394.Frederick, p. 1047. ==Order of battle== I AA Corps had the following organisation from February 1941:Routledge, p. 394 & Map 34; Table LXV, p. 396.Farndale, Annex D, pp. 257–9.AA Command structure at British Military History.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81.

It was responsible for the London Inner Artillery Zone and the Thames North and South AA belts, together with major Gun Defence Areas (GDAs) around Dover, the Solent, Plymouth, Bristol and South Wales, with 'Indicator Belts' and 'Killer Belts' of searchlights in between, the former working with the GDAs and RAF Sectors, the latter with the night fighters in the air. Redeployment was called for in 1942 when the Luftwaffe began the 'Baedeker raids' on cities such as Bath, Canterbury and Exeter, that had previously warranted little AA defence. Later, further redeployment, particularly of light AA guns, was necessary when the south coast towns of England were attacked by 'hit and run' raids, mainly by single-engined fighter-bombers, often evading radar detection, in what became known as the 'Battle of the Fringe Targets'.Routledge, pp. 387–404 & Map 35. In August 1942 the 3rd AA Divisional HQ was moved south from Scotland to join I AA Corps and assist in controlling the large number of AA units brought by this redeployment.Routledge, pp. 402–3. It was given control of 27th, 47th and 64th AA Bdes, but this lasted only for a short time. ==Disbandment== The AA Corps and Divisional HQs were disbanded on 30 September 1942 and a replaced by a more flexible system of AA Groups, each aligned with a Group of RAF Fighter Command. The area covered by I AA Corps became the responsibility of three of the new groups: 1st AA Group (London) and 2nd AA Group (South East England) with 11 Group RAF, and 3rd AA Group (South West England and South Wales) with 10 Group RAF.Routledge, p. 401 & Map 36. ==Notes== ==References== * * Gen Sir Martin Farndale, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery: The Years of Defeat: Europe and North Africa, 1939–1941, Woolwich: Royal Artillery Institution, 1988/London: Brasseys, 1996, . * J.B.M.

52169775	I Am Seven	I Am Seven (stylized I AM SE7EN) is the third mini-album by South Korean recording artist Seven. It was released on October 14, 2016, under Eleven9 Entertainment and distributed by LOEN Entertainment. Following a hiatus lasting nearly five years, the record is his first release since his military service scandal in 2013 and departure from YG Entertainment the following year. ==Background== Seven was subject to conscription in South Korea and enlisted for military service on March 19, 2013. In June of that year, Seven was among three celebrities filmed "visiting illegal massage parlors that provide adult services while on official leave to perform at a concert"; he spent ten days in military prison for breaching regulations. As a result, he split from longstanding girlfriend Park Han-byul. He completed his service in December 2014; his contract with YG Entertainment expired the following February, with both parties mutually agreeing not to renew. In his first endeavor thereafter, Seven was cast in the musical Elisabeth (2015). Seven's return to the music industry was first announced on December 31, 2015. In addition to Rain, MC Mong, and Shin Hye-sung, Seven was among the singers who experienced commercial success in the 2000s who planned to release music in 2016. Seven went on to invest (US$ million) in order to establish his own agency Eleven9 Entertainment. Scheduled to be released as early as March, the mini-album would be first record under the agency. The title I Am Seven represents a "fresh start" and serves as his reintroduction. ==Music structure== Seven took part in the songwriting, composing, and record production of all tracks on I Am Seven, a first in his career. Musically, the record encompasses R&B;, pop, dance, and funk. "Give It to Me" is described as a "retro" funk song coupled with acoustic brass. Written in midst of his military service, "I'm Good" is slow-tempo R&B; track. ==Release and promotion== A music video teaser for the song "I'm Good" was released on July 6, 2016; the full music video was published on the following day. I Am Seven was announced as Seven's third mini-album on the September 29, with a release date of October 14, four years and eight months after his previous release Seven New Mini Album (2012). On October 2, Seven previewed the lead single in Busan at the One Asia K-pop Concert. The music video teaser for "Give It to Me" was published on October 11. I Am Seven and the music video for "Give It to Me" were simultaneously released on October 14. Initiating the day prior, Seven began promoting the song by performing it on weekly music chart shows, including Mnet's M Countdown, Korean Broadcasting System's (KBS) Music Bank, Seoul Broadcasting System's (SBS) Inkigayo, SBS MTV's The Show, and MBC Music's Show Champion. ==Critical reception== Writing for TV Daily, Kim Ji-ha commended I Am Seven for its "impressive" and "addictive" beats and melodies; Kim Han-gil described the record as being "filled with high-quality songs", which allowed Seven to create a "unique ambience". Rating the mini-album two and a half stars out of five, Lee Jong-min of Diffsound described it as a "reckless challenge" which resulted in a "crushing defeat". Due to his military scandal, the mini-album received negative sentiments on online music stores, where netizens contributed to the album's low ratings. ==Commercial performance== On the chart dated October 9–15, 2016, I Am Seven debuted at number eight on the Gaon Album Chart. By the end of the month, the record sold 4,285 copies in South Korea. In Japan, the mini-album debuted at number 245 on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart, selling 226 copies in its first week. It sold an additional 269 copies in its second week, ranking at number 233. ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart (2016) Peak position Gaon Album Chart 8 Oricon Albums Chart 233 ==References== Category:2016 EPs Category:Contemporary R&B; EPs Category:Dance music EPs Category:Funk EPs Category:Korean-language EPs Category:Kakao M EPs Category:Pop music EPs Category:Seven (Korean singer) EPs

52289579	I Am Your Father	I Am Your Father is a 2015 Spanish documentary film written and directed by Toni Bestard (es) and Marcos Cabotá (es). The film deals with actor David Prowse many years after he played the role of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy. ==Synopsis== David Prowse is a bodybuilder and actor who famously portrayed the role of Darth Vader in Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. Unlike most of the other Star Wars stars, however, he is relatively obscure, since James Earl Jones dubbed Vader's voice and Sebastian Shaw portrayed an unmasked Vader (in Return of the Jedi). Prowse lived anonymously in Croydon, a suburb of London. The story begins when a young filmmaker travels to London to propose that Prowse reshoot scenes from the trilogy, to prove that Prowse could have played Darth Vader in that particular scene. In a symbolic way, the directors, assisted by a group of enthusiastic fans, will try to give Prowse the recognition he never had. In this documentary, the directors find some clues about the difficult relationship between Prowse and Lucasfilm, suggesting that the reason for their differences was an article published by a British newspaper during the shooting of Return of the Jedi. ==Cast== * David Prowse, Actor / Darth Vader * Kenny Baker, Actor / R2-D2 * Michael Atiyeh, colorist for Star Wars comics * Marcus Hearn, author of The Cinema of George Lucas * Gary Kurtz, producer of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back * Brian Muir, Darth Vader helmet sculptor * Robert Watts, Star Wars producer * Jeremy Bulloch, Actor / Boba Fett * Lou Ferrigno, Actor ==Production== The film was developed by production companies IB3, Nova Televisió, Singular Audiovisual, and Strange Friends. ==Release== I Am Your Father was originally released in Spain on 20 November 2015. The film was later released internationally through Netflix in September 2016. The film was also featured at the 47th International Film Festival of India in November 2016. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2015 films Category:2015 documentary films Category:Documentary films about films Category:Spanish documentary films Category:2010s Spanish-language films Category:Star Wars documentaries Category:2010s English-language films

5254729	I Could Never Be Your Woman	I Could Never Be Your Woman is a 2007 American romantic comedy film directed and written by Amy Heckerling and starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Paul Rudd. It was released on May 11, 2007 in Spain, July 18 in Belgium, September 14 in Brazil, September 20 in Greece and October 19 in Taiwan. It was not released theatrically in the United States, instead going direct to DVD on February 12, 2008. It was also sent straight to DVD in Italy (February 6), the UK (July 14), Finland (August 6), Australia, Iceland (both August 27) and Germany (December 11), and on February 1, 2011 in France. The film's title is a line from the 1997 song "Your Woman" by British artist White Town. It marked Saoirse Ronan's film debut. ==Plot== Forty-five-year-old divorced mother Rosie (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a scriptwriter and producer for a TV show You Go Girl. Insecure about her age, she uses cosmetics to maintain her appearance. Very close to her thirteen-year-old daughter, Izzie (Saoirse Ronan), they become even closer when Izzie falls for Dylan (Rory Copus), a boy in her class. Despite her ex-husband's urging that she starts dating again, Rosie is single. To the dismay of Rosie and David (David Mitchell) (her British co-writer), her boss Marty (Fred Willard) decides the show can't cover controversial subjects. So, Rosie decides to cast a new character for the show. Taken with Adam (Paul Rudd), a bright and charming young man from one of her auditions, she casts him as a new, nerdy character to fall for the arrogant and self-centered lead actress's character, Brianna (Stacey Dash). The new character tests well, so Rosie persuades Marty to give him a chance. Rosie continues to offer Izzie advice on Dylan, as she becomes smitten with Adam, who suggests they go clubbing. When he picks her up, he bonds with Izzie immediately through a video game she was playing to impress Dylan. While out, Rosie lies that she's 37, while Adam says that he is 32. She is nervous about their age difference, but when he goes onto the dance floor at the nightclub, she realizes they are equally free-spirited, and joins him. Kissing in Adam's car, Rosie admits she's actually 40, and is startled when Adam confesses he's actually 29. Adam assures her that he doesn't care about their age difference at all, and they continue their relationship. Nevertheless, Rosie's insecurity over her age surfaces, egged on by her internal conversations with Mother Nature (Tracey Ullman), and she tells Adam she is not sure that their relationship is going to work, to his confusion. Meanwhile, their relationship draws the jealousy of Rosie's secretary, Jeannie (Sarah Alexander). She sabotages them by stealing Adam's gifts to Rosie, and then his phone, putting a sexy photograph of Brianna on it, and then dropping it in Rosie's handbag. Rosie continues to be nervous when she hears a recording of Adam flirting with Brianna (he was told to do so in order to keep her calm and the center of attention). Things become worse when Izzie has a failed double date with Dylan and becomes insecure about her appearance, something that concerns Rosie. When Adam is first shown on television, he is an instant hit and becomes famous. This leads to Rosie becoming even more insecure, and worrying he will take advantage of his fame and start looking at younger women. Things get worse when the show is unexpectedly cancelled. Shortly after, Adam is given a role in an upcoming sitcom, and she is shocked to discover a speeding ticket sent to Adam showing him in a car with Brianna. Already in a foul mood, Rosie berates Izzie when, during a chance encounter with her friend, Henry Winkler, he reveals that Izzie and her friend had prank-called a number of celebrities in her phone book. Rosie confronts Adam with the photograph of him and Brianna, and he is shocked, having never been in a car with her before. She angrily breaks it off. Despite this, Adam makes numerous attempts to reconcile, including refusing to film the new sitcom he has been offered until she is named co- producer. Meanwhile, Rosie is looking through a bloopers reel of her old show, realizing it was filmed at the time that the speeding ticket claimed Adam had been driving with Brianna, and deduces that Jeannie was behind it. As Rosie confronts Jeannie, Marty calls to offer her a job on Adam's sitcom. She hits Jeannie in the face, reducing her to tears. She then reconciles with Adam. Later, at a school talent show, she sees Izzie has finally won Dylan over, and watches as they kiss. Mother Nature reminds her that, in growing older, she is making way for a girl like Izzie to replace her. ==Cast== * Michelle Pfeiffer as Rosie Hanson * Paul Rudd as Adam Pearl * Saoirse Ronan as Izzie Mensforth * Tracey Ullman as Mother Nature * Jon Lovitz as Nathan Mensforth * Sarah Alexander as Jeannie * Fred Willard as Marty Watkin * Stacey Dash as Brianna Minx * Yasmin Paige as Melanie * O-T Fagbenle as Sean * Twink Caplan as Sissy * Henry Winkler as himself * Rory Copus as Dylan A number of British comedy actors have roles in the film, including David Mitchell, Mackenzie Crook, Steve Pemberton, Olivia Colman, Phil Cornwell and Sarah Alexander, as well as Irish comedy actors Graham Norton and Ed Byrne. ==Production== Heckerling's inspiration for I Could Never Be Your Woman came from her own personal life as a single mother raising a young daughter during the making of the Clueless TV show. According to Missy Schwartz in an Entertainment Weekly article on the film, "Every day, she felt increasingly ambivalent about working in an industry that promotes unrealistic standards of beauty for young girls and considers women over 40 to be prehistoric beasts."Schwartz, Missy. "Would You Dump This Woman?" Entertainment Weekly Issue #977 (Feb 08, 2008) Heckerling sent her script for Woman to Paramount Pictures, but the studio was unnerved by the idea of backing a film about an older female protagonist. The script was eventually read by independent producer Philippe Martinez of Bauer Martinez Entertainment, and he picked up the film with a $25 million budget. Principal photography began in August 2005 and ended later in the year. Although many scenes were shot in California, several scenes were shot in London, England to take advantage of tax incentives. In order to cut production costs even further, Martinez suggested to Michelle Pfeiffer to take a reduced salary ($1 million, plus 15% of the gross). ==Release== Bauer Martinez signed a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to distribute the film theatrically, and The Weinstein Company for DVD and non-pay TV distribution rights. MGM backed out upon learning about Pfeiffer's share in the film's revenue. After Bauer Martinez failed to find a theatrical distributor, the film was released straight to video in North America. ==Reception== Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 64% based on reviews from 11 critics, with an average rating of 5.7/10. Joe Leydon of Variety called it "A desperately unfunny mix of tepid showbiz satire and formulaic romantic comedy." ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2007 romantic comedy films Category:2007 direct-to-video films Category:2007 films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:Films directed by Amy Heckerling Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:Films with screenplays by Amy Heckerling Category:2000s English- language films Category:2000s American films Category:English-language romantic comedy films

52831646	I Am a Martinican Woman	I Am a Martinican Woman (French: Je suis Martiniquaise) is a semi- autobiographical novel written by Lucette Céranus (1916–1955), under the pseudonym Mayotte Capécia, in the mid-twentieth century. It tells the story of Mayotte's childhood and young adulthood, including her relationship with a white officer who ultimately abandons her in Martinique with their son. The 1948 publication of this novel made Ceranus the first woman of color to publish a book in France. In 1949, the novel was awarded the Grandprix littéraire des Antilles. Frantz Fanon strongly criticized the novel's treatment of black women's desire for white men in his 1952 book Black Skin, White Masks. == Plot == === Part 1 === The first part of the novel deals with Mayotte's childhood in the village of Carbet in Martinique. She is a mixed- race girl with a twin sister, Francette, although she is separated from her sister at an early age when Francette is sent to be raised by a childless aunt. Mayotte is an adventurous tomboy, and she is the leader of a mixed group of black, white, and metisse children from her school. Mayotte's gang spend their time exploring "the wildest and most dangerous places." Mayotte is also friends with a washerwoman named Loulouze, who is several years older than her. Mayotte's first experience with a biracial relationship occurs vicariously through Loulouze's descriptions of her white lover and the gifts he gives her. The relationship ultimately results in a pregnancy and Loulouze's expulsion from her father's house. She flees to Fort-de-France. When examined for Confirmation, Mayotte fails and is obliged to take classes with the village priest, a handsome white man with whom she falls in love. He is kind to her and occasionally betrays awareness of her childhood crush. Her feelings for the priest inspire her to devote extra time after school to the catechism, so that she can be confirmed. The majority of part one focuses on Mayotte's parents and her respective relationships with them. Mayotte's father is a local politician and cock fighter. He is stingy, except when hosting parties for his politician friends. He is also a veteran of the First World War, and Mayotte's mother explains to her daughter that the war changed him for the worse. Mayotte's mother is a mixed-race woman, with a white mother. This is unusual, because most mixed-race children are the result of a union between a white man and a black woman. The discovery of her grandmother's whiteness pleases Mayotte immensely. Mayotte's childhood comes to an end with the death of her mother. She becomes mistress of her father's house, and her responsibilities increase as her father grows preoccupied with chasing young women. Eventually, he marries Renelise, a young girl only a couple of years older than Mayotte. Against the backdrop of her father's tumultuous relationship with her new stepmother, Mayotte explores love and sex with her boyfriend, Horace, a black man that she describes as "the most handsome specimen of what is considered Martinican." Eventually, Mayotte grows fed up with her father's continued infidelity, both to her mother's memory and to his new wife. She runs away to Fort-de-France where her friend Loulouze helps her get a job and a place to stay. The first part ends with Mayotte attending Carnival and experiencing the attractions of a big city for the first time. === Part 2 === The second part begins in medias res with Mayotte living with a white officer named Andre. She then goes back to describe her separation from Horace, which she explains by saying: "Memories of my father caused me to spurn what my heart craved - physical love." She gives an account of her own rise in the world, from a worker in a sewing workroom to proprietress of her own laundering business. The bulk of this section, which is significantly shorter than Part 1, is given to a non-chronological account of her relationship with Andre. From the beginning, they both acknowledge that the relationship is necessarily temporary. Mayotte affirms that "white men do not marry black women," while Andre speaks extensively of the white woman he met and fell in love with in Algiers. Additionally, Mayotte is not accepted in his social circles because of her race. Just after Mayotte becomes pregnant, the political situation separates her from Andre for good. Andre is an officer for Admiral Robert's pro-Vichy forces, so after the revolt which pushes Robert out of Martinique, Andre is evacuated to Guadalupe with the rest of the soldiers. Mayotte tries to follow him with their son, but she is denied a visa by French colonial officers because of official concern about the seriousness of their relationship. She does eventually make it to Guadalupe by borrowing her sister's identity, but by that time, Guadalupe was also in revolt and Andre was gone. Andre sends her a final letter saying goodbye and making it clear that he never intends to return to her or see his son. Mayotte wishes to tear up the check that arrives with this letter, but she cashes it, because she needs the money to raise her son. Andre's abandonment of her leads her to return home to her father's house and reconcile with him. The people of her hometown, including her sister, are disturbed by her son's whiteness and regard her as a traitor to her race. After her father's death, she resolves to move to Paris in hopes of finding a white man who will marry her. == Authorship == === Autobiography === In 1995, Beatrice Stith Clark discovered that Capécia was a pseudonym for Lucette Ceranus. The details of Ceranus' life differ significantly from those of her fictional creation. For example, the depiction of nuclear family life in the novel is fictitious - Ceranus' parents were not married and her father did not acknowledge her or her twin sister until shortly before his death. Additionally, she had three children whose fathers are unknown, and she left them behind in Martinique when she went to Paris, only coming back to fetch them after earning money through the publication of her novel. Her twin sister, Reine, is also different from Francette in the novel. Francette ends the novel as a nun, while Reine actually went to Paris with Ceranus, and raised her children after her death. I Am a Martinican Woman was Ceranus's first book. It was published in France in 1948. Even before the author's identity was well known, there was a question of whether the text was intended to be autobiographical. The scholar E. Anthony Hurley does not assume that the text is meant to be autobiographical, instead writing that “Capecia’s use of a first-person narrator with the same name, Mayotte, as the author, invites identification between narrator and author and imposes a personal testimonial value on the narrative which invests it with a special authority.” Maryse Condé argues that Frantz Fanon's lack of consideration of the problem of authorship of the text limits his critique, because he "deliberately confuses the author and the object of her fiction. Although Mayotte says je, nothing proves that she was writing about herself." Ceranus did have a relationship with a French sailor named André, who left her just before the birth of their son. Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley reports that: "In response to Lucette’s unanswered requests for child support, he sent her a small sum and, in 1944, a copy of the memoirs of his stay in Martinique." === Multiple authors === Tinsley calls the book "a multi-authored" text because she claims that ghostwriters helped Ceranus write the first part of the book, which describes Mayotte's childhood. Tinsley also claims that the second half of the book is a rewriting of the memoirs sent by André to Ceranus, after he departed Martinique for the last time to go to Algeria. For Tinsley, the number of authors involved in creating the text is significant, because it undercuts the title's claim to be the words of a Martinican woman. == Fanon's critique == === Black Skin, White Masks === In the second chapter of Black Skin, White Masks, entitled "The Woman of Color and the White Man," Frantz Fanon critiques I Am a Martinican Woman and psychoanalyzes the author through her text. Fanon writes: "For me, all circumlocution is impossible: Je suis Martiniquaise is cut-rate merchandise, a sermon in praise of corruption." He views the relationship between Mayotte and André as extremely lopsided, with Mayotte giving everything and receiving nothing in return, "except a bit of whiteness in her life." He describes Mayotte's conception of the world as "Manichean," split between that which is white and therefore good, and that which is black and therefore evil and bad. Because of this, Fanon believes that Mayotte, like all Martinican women, is working deliberately for the dilution of the black race through sexual relations with white men. He writes that, "the race must be whitened; every woman in Martinique knows this, says it, repeats it. Whiten the race, save the race. ... Every women in the Antilles, whether in a casual flirtation or in a serious affair, is determined to select the least black of the men." This attitude, according to Fanon, reflects a profound self-hatred. === Response to Fanon === Gwen Bergner argues that Black Skin, White Masks only considers women in terms of their sexual relationships with men. Therefore, interracial relationships between black women and white men are viewed as simply another sign of colonial domination of the black man. Therefore, Bergner argues that "Fanon’s scathing condemnation of black women’s desire in the second chapter of Black Skin, White Masks, “is illustrative, in part, of his own desire to circumscribe black women’s sexuality and economic authority in order to ensure the patriarchal authority of black men." Bergner highlights Fanon's analysis of Capécia's job as a laundress as emblematic of her concerns with his critique. She argues that, by assuming that Capécia is a laundry woman because she wants to continue the process of bleaching her life, Fanon ignores the economic reality of mid-twentieth century Martinique, where employment opportunities for women outside of laundry work or prostitution were limited. Thus, Bergner writes that Fanon "sees women’s economic and sexual choices as emanating from some psychic dimension of the erotic that is disconnected from material reality." David Macey provides a different explanation for Fanon's antipathy towards Capécia. Macey believes that Fanon's dislike was rooted at least partially in political motives, because Capécia expresses support for the pro-Vichy government of Admiral Robert and denigrates the Martinican volunteers who overthrew Robert. Fanon was one of those volunteers. Maryse Condé writes that Fanon unfairly expects Capécia to be more than a product of her time and to rise above the difficult racial relations and alienation that were inevitably experienced by people in that time. Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley argues that Fanon focuses entirely on the latter half of the novel, which was largely adapted from Andre's memoirs, ignoring the longer first half, which is about Mayotte's youth and which particularly highlights her relationships with multiple Black and mixed race women. Cheryl Duffus writes that, "it is easy to see why Fanon reacted so strongly to the novel: in light of Fanon’s work and of the postwar popularity of negritude, Je suis Martiniquaise appears to be a throwback to an earlier unenlightened age." At the same time, she argues that Capécia intended the novel's politics to be retrogressive, in order to mirror the jolt experienced by Mayotte in the novel, as her mixed race status and sexual relationship with a white man, formerly indicators of a successful life, suddenly became liabilities in the changing atmosphere of the postwar era, amid the rising public commitment to Negritude. == Literary criticism == === Feminist readings === Maryse Condé claims that Capécia's work is invaluable from a feminist perspective, because it provides "a precious written testimony, the only one that we possess, of the mentality of a West Indian girl in those days." Condé also writes that Capécia's work is undervalued, not because of her lack of writing skills, but because of the displeasure experienced by society at large when a woman speaks out beyond the accepted boundaries assigned to her. Lizabeth Paravisini-Gebert argues that the focus on race in traditional readings of Capécia's work has served to "obscure those aspects of the text that which place [her] at the forefront of the development of feminist literature in Guadalupe and Martinique.” For Paravisni-Gebert, one such aspect is Capécia's expressed desire for economic independence, which manifests itself both in her running of a successful laundering business and her determination to only form romantic attachments with men who can support her. Cheryl Duffus writes that I Am a Martinican Woman and Capécia's second novel, The White Negress, are similar in their treatment of the protagonists' rejection by their communities for bearing white men's sons. To Duffus, not only does this rejection mirror Capécia's own rejection by Fanon, but it also serves as "a critique of Negritude and of the gendered double standard so often seen in community-identity politics." E. Anthony Hurley views Mayotte's character as a deliberate refutation of misogynist stereotypes of women. In particular, Hurley highlights the juxtaposition of Mayotte and her twin, because the many differences between the two, despite their genetic similarities, “[negate] generalization about [Mayotte's] life and identity choices as a woman and [free] her to act contrary to the role prescribed for her by the ideological system of a Fanon.” === Queer theory === Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley's reading of the texts highlights the narrator's fascination with other women's nude bodies, particularly in the first half of the novel, before Mayotte reaches adulthood. Tinsley describes the differences between the halves as a shift from an adolescent desire for fellow Martinican women to a desire for white men in adulthood, because of the white man's ability to provide both economic mobility for the narrator and an attractive audience surrogate for Capécia's French readers. According to Tinsley, the homosexual desires latent in the text were disguised to make the novel more palatable, since Capécia needed the money to become reunited with her children. Yolanda Martinez-San Miguel analyzes the novel through Manolo Guzmán's framework of heteroracial erotics, which hypothesizes that the white heteronormative couple is predicated on the quasi-homoerotic desire to marry someone who is like the self, because there is a drive to marry within one's own race. Using this framework, Martinez-San Miguel argues that Capécia's ultimate move to France at the end of the novel is a self-imposed exile that comes out of her suppression of her own homosocial desire for Martinican men and her desire to break the mold by pursuing a heteroracial relationship. === Rejection of interracial relationships === E. Anthony Hurley argues that the novel ultimately argues that "transcultural love is unsatisfying and unsatisfactory," because Mayotte's adolescent relationship with Horace, a black Martinican, is described in extremely positive terms, whereas the sexual aspects of her relationship with Andre are described in part as unsatisfactory and all her encounters with him end with a question. Additionally, her choice of a white man as a sexual partner is, according to Hurley, based more on her desire to access his societal power than on positive feelings of desire, such as those which drive her to seek a relationship with Horace. === In conversation with other texts === In Black Skin, White Masks, Fanon compares Capécia to Nini, the titular character in Abdoulaye Sadji's novel, Nini. Fanon also psychoanalyzes Nini in "The Woman of Color and the White Man," because she rejects the possibility of a relationship with a black man, which Fanon views as a similar pathology to what he perceives as Capécia's fetishization of white men. E. Anthony Hurley writes that I Am a Martinican Woman is in close conversation with D’une rive a l’autre by Marie-Magdeleine Carbet: "each text supports the other, intersecting and combining to provide a framework within which the complexity of the Martinican woman manifests itself." Maryse Condé compares Capécia to another West Indian writer, Suzanne Lacascade, because she believes that both writers enraged men by speaking out through their novels and expressing their own realities in a way that was not subordinate to Caribbean men. Paravisni-Gebert includes Capécia as one of three women responsible for starting the development of feminist literature in Martinique and Guadalupe; the other two women are and Jacqueline Manicom. Madeleine Cottenet-Hage and Kevin Meehan speculate that Lacrosil, in particular, deliberately mirrors the plot of I Am a Martinican Woman in her novel Sapotille and the Clay Canary, in order to respond to Fanon's critique by showing that there are no opportunities for Caribbean women in the thirties other than the life choices that bothered Fanon in Capécia's work. In Maryse Condé's novel Heremakhonon (1976), the protagonist, Veronica, thinks about the fact that she has never had a sexual relationship with a black man, but protests in her internal monologue that "[she is] no Mayotte Capécia. No!" On the other hand, Eileen Ketchum McEwan considers Veronica and Mayotte to be the same type of protagonist, because they are both engaged in a "narcissistic quest" to fall in love with men that reflect the self-image they would like to have of themselves. McEwan sees both as descendants of the titular character in Madame de La Fayette's Princess of Cleves. == References == * Curry, Ginette.

Just a Little Bit" "perfectly as it is fairly similar in sound", noting that it "really gallops along, with a chugging fat synth line as Gina's vocals sit flawlessly on top. This is a lovely dance pop song." A reviewer from Sunday Mirror described it as "high energy".Sunday Mirror. 9 March 1997. p. 33. ==Chart performance== "I Belong to You" proved to be a major hit on several continents.

5302973	I Am Not Spock	I Am Not Spock is Leonard Nimoy's first autobiography. Published in 1975, between the end of Star Trek: The Animated Series and the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, the book was criticized by some fans because of the perception that Nimoy was rejecting the character Spock. He maintained he was only clarifying the difference between himself and Spock, whom he always enjoyed playing. However, he later published I Am Spock in an attempt to address the misconceptions. ==Development history== Nimoy stated that the title originated from an incident in an airport where a mother introduced him to her daughter as Spock. The child was not convinced, and "I am not Spock" subsequently became the title for a chapter in the autobiography that discussed how he went about building the character. In the book he compared Spock's life to his own, in order to explain the differences between the personas of the two. He did state that if he were to portray any fictional character, then he would choose Spock. The chapter title became the book title, which Nimoy later called "a big mistake" as he felt that people assumed that it was an attack on the character and Star Trek in general, but did not read the book to find out what was really meant. During a discussion with the publishers, they decided that the book needed to have Spock in the title, and they felt that I Am Not Spock would attract attention. Nimoy called the reaction a "firestorm". Nimoy later followed up with a second autobiography in 1995, this time entitled I Am Spock, although he also considered the title Maybe I Am Spock. He discussed the response to I Am Not Spock in a feature called "Reflections on Spock", which was included in the Star Trek: The Original Series season one HD DVD set, released in 2007. ==Reception== Nimoy recalled that the fan reaction to the memoir was publicized as being negative and created an assumption that he was no longer interested in playing Spock. He responded to this rumor in his second autobiography, I Am Spock. Based on that rumor, when Star Trek: The Motion Picture was being made, newspapers reported that Nimoy stated in I Am Not Spock that he did not want to be involved with Star Trek any longer. In 2002, Star Trek: The Next Generation actor Brent Spiner joked that his autobiography would be entitled I Am Not Spock, Either. Prior to playing the role of Spock in the 2009 film Star Trek, Zachary Quinto read I Am Not Spock for insight about the possibility of being typecast into the role. ==References== ==External links== Category:1975 non- fiction books Category:American autobiographies Category:Show business memoirs Category:Books by Leonard Nimoy Category:Books about Star Trek

53413609	I Am Providence (Mamatas novel)	I Am Providence is a 2016 murder mystery novel by American author Nick Mamatas. It was first published in paperback on August 9, 2016 through Night Shade Books in the United States and United Kingdom. The work alternately follows two writers both before and after one of them is murdered. ==Synopsis== The book follows two horror writers, Colleen Danzig and Panos Panossian, the latter of whom is strongly disliked in the Lovecraft literary community. Both writers are attending the Summer Tentacular, a Lovecraft themed convention held in Providence, Rhode Island, and sharing a room together. Before the first day of the convention's end, Panossian is brutally murdered, his face peeled off of his body, mimicking an anonymous post left for Panossian on his blog by someone years ago who appears to know a great deal about his past. The novel's chapters alternatively follow both writers. The third-person chapters following Colleen are partially set before Panossian's murder while his chapters are told after his death, as his disembodied consciousness drifts around the convention following participants and thinking about his past. Panossian can feel his nerves dying and his brain shriveling like a ‘sponge in the sun’, and he spends his time lamenting over not remembering who it was that killed him, trying to figure it out, and letting his mind drift into long monologues about his past and opinions, his thoughts on Lovecraft, and his opinions on the other con-goers. Colleen recklessly searches for the truth and believes that there's a connection between "Arkham," the book Panossian was supposed to be selling when he died, and who killed him. The book is rumored to be bound in human skin. She corners Chloe, another one of the authors, in a bathroom where a physical altercation takes place. She then convinces Hiram to give her a ride with partial lies. The truth is that they're following a group of others from the con into the forest, where she believes they're doing something related to the murder. She calls the police and it's revealed that they were just trying to locate the grave of H.P. Lovecraft's long-deceased cat. Colleen is taken in for questioning many times, and is banned from the convention for her assault on Chloe. From the Mortuary, Panossian can hear the interrogations and uses them to further speculate on who may have killed him. After the night in the woods, Colleen finds out that another writer from the con was killed: Charles Cudmore, who she mentally calls "asparagus head" due to his malformed head and haircut. His death is dissimilar to Panossians, leading Colleen to believe that he was killed because he knew too much. She goes to Norman, another's con-attendee's room to look for more info after finding out that a drag queen named Ms. Phantasia and Chloe have been accused. She doesn't get much from this encounter and ends up having to take part in a group attempt to summon Cthulhu. She is taken into custody once more when the police arrive, and during her subsequent interrogation believes that the police are trying to hint at her to help. She is given an eventful ride back to the hotel for the closing ceremonies. During an odd speech on Christianity, Hiram tries to hint at her to leave but it's too late. Colleen is tackled because it's believed that she's the real killer. She manages to escape and an officer drives her out of state. Whilst at the airport, she is looking into some of the con-goers and their pasts and is struck by inspiration. She returns to Providence. From his position, Panossian hears who murdered him reveal themself, an exchange that is overheard by Colleen and Hiram. The book ends with gunshots and Colleen whispering to an unknown other person that it will be okay as Panossian finally slips away for good. ==Reception== Publishers Weekly and NPR both reviewed the work, the latter of which felt that the book's coverage of a niche fandom harmed more than helped the book because "As deep as the book gets, it's equally narrow, and no matter how accessible Mamatas makes his mystery, it's still mired in the in-fighting and minutia of a subculture that few can relate to." Tor.com was critical of I Am Providence, writing "Clearly, there are some great ideas in here, but even if you can get past the flat characters and the circumnavigative narrative and the nastiness of the entire enterprise, I Am Providence goes nowhere of note, oh-so-slowly." Locus Online and Fangoria were more favorable towards the work, with Locus Online stating that "Mythos fans, mystery fans, and convention-goers (some of us are all three!) will all find plenty to like here." ==References== Category:American mystery novels Category:2016 American novels Category:Night Shade Books books

53834367	I Am Not a Witch	I Am Not a Witch is a 2017 internationally co-produced drama film written and directed by Rungano Nyoni in her feature debut film. It was screened in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival and won the BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer for Nyoni and producer Emily Morgan at the 71st British Academy Film Awards. It was selected as the British entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. ==Plot== A serious little girl shows up in a village and it is quickly decided she is a witch. When she refuses to answer questions confirming or denying she is a witch, she is taken to a witch doctor who sacrifices a chicken to determine whether she is a witch or not. Believing she is a witch, the local authorities take her to a small camp made up of elderly witches, each of whom is tied to their own large spool of white ribbon. The girl is restrained with a ribbon like the other witches and forced into labour. One of the elder witches names her Shula. Shula is taken away to adjudicate at a trial where an elderly man has claimed that money has been stolen from him. When the suspects are lined up Shula does not know which one is the thief and calls the other witches who give her contradictory advice on how to catch the thief. Nevertheless, Shula is able to correctly guess who the thief is and is rewarded for it. A senior government employee and his wife continue to exploit other people's belief that Shula is a witch by asking her to perform tasks like summoning rainfall. Shula is gradually exposed to what the wider community thinks of witches and is occasionally threatened with violence. After an appearance on a chat show, where a caller asks why she is not in school, she is sent to a school, where the other pupils, like Shula, are those that have been deemed unacceptable for mainstream schools. A witch doctor and a farmer drag her away from the school by her ribbon and ask her to make it rain. She performs a rain dance and exhausts herself trying to produce results. That evening the women back at camp ask her why she is unhappy and in response she says that she wishes she had opted to become a goat. When the women are asleep she's seen leaving the tent and gathering her ribbon to its end. In the morning two men dump a body in the field and the 'witches' are seen mourning for Shula, although it's ambiguous how she died or whether it is her body. As the women celebrate her death it begins to rain. The truck that carries the women around is shown to be empty, and the ribbons that held them hostage are flying free. ==Cast== * Maggie Mulubwa as Shula * Nellie Munamonga as Police Officer * Dyna Mufuni as Leader * Nancy Murilo as Charity * Becky Ngoma as Bwalya ==Production== Writer-director Rungano Nyoni was inspired by actual stories of witchcraft accusations in Zambia. In her research for the film, she traveled to Ghana and spent time in a real witch camp, observing their daily life and rituals. ==Reception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 78 reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Mark Kermode from The Observer gave the film four out of five stars, praising Nyoni's work, David Gallego's cinematography and Mulubwa's performance and wrote: "Rungano Nyoni’s debut feature, the story of a girl in Zambia accused of witchcraft, is comic, tragic – and captivatingly beautiful" Jessica Kiang from Variety, also praised Gallego’s cinematography and stated: "Nyoni’s approach may itself be a little too chaotic, and a little too oblique to be fully comprehensible (in particular her counterpointing music cues can overreach, and some of the narrative ellipses confuse). But in the investigation of the dichotomies of ancient and modern, familiar and alien, prosaic and mystical, she clearly has a great deal she wants to say, and now, thanks to this invigorating, intriguing and provocative debut, she has a whole career ahead of her in which to say it". Anna Smith, writing for Time Out, gave I Am Not a Witch four out of five stars, stating "impressively, debut writer-director Rungano Nyoni makes this heady mix work". Stephen Dalton from The Hollywood Reporter called the film "A winningly original and stylistically fresh debut feature from the young Zambia-born Welsh director Rungano Nyoni, I Am Not a Witch is one of the more buzzy premieres screening in the Directors' Fortnight in Cannes. A fable- like story about a young African girl banished from her village for alleged witchcraft, it blends deadpan humor with light surrealism, vivid visuals and left-field musical choices". ===Accolades=== I Am Not a Witch gathered several wins and nominations in many important film festivals and film awards, including a win at the 71st British Academy Film Awards for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer and 10 nominations and three wins at the British Independent Film Awards 2017. It won Feature Fiction award at the 2017 Adelaide Film Festival. ==See also== * List of submissions to the 91st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film * List of British submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 films Category:2017 drama films Category:British drama films Category:French drama films Category:German drama films Category:Zambian drama films Category:BAFTA winners (films) Category:Films about witchcraft Category:2017 directorial debut films Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s British films Category:2010s French films Category:2010s German films

539622	I (Cyrillic)	I (И и; italics: И и) is a letter used in almost all Cyrillic alphabets with the exception of Belarusian. It commonly represents the close front unrounded vowel , like the pronunciation of in "machine", or the near-close near-front unrounded vowel , like the pronunciation of in "bin". ==History== Because the Cyrillic letter І was derived from the Greek letter Eta (Η η), the Cyrillic had the shape of up to the 13th century. The name of the Cyrillic letter І in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was (iže), meaning "which". In the Cyrillic numeral system, the Cyrillic letter І had a value of 8, corresponding to the Greek letter Eta. In the Early Cyrillic alphabet, there was little or no distinction between the letter and the letter , the latter of which was derived from the Greek letter Iota (Ι ι). Both remained in the alphabetical repertoire because they represented different numbers in the Cyrillic numeral system: eight and ten. In New Church Slavonic, they co-exist with each other with no pronunciation differences. But in Ukrainian and Rusyn, the two letters have different pronunciations. Other modern orthographies for Slavic languages eliminated one of the two letters in alphabet reforms of the 19th or the 20th centuries. The Russian, Macedonian, Serbian, and Bulgarian languages now use only , and Belarusian uses only . However, the letter was also used in Russian before the Bolshevik reform of 1918. ==Form== Originally, Cyrillic had the shape identical to the capital Greek letter Eta . The middle stroke was later turned counterclockwise, which resulted in the modern form resembling a mirrored capital Latin letter N and so is used in faux Cyrillic typography. However, the style of the two letters is not fully identical: in roman fonts, has heavier vertical strokes and serifs on all four corners, and has a heavier diagonal stroke and lacks a serif on the bottom-right corner. In roman and oblique fonts, the lowercase letter has the same shape as the uppercase letter . In italic fonts, the lowercase letter looks like the italic form of the lowercase Latin U . Both uppercase and lowercase handwritten forms of the Cyrillic letter I look like handwritten forms of the Latin letter U. == Usage == Since 1918, has been the tenth letter of the Russian alphabet, and in Russian, it represents , like the i in machine, except after some consonants (see below). In Russian, the letter typically denotes a preceding soft consonant and so is considered the soft counterpart to , which represents . However, unlike other "soft" vowels (, , and ), in isolation is not preceded by the semivowel. In Russian, the letter could be combined in the digraph (like , and ) to represent before it started around the 1950s, although that letter remains rare as people usually use (apparent confusion has remained in the transcription of some foreign words). was used significantly less in Russian before the Bolshevik reform of 1918: * ⟨і⟩ was used before all vowels and before the semivowel ⟨й⟩ except at the end of a morpheme in a compound word, where ⟨и⟩ was used. So англійскій (English) used ⟨і⟩, but пяти + акровый = пятиакровый (five-acre) used ⟨и⟩. * ⟨и⟩ was used as the last letter of a word and before consonants except in міръ for "world, universe, local community, commons, society, laity" (and words derived from it) to differentiate from миръ "peace"). After 1918, both are spelled мир. According to critics of the Bolshevik reform, the choice of Ии as the only letter to represent that side and the removal of Іі defeated the purpose of 'simplifying’ the language, as Ии occupies more space and, furthermore, is sometimes indistinguishable from Шш. is pronounced in (sounds like ), (sounds like ) and (sounds like ), because in Russian, the sound cannot be pronounced after "zh" , "sh" , and "ts" . In the Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet is the ninth letter. It represents the sound and also occurs with a grave accent, ѝ, to distinguish orthographically the conjunction ("and") and the short form of the indirect object ("her"). In Kazakh, is used for and in native words and for in loanwords, and is used for in native words. In Belarusian, the letter (и) is not used at all, and the sound is represented by the letter , which is also known as Belarusian-Ukrainian I. The letter is the eleventh letter of the Ukrainian alphabet and represents the sound , a separate phoneme in Ukrainian. The Ukrainian can be transliterated to other languages that use the Cyrillic script by either and because of the lack of a uniform transliteration rule. Speakers of other Slavic languages can perceive Ukrainian as , , or sometimes even (see Ukrainian phonology for more on the pronunciation of ). The sound in Ukrainian is represented by the letter , just as in Belarusian. In the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, is the tenth letter of the alphabet. In Serbian, the letter represents , like the i in machine. In the Serbian Latin alphabet, the sound is represented by "I/i". In Macedonian, is the eleventh letter of the alphabet and represents the sound . It is transliterated from Russian as or from Ukrainian as or , depending on the romanization system. (See romanization of Russian and romanization of Ukrainian for more details.) In Tuvan, the letter can be written as a double vowel. === Stylistic uses === Due to its close resemblance to the Latin capital letter N, specifically as a "flipped" or "reflected" version of it, it is sometimes used stylistically as a replacement for N. This is commonly seen in Faux Cyrillic. The industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails notably use both N and И in its logo. The hard rock band Linkin Park have also used the glyph, particularly on the cover of their debut album Hybrid Theory. == Accented forms and derived letters == The vowel that is represented by can, as is the case for almost any other Slavonic vowel, be stressed or unstressed. The stressed variant is sometimes (in special texts like dictionaries or to prevent ambiguity) graphically marked by the acute, grave, the double grave, or the circumflex accent. Special Serbian texts also use with a macron to represent long unstressed variant of the sound. Serbian with a circumflex can be unstressed as well, which then represents the plural form of the genitive case to distinguish from other similar forms. Modern Church Slavonic orthography uses the smooth breathing sign (Greek and Church Slavonic: psili, Latin: spiritus lenis) above the initial vowels (for tradition alone since there is no difference in pronunciation). It can be combined with acute or grave accents if necessary. None of those combinations is considered to be a separate letter of respective alphabet, but one of them () has an individual code position in Unicode. with a breve forms the letter for the consonant or a similar semivowel, like the y in English "yes." The form has been used regularly in Church Slavonic since the 16th century, but it officially became a separate letter of alphabet only much later (in Russian in 1918). The original name of was I s kratkoy ('I with the short [line]'), later I kratkoye ('short I') in Russian. It is known similarly as I kratko in Bulgarian but as Yot in Ukrainian. Cyrillic alphabets of non-Slavic languages have additional -based letters like or . ==Related letters and similar characters== *Η η : Greek letter Eta *H h : Latin letter H *Ι ι : Greek letter Iota *I i : Latin letter I *Й й : Cyrillic letter Short I *І і : Cyrillic letter Dotted I ==Computing codes== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Vowel letters
53980952	I Can Speak	I Can Speak is a 2017 South Korean film based on a true story of comfort women directed by Kim Hyun-seok and distributed by Lotte Entertainment. The genre of the film are both comedy and drama. The film depicts the story of the resolution of conviction for “comfort women” (HR121) of the Japanese military in 2007. Though the film is a comedy, the genre serves as a vehicle to discuss the deeper topic of Korean comfort women. The way that film illustrated Na Ok- Bun's enterprising attitude of her life and her courageously testifying in front of the whole world were applauded. The film stars Na Moon-hee as Na Ok- Bun, with Lee Je-hoon as Park Min-Jae. The scene of Na Ok-Bun's testimony to the United States Congress was filmed at the Capitol Building of Virginia, in the city of Richmond. ==Plot== Nah Ok-Bun is an elderly woman who is notorious for filing citizen's complaint at her district office and is nicknamed "Goblin Granny". When Ok-Bun meets Park Min Jae, a young man who has recently been appointed as a junior civil service officer, she is dissatisfied with his attitude of not caring about her complaints and only trying to do the jobs that are assigned to him. But there is an opportunity for these two as Ok-Bun wants to learn English. The senior class run by the local resident center does not fit her level, and the class at the English academy is too fast-paced and so she is eventually kicked out of the class. Ok-Bun sees Min Jae speaking English very fluently with a native speaker in the academy. Forgetting all the troubles she had with Min Jae, Ok-Bun asks Min Jae to teach her English. Min Jae refuses Ok-Bun's request because he does not want to take on the troublesome role. When Min Jae sees Ok-Bun taking care of his younger brother, Young Jae, he is moved by her warmth and agrees to become her English teacher. Min Jae teaches Ok-Bun and Ok-Bun's English improves. Min Jae learns that Ok- Bun wishes to learn English to continue her friend Jeong-Shim's dream of testifying at the comfort women public hearing in Washington D.C. Ok-Bun and Jeong-Shim were both victims of the Japanese Military during World War II. Although Ok-Bun has prepared what to say in the public hearing, she can hardly speak as she is overwhelmed by the pressure she feels in the unfamiliar surroundings. When people start to question Ok-Bun's behavior, she hears and sees Min Jae in the audience which gives her the courage to testify against the atrocities of the Japanese Military. ==Cast== ===Main=== *Na Moon-hee as Na Ok-Bun **Choi Soo-in as young Na Ok-Bun :A frequent trouble making visitor at the local public government office who has filed over 8,000 civil complaints. *Lee Je-hoon as Park Min-jae :A ninth-level civil servant who befriends Na Ok-Bun and teaches her English ===Supporting=== *Yeom Hye-ran as Woman from Jinju *Lee Sang-hee as Hye-jung *Son Sook as Jung-sim **Lee Jae-in as young Jung-sim *Kim So-jin as Geum-joo *Park Chul-min as Team leader Yang *Jung Yeon-joo as A-young *Lee Ji-hoon as Jong-hyun *Lee Dae-yeon as Borough chief *Sung Yu-bin as Park Young-jae *Woo Ji-hyun as Public service employee ==Reception== I Can Speak was released in theaters in Korea on September 21, 2017.

Blue and J flirt and begin to develop a relationship. J fears that Blue will figure out that J is transgender and break up with him. While this is happening, J runs away from home, staying in a homeless shelter for queer youth. He also switches schools to a queer-friendly alternative high school, where he meets a girl named Chanelle. His parents become worried about his whereabouts and uses Melissa as a bait to help them reconnect. J and Carolina have a few difficult conversations, during which J comes out to her. She does not take it very well, and his Manny, handles it even worse. J stays with Melissa for a few days, but when J comes out to her, she does not get it either. They eventually make up, and Melissa tells J that she is going to participate in a dance showcase with a piece to represent the transgender experience. This does not sit well with J, who encourages that she perform a dance about her struggles with self-harming instead. J starts meeting more and more transgender people through an LGBTQ youth group and becomes confident in his ability to start his transition. He starts testosterone, and gets an opportunity to show off some of his photos at Melissa's dance recital. That same night, at his parents' anniversary party, J finds out that Carolina has been lying to his father, telling him that J was away at a computer camp in DC. They have an argument and eventually realize that they need their space from one another. J moves out for good and lives with Melissa and her mom, but his parents come to visit every once in a while. The novel ends with J opening a letter addressed to "Mr. Silver," where he finds out he has been accepted to a photography program in upstate New York for the fall semester. === Characters === * J Silver is the protagonist and titular character of the novel. J is 17 years old, a high school senior. His mother is Puerto Rican and his dad is white and Jewish, giving him some mixed features; J has dark curly hair and brown eyes. He likes using photography to express himself. J experiences a lot of angst and confusion during the course of the novel, some of which he expresses with anger towards others. * Carolina Silver is J's mother, a Catholic Puerto Rican woman. She works at a hospital as a nurse. With J she is firm but loving, and worries about him coming out as transgender will mean for his future. * Melissa is J's best friend. They met in the 8th grade when a teacher insisted on calling J by his birth name, and Melissa stood up for him despite not knowing him at the time. She is a dancer and has body image issues. Melissa cuts herself and experiences some thoughts of suicide, which J tries to help her with. J has had feelings for Melissa since they met, but he accepted a long time ago that Melissa will never see him in the same way. * Blue is J's romantic interest. She is a painter who is obsessed with the color blue, to the point where she even dyes her hair blue. Her real name is Basia, and she lives with her Polish mother who runs a daycare out of their apartment. * Manny Silver is J's father. He is emotionally unavailable and does not take well to the fact that J is transgender. *Chanelle is a transgender woman who J befriends in the alternative high school. She is a bit older than J and acts as a kind of mentor to him. == Reception == I Am J was positively received by critics for its portrayal of queer and transgender youth. The novel was also referenced extensively in a journal article, published in Barnboken Journal of Children's Research, titled "Re-writing the Script: Representations of Transgender Creativity in Contemporary Young Adult Fiction and Television." Its author, Kate Norbury, emphasizes the value of creativity in the novel, and connects this portrayal to the "creative-achievement script" in storytelling, that gives transgender characters fully developed narratives with notable creative traits. Cathi McCrae, in the September 2011 issue of digital magazine Youth Today, reviewed the book and states that "Beam's novel brings us intensely into J's reality, from his stark sense of alienation to his emerging self-awareness within a new body and community." In Volume 57 of School Library Journal, Diane Tuccillo praised the book by stating that "the story is believable and effective due to insightful situations, realistic language, and convincing dialogue." == Awards == I Am J was named a finalist for the 2012 Lambda Literary Award, in the Transgender Fiction category. The book was featured in the Assembly on Literature for Adolescents's Rainbow List, "an annual book list of recommended LGBTQ fiction and nonfiction titles for young readers," in the Top Ten List section. == References == Category:2011 LGBT- related literary works Category:American young adult novels Category:Queer literature Category:Novels with transgender themes Category:2010s LGBT novels Category:American LGBT novels Category:LGBT-related young adult novels Category:Novels set in New York City Category:Little, Brown and Company books

5485041	I Can See Clearly Now	"I Can See Clearly Now" is a song written and recorded by American singer- songwriter Johnny Nash. It was the lead single from his album, I Can See Clearly Now (1972), and achieved success in the United States and the United Kingdom when it was released in 1972, reaching number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and Cash Box charts. It also reached number one in Canada and South Africa. The song has been covered by many artists throughout the years, including a hit version by Lee Towers that reached no. 19 in the Dutch Top 40 in 1982, and another recorded by Jimmy Cliff for the motion picture soundtrack of Cool Runnings that peaked at no. 18 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1993. ==Writing and recording== After Nash wrote and composed the original version, he recorded it in London with members of the Fabulous Five Inc., and produced it himself. The song's arrangements and style are both heavily laced with reggae influences, as Nash had earlier collaborated with Bob Marley and his approach drew strongly from Marley's reggae style. ==Chart performance== After making modest chart advances for a month, the RIAA-certified gold single unexpectedly took only two weeks to vault from No. 20 to No. 5 to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on November 4, 1972, remaining atop this chart for four weeks, and also spent the same four weeks atop the adult contemporary chart.Whitburn, Joel (1996).

The music video for this version was directed by Academy Award nominated film director Scott Hamilton Kennedy. ===Critical reception=== Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, "Cliff manages to breathe freshness into this oft-covered pop nugget. His laid-back vocal is matched by a relatively faithful arrangement (except for the delicate reggae flavors). Already amassing praise at adult formats, track is a good bet for eventual top 40 success." ===Charts=== ====Weekly charts==== Chart (1993–1994) Peak position Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 18 Europe (European AC Radio) 11 Europe (European Dance Radio) 18 Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40) 1 ====Year-end charts==== Chart (1994) Position Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 81 France (SNEP) 11 Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40) 7 New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) 14 US Billboard Hot 100 66 ===Sales and certifications=== ==Other notable covers== *A version by Ray Charles was included on his 1977 album True to Life and in 2021 on the compilation box set True Genius. *Irish band Hothouse Flowers released their version as the second single from their album Home in 1990.

54904335	I Can Tell You About Pain	"I Can Tell You About Pain" is a single by American metalcore band Converge. It was released on July 25, 2017, as a 7-inch vinyl record via Epitaph and Deathwish, Inc., with the much longer track "Eve" as a B-side. The music video for the song "I Can Tell You About Pain" was directed by Tony Wolski. ==Music and critical reception== Consequence of Sound's Randall Colburn wrote: ""Eve" serves as a contrast to "I Can Tell You About Pain", as its seven-plus minutes incorporate group chants and menacing synths into its crashing guitars and pummeling percussion, giving the song an eerie epicness." Stereogum writer Tom Breihan described "Eve" as "a monstrous epic", and stated: "Both songs are punishing in very different ways." Pitchfork critic Saby Reyes-Kulkarni thought that "I Can Tell You About Pain"'s production style "almost leans in a black metal direction, giving the song a deceptively quick-and-dirty sound." Reyes-Kulkarni further stated: "This ability to switch from surgically precise to blunt and back again is what keeps Converge continually gripping." Andy Cush of Spin wrote: "The former ["I Can Tell You About Pain"] is quick and raw, finding the band in full-on firebreathing madness mode; the latter ["Eve"] is an unusually moody epic that clocks in at nearly eight minutes long." Graham Hartmann from Loudwire described "Eve" as "a more experimental piece of Converge's catalogue", stating: "Focusing on doom and drone characteristics, Converge stretch out the expansive track in a way that feels truly inspired. Kurt Ballou's production is top-notch, as always, building a colossal wall of sound for "Eve" that remains dense even in its softest moments." Treble Zine wrote that the former track is "an intense, rhythmically jerky noise-rock burner" while the latter "has some common traits with Oakland sludge innovators Neurosis, with whom the band is touring this summer." ===Accolades=== Publication Accolade Rank Loudwire 25 Best Metal Songs of 2017 SPIN The 25 Best Metal Songs of 2017 ==Track listing== All songs written by Converge. # "I Can Tell You About Pain" – 2:24 # "Eve" – 7:36 == Personnel == ;Converge * Jacob Bannon – vocals, lyrics * Kurt Ballou – guitars, vocals, keyboards, production * Nate Newton – bass * Ben Koller – drums, percussion ==References== ==External links== * Category:Converge (band) songs Category:Deathwish Inc. albums Category:2017 EPs Category:Albums produced by Kurt Ballou
54913568	I Believe in You (Dolly Parton album)	I Believe in You is the forty-sixth solo studio album and first children's album by American country music singer-songwriter Dolly Parton. It was released digitally on September 29, 2017, and physically on October 13, 2017, by Dolly Records and RCA Nashville. All proceeds from the album's sales will go to benefit Parton's Imagination Library. ==Background== The album was originally announced on July 5, 2014, with the release of the title track, "I Believe in You", as a free download on Parton's official website. The release stated, "All families who receive the gift of Imagination Library books were also presented with a free download of Parton's song, "I Believe in You", that she wrote for the Imagination Playhouse at Dollywood. Eleven additional songs will soon be made available for purchase, with 100 percent of sales supporting the longevity of the Dollywood Foundation." On October 18, 2016, Parton re- released her children's book, Coat of Many Colors, based on her hit song of the same name. This new version of the book featured new cover art and illustrations, as well as a free download of the song "Makin' Fun Ain't Funny". This version of the song features different instrumentation than the version featured on the album. On August 15, 2017, Parton formally announced the album's upcoming release at a press conference at her management's Nashville office in front of reporters and their children, saying "I love kids and I am so excited. It just seems like the right time [to release a children's album]. Since I'm getting so old, I'm getting back into my second childhood." She also revealed the album's cover and track listing, as well as singing three songs from the album and reading a story to the children. The album was made available for pre-order on September 15, 2017, along with the release of the album's title track, "I Believe in You". Following the album's release, Parton released animated lyric videos for all thirteen of the album's tracks via her Vevo channel on November 17, 2017. ==Critical reception== The album has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. James Christopher Monger of AllMusic felt that Parton's "effusive personality and seemingly ageless voice lend themselves well to the [children's] genre", that her "natural charisma and easy demeanor help keep things from becoming too cloying", and "with all proceeds from the album going to her bookworm charity, it's awfully hard to find fault with any of it." Elizabeth Andrews of The Spill Magazine judged Parton's first foray into children's music a successful one, and that the album "is a gift to share with parents, kids, the young at heart among us, and anyone needing a bit of a pick-me-up." Drowned in Sound however criticized the production of the album, saying it was "as counterfeit as much of Parton's idealised America has been throughout the years, and sounds like it was made on a Casio keyboard for the most part", nevertheless, "there's plenty for children to like about this album and it's hard to turn up the nose at the moral message which is at the core of the songs." ==Commercial performance== The album debuted at number 11 on the Billboard Kid Albums chart, and peaked at number 3 in its third week. It also peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart in its third week, with 4,800 copies sold. It has sold 25,500 copies in the United States as of April 2018. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from the album liner notes. *Robert Behar – wardrobe *Paul Brannon – guitars *Dennis Carney – cheek kisses photo *Sarah Chapman – original graphic design *Paul T.

55750028	I Can Only Imagine (film)	I Can Only Imagine is a 2018 American Christian biographical drama film directed by the Erwin Brothers and written by Alex Cramer, Jon Erwin, and Brent McCorkle, based on the story behind the group MercyMe's song of the same name, the best-selling Christian single of all time. The film stars J. Michael Finley as Bart Millard, the lead singer who wrote the song about his relationship with his father (Dennis Quaid). Madeline Carroll, Trace Adkins, Priscilla Shirer, and Cloris Leachman also star. I Can Only Imagine was released in the United States on March 16, 2018. It was a box office success, grossing $86 million worldwide against a production budget of $7 million, earning more than twelve times its budget. It is the fifth highest-grossing music biopic and sixth highest-grossing Christian film of all-time in the United States. Some critics praised it as inspiring and noted it as an improvement compared to other faith-based films, while others called it flat and by-the-numbers. At the 2018 Dove Awards, the film won "Inspirational Film of the Year". ==Plot== Ten-year-old Bart Millard lives with his mother and abusive father Arthur in Texas. One day, Bart's mother drops him off at a Christian camp, where Bart meets Shannon. Upon his return from camp, Bart finds that his mother has left and movers are removing her belongings. Bart angrily confronts Arthur, who denies that his abusiveness was the reason she left. Years later, in high school, Bart and Shannon are dating. Bart plays football to please Arthur, but is injured, breaking both ankles and ending his career. The only elective with openings is music class, so he reluctantly signs up. Initially, Bart is assigned to be a sound technician, but after overhearing him singing, the director casts him in the lead role in the school production of Oklahoma!. Bart overcomes his reluctance and gives an impressive performance, but does not tell Arthur, who finds out the night of the show when he happens to see a flyer for the show in a diner. Arthur suddenly collapses in pain, and finds out he has cancer, which he hides from Bart. The following morning, Bart antagonizes Arthur, who smashes a plate over his head. At church, Shannon sees the blood and presses Bart to open up, but he responds by breaking up with her, and leaves town to seek his fortune in the city. Bart joins a band in need of a singer, and convinces Christian music producer Scott Brickell to manage the band and secure a showcase in Nashville. Bart surprises Shannon and invites her to tour with the band, and is confused when Shannon flatly refuses. In Nashville, Brickell introduces Bart to established artists Amy Grant and Michael W. Smith, but is unable to convince record executives to sign the band, who do not believe the band, now performing as "MercyMe", is good enough. Devastated, Bart quits the band, but Brickell thinks that Bart needs to resolve issues in his personal life, so Bart reconciles with the band and asks them to wait for him, and leaves to return home. Bart returns home late at night, and is confused to find that Arthur has prepared breakfast for him the next morning. Arthur claims to have become a Christian, but Bart is skeptical and refuses to forgive him, and leaves. In anger and despair, Arthur smashes his old Jeep, which he had asked Bart to help him restore. Bart attempts to drive away in Arthur's pickup, but discovers the terminal cancer diagnosis, and returns to Arthur. Bart forgives his father, and the two form a deep bond, but Arthur soon dies of his illness. After Arthur's funeral, Bart rejoins the band and writes "I Can Only Imagine", and also calls Shannon and apologizes to her for the first time since their breakup. Brickell sends the demo tape to several artists, including Grant, who, deeply moved by the song, asks to record it herself as her next single, and Bart, who just wants the song to be heard, accepts. On stage, Grant begins the song, but can't bring herself to sing it, and calls Bart on stage from the audience to sing it himself. Bart's performance earns an enthusiastic ovation, and he reunites with Shannon, who was also in attendance. The band releases the song as their first single, achieving success on both Christian and mainstream radio. ==Cast== * J.

It is the fourth-highest grossing music biopic of all- time in the United States, behind Bohemian Rhapsody, Straight Outta Compton and Walk the Line. It is also the highest-grossing independent film of 2018. I Can Only Imagine was released on March 16, 2018, alongside Tomb Raider and Love, Simon, and was originally projected to gross $2–4 million from 1,620 theaters in its opening weekend.

The website's critical consensus reads, "I Can Only Imagines message will have the most impact among Christian audiences, but overall, its performances and storytelling represent a notable evolution in faith-based cinema." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 30 out of 100, based on eight critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of "A+" on an A+ to F scale. The Arizona Republics James Ward gave the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote, "Too often faith-based films — say anything with Kirk Cameron or the terrible God's Not Dead series — tend to preach to the choir or hector their audience. The Erwins’ films — I Can Only Imagine definitely among them — are more inclusive, charitable of spirit and hopeful, all qualities that are always appreciated, be they rooted in Christian faith or otherwise." David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a "C−" saying: "There’s a reason why all of these movies are so amateurishly made; why they all end with links to religious websites; why they all look like they were shot on an iPhone by a Walmart- brand Janusz Kaminski who lit each interior like the white light of heaven was streaming through every window...Art can be affirmation, but affirmation cannot be art." Faith-based reviewers mostly gave the movie positive reviews. Megan Basham of World magazine called Quaid "the real workhorse" and added that he "bears the heavy load of convincingly giving us both a monster and a repentant dad longing to connect with his son. Quaid impresses on both counts." Michael Foust of the Southern Baptist Texan gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and wrote, "The screenplay is gripping, the soundtrack is perfect, and the performances by Quaid and Finley had me squirming, laughing and crying." ===Home media=== The film was released on iTunes and Google Play on June 5, 2018, and on DVD and Blu-ray on June 12, 2018.June 5 Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Releases Comingsoon.net, Retrieved June 22, 2018.I Can Only Imagine Blu-ray Blu-ray.com, June 22, 2018 I Can Only Imagine was the no. 1 film in DVD sales and rentals for the weeks ending June 17 and June 24, 2018.‘I Can Only Imagine’ Earns Top Spot on Home Video Charts Media Play News, June 21, 2018 As of February 2020, I Can Only Imagine has earned $24 million in home media sales. ==Awards and nominations== Award Date of ceremony Category Recipients Result K-LOVE Fan Awards May 27, 2018 Film Impact I Can Only Imagine Dove Awards October 16, 2018 Inspirational Film of the Year I Can Only Imagine People's Choice Awards November 11, 2018 The Family Movie of 2018 I Can Only Imagine 27th Annual Movieguide Awards February 8, 2019 Best Movie For Families I Can Only Imagine Epiphany Prize for Most Inspiring Movie I Can Only Imagine Grace Award for Movies Dennis Quaid and J.

55788060	I Ask to Accuse Klava K. of My Death	I Ask to Accuse Klava K. of My Death () is a Soviet 1979 drama film directed by Nikolai Lebedev and Ernest Yasan based on the eponymous story by Mikhail Lvovsky. ==Plot== Regional center in the south of Russia. Young intellectuals Pavel and Rita Lavrov bring their four-year-old son Sergei to the kindergarten. He cries and does not want to stay here. Then the headmaster summons the pretty girl Klava Klimkova, who takes the boy to collect acorns. Sergei, with the help of his parents, collects more of them than other children; this causes the girl to experience affinity for him. Klimkova and Lavrov are in the third grade. He studies well, is active in sports and sings in the school choir. She on the other hand, can only beautifully hand out flowers, but Sergei solves all problems for the girl. He constantly makes Klava gifts — both things belonging to him, and taken from family members. Klava and Sergei are already in high school. He, as before, is the school's pride — winner of mathematical olympiads, chess champion of the school, athlete and simply a handsome man. Classmate Tanya Ishchenko is unrequitedly in love with him, and for Klava, Seryozha is merely a toy she is already sick of. The young man himself is not able to imagine life without his girlfriend. A promising new boy from the parallel class Lavrik attracts Klimkova's attention — son of a doctor, also an excellent student, who once even played a draw with Mikhail Tal. Sergei tries to regain the girl's attention, but more and more she shows a desire to break up with him. When the young man threatens to commit suicide, she declares that she would go with him anywhere, only if he was able to fulfill his declaration. With difficulty, Tanya and Lavrik manage to stop Lavrov. Klava, on the contrary, cruelly ridicules Sergei before his classmates. But her actions do not matter - the young man's eyes have become lifeless, and neither the correct words from others, nor a trip to the mountains with his parents can remove him from his depressed state. Upon Sergei's arrival from his hike, it turns out that Tanya's mother has died and the girl left school to make a living. The young man is shocked by this. He no longer sees Klava, but also can not forget her. Even when he wanders around the city with Tanya, he sees his beloved in girls passing by. Once Sergei and Klava meet at Lavrik's and then go for a walk, and the girl tries to apologize. After some time, Sergei awkwardly tries to profess his love to Tanya. Afterwards she leaves, and for a long time the boy gazes after her as she is walking away. ==Cast== *Maxim Yasan as Sergei Lavrov (as child) *Andrei Musatov as Sergei Lavrov (as third-grader) *Vladimir Shevelkov as Sergei Lavrov *Elena Hopshonosova as Klava (as child) *Olga Ozheretskovskaya as Klava (as third-grader) *Nadezhda Gorshkova as Klava Klimkova *Natalia Zhuravlyova as Tusya (Tatyana Ishchenko) *Vladimir Sidorov as Lavrik Korniliev *Lyubov Polishchuk as Vera Sergeevna, mother of Klava *Valentina Panina as Rita, mother of Sergei *Victor Kostetskiy as Pavel, father of Sergei *Anton Granat- Shurik as brother of Sergei *Veniamin Smekhov as Uncle Seva *Olga Volkova as Elena Grigorevna, a teacher in a kindergarten *Lyubov Malinovskaya as Neonila Nikolaevna, music teacher at the Palace of Pioneers *Alexander Anisimov as Dmitry Alexandrovich, Director of the Palace of Pioneers *Oleg Yefremov as director of the Palace of Pioneers *Lyubov Tishchenko as head of the kindergarten *Larisa Udovichenko as episode ==Awards== *Krupskaya State Prize of the RSFSR to Mikhail Lvovsky, Nikolay Lebedev, Ernest Yasan, Valery Mironov, Alexei Fedotov (1981). *The second prize "For the best film for children and youth" to the film at the 13th WCF (1980). *The main prize at the XVIII International Film Festival for Children and Youth in Gijón, Spain (1980). *Diploma of the jury at the 1st All-Union Review of the works of young cinematographers (1979). *The best film in 1979 for the recognition of the audience jury of the "Screen" club at the VI International Film Festival of Asian, African and Latin American countries in Tashkent (1980). *Mikhail Lvovsky's screenplay was recognized as the best at the closed professional competition of the Union of Cinematographers of the USSR (1979). ==References== ==External links== * Category:Lenfilm films Category:1970s high school films Category:1970s teen drama films Category:1970s teen romance films Category:Soviet drama films Category:1979 drama films Category:1979 films Category:Soviet teen films

562925	I Am Sitting in a Room	I am sitting in a room is a sound art piece composed in 1969 and one of composer Alvin Lucier's best known works. The piece features Lucier recording himself narrating a text, and then playing the tape recording back into the room, re-recording it. The new recording is then played back and re-recorded, and this process is repeated. Due to the room's particular size and geometry, certain frequencies of the recording are emphasized while others are attenuated. Eventually the words become unintelligible, replaced by the characteristic resonant frequencies of the room itself. In his book on the origins of minimalism, Edward Strickland wrote that "In its repetition and limited means, I am sitting in a room ranks with the finest achievements of Minimal tape music. Furthermore, in its ambient conversion of speech modules into drone frequencies, it unites the two principal structural components of Minimal music in general." ==History and performances== Lucier states that he was originally inspired to create I Am Sitting in a Room after a colleague mentioned attending a lecture at MIT in which Amar Bose described how he tested characteristics of the loudspeakers he was developing by feeding back audio into them that they had produced in the first place and then was picked up via microphones. The first recording of I am sitting in a room was made at the Electronic Music Studio at Brandeis University in 1969.Lucier, Alvin. I am sitting in a room. Lovely Music, Ltd., 1990. CD. The second recording was made in March 1970 in Lucier's apartment in Middletown. The first performance of the work was in 1970 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. In collaboration with his partner Mary Lucier, the performance featured projections of Polaroid images that had been degraded like the voice. A third, higher fidelity recording of I Am Sitting in a Room lasting over 40 minutes was released in 1981. Lucier performed the piece during the 2012 Venice Biennale Musica at the Teatro alle Tese, and a recording of this performance was commercially released on the 2016 album Alvin Lucier / Alter Ego: Two Circles. More recent performances include one at MIT's "Seeing/Sounding/Sensing" symposium in September 2014. In 2019, the full collaborative piece was performed for the first time in over 50 years as part of the New Ear Festival at the Fridman Gallery in New York. ==Full text== The text spoken by Lucier describes the process of the work, concluding with a reference to his own stuttering: ==Subsequent works== In 2010, YouTube user Patrick Liddell created an homage to I Am Sitting in a Room entitled VIDEO ROOM 1000, in which he uploaded a video of himself speaking text similar to Lucier's original to YouTube, then manually downloaded and re-uploaded it 1,000 times in sequence over the course of a year, in order to demonstrate the resulting digital artifacting of audio and video analogously to Lucier's original demonstration of analog artifacting of audio. In 2013, filmmakers Viola Rusche and Hauke Harder decided to use I Am Sitting in a Room as the "main structuring element" of the documentary "No Ideas but In Things" (2013). According to the filmmakers' notes, "the various process steps of the piece [I am sitting in a room] divide the film into chapters so that this work serves as an integral part of the film." In 2019, YouTuber MKBHD also created a similar video, titled This Is What Happens When You Re-Upload a YouTube Video 1000 Times repeating the same process with footage recorded from a Red Epic 8K Camera. ==See also== * Music on a Long Thin Wire: Lucier composition also based on resonance. * The Disintegration Loops ==References== Category:Minimalistic compositions Category:Process music pieces Category:Experimental music compositions Category:1969 compositions Category:Sound art albums
56295197	I Am Elizabeth Smart	I Am Elizabeth Smart is a 2017 American crime television film that aired on Lifetime that detailed the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart. The film features Elizabeth Smart as the narrator and stars Alana Boden, Skeet Ulrich, Deirdre Lovejoy, George Newbern, and Anne Openshaw. Smart's wraparound narration in the film was used to interrupt the events she endured, preventing the viewers from distancing themselves from the action. On January 14, 2018, a "Special Edition" of the TV movie was released, featuring interviews with Elizabeth Smart, Skeet Ulrich, and Deirdre Lovejoy. Smart watched the film once, and found the finished product so accurate that she did not want to watch it again. ==Plot== Elizabeth Smart recaps the time in which she was kidnapped and tells her perspective of it. It starts on June 5, 2002, with the kidnapping of 14-year old Elizabeth Smart (Alana Boden) in the middle of the night by a religious fanatic named Brian David Mitchell (Skeet Ulrich), who unknowingly wakes her sister Mary Katherine (Cassidy Nugent). In his hilly encampment, Mitchell and his wife Wanda Ileen Barzee (Deirdre Lovejoy) subjected her to bizarre religious rituals. On the first night, Mitchell forces Elizabeth to change clothes and proceeds to perform a ceremony in which they are “married”; that night, he rapes her. She later realizes that she had previously met Mitchell when he worked for her parents as a handyman. Mitchell rapes, starves, and drugs Elizabeth while claiming that his followers will kill her family if she doesn't do as he says. Mitchell treats her as his "second wife". In one of these rituals, he strips her naked and forces her to choose her “new name” from the Bible. Elizabeth's narration states that she chose the name Esther. Elizabeth later drinks alcohol when Mitchell threatens to have her go without food, water, or sleep. While Mitchell forbids Elizabeth from talking about her family, he does allow her to talk about her cousin Olivia. He leaves the encampment to claim Olivia and Elizabeth had prayed that Olivia would be safe. He returns, having been unable to kidnap Olivia, due to a "vision from God." After being absent for some days, Mitchell returns, and Barzee asks him to take her to the “parties” he goes to. Mitchell brings Barzee and Elizabeth with him to a party, and makes them wear full-length robes so Elizabeth won't be recognized. Two months after the kidnapping, Mitchell devises a plan to leave Salt Lake City with Elizabeth and Barzee, possibly to Boston or New York City. To research potential places to relocate, Mitchell and Barzee visit the Salt Lake City Public Library with Elizabeth, instructing her not to talk to anyone. There, they are noticed by a library patron because of their unusual dress, each wearing full-length robes with veils concealing most of their faces. A police detective arrives at the library and confronts them. However, Mitchell deters him by claiming that Elizabeth is his daughter and that they are unable to remove their veils or garb for religious reasons. He even prevents Barzee and Elizabeth from speaking, stating that their religion prohibits women from speaking in public. The three of them relocate to San Diego County, California. During one instance in Lakeside, California when Mitchell is absent, Elizabeth and Barzee are left in their desert camp without water for a week, before a freak rain storm occurs and saves their lives. Afterwards, Mitchell returns, bringing food and stating that he had been arrested for breaking into a church. He decides that they need to relocate again. Elizabeth manages to convince her captors that they should move back to Utah. Arriving in Sandy, Utah, the three hitch-hike for a while, until Elizabeth angers Mitchell by talking to a stranger. Elizabeth's narration states that this would be the last time that Brian would rape her. While in a store, Elizabeth notices some missing persons posters on the bulletin board. Mitchell tells her that she is not on the board, and that everyone has forgotten her. The moment they exit the store, however, the police converge on them. As Elizabeth is separated from them, Mitchell claims that he is a traveling minister. After some brief hesitation in front of a police officer who questions her on her identity, Elizabeth finally reveals who she is. As she is taken to the police station, the other police officers arrest Mitchell and Barzee. Later on, Elizabeth is reunited with her father Ed (George Newbern) and her mother Lois (Anne Openshaw). Later that night, Lois tells Elizabeth that the rest of the family are having a slumber party in their room. Elizabeth declines and states that she will sleep in her room. In Elizabeth's final narration, she states that she told her story to speak for kidnapping victims, including those who have not been found yet. She concludes by saying, "I am not cracked, I'm not shattered, I am Elizabeth Smart." A postscript reveals that Brian David Mitchell was sentenced to life in federal prison. Wanda Barzee was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Elizabeth got married and had children, and started the Elizabeth Smart Foundation with her father. ==Cast== * Elizabeth Smart as Herself * Alana Boden as Young Elizabeth Smart * Skeet Ulrich as Brian David Mitchell * Deirdre Lovejoy as Wanda Ileen Barzee * George Newbern as Ed Smart * Anne Openshaw as Lois Smart * Cassidy Nugent as Mary Katherine Smart * London Cardinal as William Smart * Ethan Farrell as Andrew Smart * Kiefer O'Reilly as Edward Smart Jr. * Sarah Madison Barrow as Olivia == Filming == Smart was heavily involved in the production and filming of the film; she also helped review the script to make sure the story was factual. She described it as being almost dreamlike at times, as some on-site locations were used to provide authenticity. In one case, Smart mentioned a time where she first saw Skeet Ulrich in costume for Mitchell, stating she was a bit taken aback by how much he resembled her abuser. There was a need to find balance in accurately depicting what happened to her in the film without alienating the audience, as Mitchell raped her daily, and Smart felt a need to tell the story without sugar-coating the kidnapping. ==Reception== Variety's Sonya Saraiya called it a startling and bold film, that while similar to the film Room, stands on its own. She added that the film does not diminish Smart's ordeal or add to it with manufactured drama, as Smart's experiences were horrible enough for the viewer. Others compared the film with the previous adaptation of Smart's story, The Elizabeth Smart Story, with many praising the new film for telling the complete story, and truly portraying what Smart endured. The film is described as feeling like a documentary, with reenactment scenes for the viewers. It was featured on Rolling Stone's 2017 list of “10 True Crime Shows to Watch this Fall”. ==References== ==External links== * I Am Elizabeth Smart at Internet Movie Database * Official website Category:2010s crime drama films Category:2017 films Category:2017 television films Category:Crime films based on actual events Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:Films about child abuse Category:Films about child abduction in the United States Category:Films set in the 2000s Category:Lifetime (TV network) films
56354913	I Can't Live a Dream	"I Can't Live a Dream" is a 1976 single by The Osmonds as the first track on their Brainstorm LP.. It was written by Arnold Capitanelli and first recorded by Frankie Valli in 1975 on his solo album Closeup. After The Osmonds charted a top-40 hit and easy listening chart-topper in 1975 with another Valli cover, "The Proud One," the quintet recorded "I Can't Live a Dream" as a follow-up. It was the lead single of two released from the album, and was the only one to chart. As was the case with most of the Osmonds' mid-1970s singles, only Merrill Osmond (by this point sporting a short-lived mustache to help distinguish himself from his brothers) sang lead vocals.

56885915	I Am Losing Weight	I Am Losing Weight () is a 2018 Russian sports comedy film directed by Aleksey Nuzhnyy. The film stars Aleksandra Bortich, Irina Gorbacheva, Yevgeny Kulik and Roman Kurtsyn. The premiere of the film in Russia took place on March 8, 2018, the gross for the first day of the rental amounted to 1.9 million dollars - as of mid-March this was the best achievement among Russian films of 2018, and for the first four days - up to 5.8 million dollars, which brought the film to the ninth place of the weekly ranking. ==Plot== The action takes place in Nizhny Novgorod. Anya Kulikova only loves food and her boyfriend - athlete Zhenya. But Zhenya is not pleased with Anya because she has put on a lot of weight and he decides to leave her. But Anya does not give up and sets a goal to get rid of excess weight. And Kolya Barabanov is there to help her, an overweight man obsessed with the healthy way of living. ==Cast== * Aleksandra Bortich as Anna "Anya" Kulikova * Irina Gorbacheva as Natalia "Natasha" * Yevgeny Kulik as Nikolai "Kolya" Barabanov * Roman Kurtsyn as Yevgeny "Zhenya ", coach for swimming * Yelena Valyushkina as Olga, Anya's mom * Mikhail Orlov as Semyon, friend of Olga * Sergey Shnurov as Sergey Kulikov, Anya's father * Anna Kotova as Diana, Sergey's wife * Alexander Ptashenchuk as Dimas, Natasha's husband, DJ * Valeria Dergileva as Christina * Andrey Trushin as fitness instructor * Oleg Kassin as Grisha, combine operator * Anna Ichetokina as laughing woman * Alena Ermolaeva as Alena ==Production== Aleksandra Bortich had to gain and lose 20 kg over the course of the making of the film. The authors of the film offered the main role to Irina Gorbacheva, but she did not wanted to gain weight. Producer Ilya Naishuller played a smoked guest at a party - for this, he spent the whole shooting day on the couch with a blurred look and a bong in his hands. Before starting work on the film, director Aleksey Nuzhnyy and screenwriter Nikolay Kulikov lost 28 and 20 kg, respectively. Work on the script went on for two and a half years. During this time, the authors interviewed a large number of girls and women who are concerned about the topic of losing weight, so that everything in the film is as truthful as possible. There were 17 draft scripts in total. ===Filming=== The filming period was divided into two blocks. In the first block - May and June 2017 - Aleksandra Bortich was shot in full. After that, there was a break when Aleksandra Bortich switched to strict nutrition and trained 7 days a week. For a month and a half she lost weight and filming resumed. Aleksandra Bortich herself performed many tricks in the film: she climbed from the balcony to the balcony on the eighth floor, jumped from the pier into the water at a temperature of less than 10 degrees, ran out of the burning bath in a burning sheet. ===Criticism=== According to film critic Anton Dolin (ru), despite the predictable plot, overkill with views of the city to pop music and the not very appropriate role of Sergey Shnurov, all the "shortcomings are fully paid for by the merits" of the film. == Release == The film was released in the Russian Federation by Universal Pictures International on March 8, 2018. ==Reception== The film received mostly positive reviews, acting of Bortich and the script received praise. === Box office === The fees for the first day of rental amounted to 110 million rubles - as of mid-March this is the best achievement among Russian films in 2018, and for the first four days - up to 331 million rubles ($5.8 million), which brought the film to the ninth place of the weekly world rating. By early August, total fees exceeded 630 million rubles ($10 million). ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010s sports comedy-drama films Category:2018 romantic comedy-drama films Category:Russian sports comedy-drama films Category:Body image in popular culture Category:2010s feminist films Category:Films about obesity Category:Films set in Nizhny Novgorod Category:Russian romantic comedy-drama films Category:2018 comedy films
57047807	I Can See It	"I Can See It" is a song by English synth-pop duo Blancmange, released in April 1986 as a non-album single. The song is a re-recorded version of "Why Don't They Leave Things Alone?", which appeared on the duo's third studio album Believe You Me (1985). It was written by Neil Arthur and Stephen Luscombe, and produced by Greg Walsh. "I Can See It" reached number 71 in the UK Singles Chart and remains the duo's last appearance in the chart. Shortly after the single's release, Blancmange decided to disband. "I Can See It" was recorded at Eel Pie Studios in London, while the B-side, "Scream Down the House", was recorded at the Strongroom, London. The song's music video was directed by Gerald Casale of new wave band Devo. ==Critical reception== On its release, Ian Cranna of Smash Hits described "Why Don't They Leave Things Alone?" as the "best song on the disappointing Believe You Me" and said that as "I Can See It", the song had been "reworked into an absolute cracker". He added, "Blancmange are fairly hit-and-miss, mostly due to their healthy madness being channelled into rhythms rather than tunes - but this has the best of both worlds." Betty Page of Record Mirror commented, "Gently persuasive, but needs a few concentrated listens before its charms become apparent. The Neil Arthur here is nothing like the Neil Arthur we used to know and lurve from 'Living on the Ceiling' days." Dave Ling of Number One felt the song was "stunningly average" and "hardly an obvious hit for Blancmange". He added, "This newie is quite an anonymous offering by comparison [to "Lose Your Love"]. In fact, without knowing who the artist was beforehand you'd be hard pushed to guess correctly." John Lee of the Huddersfield Daily Examiner described it as "fairly meritorious" but added that it "lacks the bite to change things for the better for this downward spiralling duo". Paul Benbow of the Reading Evening Post noted Walsh's "lavish production" but added that the "tedious vocals add up to hot air only used well to get a natty break from a trumpet". In a review of the 2017 deluxe edition of Believe You Me (1985), Paul Scott-Bates of Louder Than War described the original version as a "medium paced tune about the state of the World". He praised the single version as "arguably the band's finest single" and added that the extended version was "nothing short of superb". The Electricity Club commented that the song was one of the album's "finer moments", adding that "the use of cello and flute lends the finished piece a quiet quality". In a retrospective review of Believe You Me, Bill Cassel of AllMusic described it as the "loveliest, saddest ballad Blancmange ever recorded". ==Track listing== ;7" single # "I Can See It" – 4:07 # "Scream Down the House" – 4:08 ;12" single # "I Can See It (Extended)" – 7:58 # "Scream Down the House" – 4:08 ;12" single (UK promo) # "I Can See It (Bonus Beats)" – 10:15 # "Scream Down the House" – 4:08 ==Chart performance== Chart (1986) Peak position UK Singles Chart 71 ==Personnel== Blancmange * Neil Arthur – lead vocals, arranger on "I Can See It", producer of "Scream Down the House" * Stephen Luscombe – keyboards, synthesizers Additional personnel * Greg Walsh – producer and arranger of "I Can See It" * Brian Evans – engineer on "I Can See It" * Phil Bodger – engineer on "Scream Down the House" * Tony Bridge – mastering on "I Can See It" Other * Stylorouge – design * Mick Brownfield – illustration ==References== ==External links== * Category:1985 songs Category:1986 singles Category:Blancmange (band) songs Category:London Records singles Category:Songs written by Neil Arthur Category:Songs written by Stephen Luscombe

57301074	I Am Not an Easy Man	I Am Not an Easy Man () is a 2018 French romantic comedy film written and directed by Éléonore Pourriat. The film stars Vincent Elbaz as a chauvinist who ends up in a parallel universe where stereotypical gender roles are reversed. The film was released on 13 April 2018 on Netflix. It is the second French-language Netflix original film (after Blockbuster) and the first French-language film commissioned by Netflix. ==Synopsis== Damien is a shameless chauvinist who has all the benefits of living in a patriarchal society. After a bump to the head, Damien passes out. When he wakes up, he finds himself in what seems to be an alternate universe where gender roles are reversed and women have the power. Damien feels confused: now that he experiences sexism he struggles to find his place in this foreign new world. He meets and seduces Alexandra, an influential novelist who is herself a chauvinist. ==Cast== * Vincent Elbaz as Damien * Marie-Sophie Ferdane as Alexandra * Pierre Bénézit as Christophe * Blanche Gardin as Sybille * Céline Menville as Lolo * Christele Tual as Annie * Moon Dailly as Alexandra's coach * Camille Landru-Girardet as Ludovic ==Production== The film finds its origins in Oppressed Majority (), a 2010 short film directed by Pourriat, about a stay-at-home dad who experiences sexism in a parallel, female-dominated world, and eventually becomes the victim of sexual assault. In 2014, after being released on video-sharing platform YouTube with English-language subtitles, the short garnered international attention and Pourriat was approached by Netflix to develop a new, larger project based on the initial premise. Pourriat initially wanted to make a series, but she eventually reached an agreement with Netflix to produce a feature-length romantic comedy with the help of producers Eleonore Dailly and Edouard de Lachomette. The film premiered on Netflix on 13 April 2018. In accordance with French laws on digital film distribution, the film was not scheduled for theatrical release in France, in order to be immediately available online. Pierre Bénézit, the lead actor in Oppressed Majority, played the supporting character Christophe in I Am Not an Easy Man. ==Reception== Étienne Sorin of Le Figaro deplores an "uneven comedy" and conventional.Étienne Sorin.

57485875	I Am Damo Suzuki	"I Am Damo Suzuki" is a song by the English Post-punk band The Fall released on their 1985 album This Nation's Saving Grace . It was written in tribute to the Japanese expat vocalist Damo Suzuki of the Krautrock group Can,Johnson, Craig. "Damo Suzuki : HollyAris : I Am Damo Suzuki". Spiked, 1 February 2005. Retrieved 1 May 2022 whom Fall vocalist Mark E. Smith consistently described as a major influence.Ford (2002), p. 147Hanley (2014), p. 251 Smith's lyrics describe and evoke Suzuki's stage presence and singing style. The music was composed by guitarist Brix Smith and drummer Karl Burns. Described as spectral, the music is heavily influenced by the 1971 Can song "Oh Yeah", but also contains elements (especially the descending chords) of other Can tracks such as "Bel Air" (1973), "Gomorrah" (1974) and "Midnight Men" (1977). The song was described in 2022 as a "hypnotic art-rock anthem befitting of [Can's] name",Terich, Jeff."Beginner's Guide: The Best The Fall albums to start with". Treble Magazine, 23 March 2022. Retrieved 1 May 2022 while in 2019 Suzuki biographer Paul Woods wrote that "MES took the 'Oh Yeah' riff and overrode it with a speed-freak surrealist tribute to Can and Damo himself while throwing in an oblique reference to Fritz Leiber, one of a number of supernatural horror authors who also obsessed him." ==Music and lyrics== thumb|upright=1.0|Suzuki performing in 2008 The lyrics were written by Fall vocalist Mark E. Smith. They describe Suzuki's personality, stage presence and at times mimic his singing style. Smith had earlier said that Suzuki's surrealistic lyrics and tendency abandon language, and even have his vocals played backwards in the final mix (as on "Oh Yeah") was a major influence on his writing and delivery style. Smith's opening lyrics: "Generous of lyric / Jehovah's Witness / Stands in Cologne Marktplatz / drums come in / When the drums come in fast / Drums to shock, into brass evil", evoke both his admiration for the older singer and the aggressive style of Can's drummer Jaki Liebezeit.Norton; Stanley (2021), p. 42 Other lyrics such as "who is "Mr. Herr Stockhausen / Introduce me / I'm Damo Suzuki" indicate how listening to Can had broadened Smith's musical taste, while the word "What have you got in that paper bag? / Is it a dose of Vitamin C?" reference the Can song Vitamin C, while the carrying sack was later evoked in the 1988 Fall song "Carrier Bag Man" from The Frenz Experiment album. The band recorded two separate takes during the sessions for This Nation's Saving Grace, but Smith and producer John Leckie could not agree on which one to use. The vocalist preferred the band sound on the first take, and his vocal delivery on the second. As a solution Leckie spliced parts of the vocals from the second onto first. He said "the two takes had different arrangements, like the verse and chorus came in at different times, so the whole thing gives the impression of being completely random".Booklet from the Omnibus edition of This Nation's Saving Grace Because Smith was standing next to Burns during the recording of the vocals, there was inevitably sound leakage when the tapes were merged. According to Leckie, "the drums [were] coming through the vocal mix and every time the drums stop on the first take you can hear these ambient drums going on from the vocal mix on the second take and I thought it was fantastic and so did everyone else, but a totally unconventional way of doing it." The rhythm- heavy music was written by guitarist Brix Smith and drummer Karl Burns.Smith (2017)Irvin (2017), p. 495 The descending riff is based on the end section of "Bel Air" from the Can album Future Days, while Burns' drum pattern is based on "Oh Yeah" from Can's 1971 Tago Mago album.Middles, Mick. "The Fall: This Nation's Saving Grace Omnibus Edition – review". The Quietus, 26 January 2011. Retrieved 25 April 2022Andrews, Kernan. "Damo Suzuki - 21st cettury nomad". Galway Advertiser, 29 July 2010.Retrieved 1 May 2022 Brix said in 2017 that while it is one of her favourite songs she wrote for The Fall, "when I listen to it now I can hear my then technical weaknesses as a player, but in saying that I can also hear complete freedom and a certain creativity that might not have been captured had I played it perfectly". ==Reaction and influence== Fall bassist Steve Hanley said that he met Suzuki years later in a club, and that the singer had approached him with the words "I am Damo Suzuki", and after they had talked Hanley believed Suzuki "seemed pleased enough" with the song.Hanley (2014) Smith and Suzuki had become friends and met a few times by 1985. Suzuki used the song title for his 2019 biography "I am Damo Suzuki"."I Am Damo Suzuki biography to be published by Omnibus Press". The Wire, 2 January 2019. Retrieved 24 April 2022 In a 2010 interview, Suzuki said, "I know Mark E. He is Damo Suzuki as he is still singing this. I thought there is another Damo Suzuki in this world." Suzuki describes the song as the "ultimate namecheck" in his 2019 autobiography.Suzuki; Woods (2019), pp. 155–156 The American hip hop group Injury Reserve sampled parts of the song, mostly the keyboards, for their track "Ground Zero" which appears on their 2021 album By the Time I Get to Phoenix."Injury Reserve: Ground Zero".

A companion true-crime podcast, Root of Evil: The True Story of the Hodel Family and the Black Dahlia was released in February 2019. == Plot == Fauna Hodel, a young girl given up by her birth mother, sets out to uncover the secrets of her past and ends up following a sinister trail that swirls closer to a gynecologist involved in the legendary Black Dahlia slaying. == Cast == * Chris Pine as Jay Singletary, a disgraced LA-based journalist and Korean War veteran who encounters Fauna Hodel as he investigates her grandfather, George Hodel. * India Eisley as Fauna Hodel, who has grown up believing she's biracial but she begins investigating the truth about her biological mother and father. * Jefferson Mays as George Hodel, Fauna's grandfather, a prominent, powerful, and dangerous LA-based physician who was a suspect in the Black Dahlia murder. * Connie Nielsen as Corinna Hodel, George Hodel's now divorced second wife. * Leland Orser as Peter Sullivan, Jay Singletary's editor and mentor. * Yul Vazquez as Billis, a LAPD sergeant detective known for his brutal tactics. * Jay Paulson as Ohls, an LAPD detective and a Korean War vet who owes his life to Jay. * Golden Brooks as Jimmie Lee Greenwade, Fauna's adoptive mother who has kept Fauna's origins secret from her. * Theo Marshall as Detective Cuddy. * Jamie Anne Allman as Tamar Hodel, George Hodel's daughter and Fauna's birth mother. * Monique Green as Nina, Fauna's cousin. * Shoniqua Shandai as Tina, Fauna's cousin who warns her about investigating her white family. * Justin Cornwell as Terrence Shye, a friend of the Lee family who takes a romantic interest in Fauna. * Dylan Smith as Sepp, George Hodel's right-hand man. ==Episodes== == Production == === Development === On July 27, 2017, the US cable network TNT announced Chris Pine would play the role of Jay Singletary in a six-episode television drama, One Day She'll Darken, and serve as an executive producer alongside director Patty Jenkins and writer Sam Sheridan. The drama was inspired by the autobiography of Fauna Hodel titled One Day She'll Darken: The Mysterious Beginnings of Fauna Hodel. In late 2017, it was reported that Carl Franklin would direct two episodes and also serve as executive producer. Victoria Mahoney will also direct two episodes. Director of photography Matthew Jensen joined the project in November 2017. The series was renamed I Am the Night and while originally announced to premiere on January 28, 2019, a sneak peek full airing of the pilot would be scheduled to follow 25th Screen Actors Guild Awards on the night before. === Casting === On October 13, 2017, TNT announced that India Eisley, Jefferson Mays, Yul Vazquez, Justin Cornwell, Dylan Smith, Theo Marshall, Jay Paulson, and Golden Brooks had joined the cast.

On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". === Accolades === Award Date of ceremony Category Recipient(s) and nominee(s) Result Satellite Awards 2020 Best Actor in a Miniseries or TV Film Chris Pine Best Actress in a Miniseries or TV Film India Eisley == Notes == ==See also== *Root of Evil: The True Story of the Hodel Family and the Black Dahlia == References == == External links == * * Category:2010s American drama television miniseries Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:2019 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:TNT (American TV network) original programming Category:Television series about teenagers Category:Television shows based on books Category:Television series by Anonymous Content Category:Television series by Studio T Category:Television series set in the 1960s

5791967	I Couldn't Live Without Your Love	"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love" is a 1966 single written by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent and recorded by Petula Clark. It was inspired by the affair the songwriters were having at the time. Clark has cited "I Couldn't Live Without Your Love" along with "Don't Sleep in the Subway" as her favorites of her hits. “I still love that one; I do it onstage with great joy,” Clark told the "Montreal Gazette" in 2017. ==Background== The song was recorded at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch in a session which featured guitarist Big Jim Sullivan, along with vocal group the Breakaways, and was introduced by Clark on her BBC variety series, This Is Petula Clark. The single peaked at #6 on the UK Singles Chart and #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. "I Couldn't Live Without Your Love" was the first single by Clark to reach #1 on the US Easy Listening chart. A hit in Australia (#11), New Zealand (#18) and Rhodesia (#7), "I Couldn't Live Without Your Love" gave Clark a hit in Germany twice, first in the original English at #13 and then again via a translation entitled "So wunderbar verliebt zu sein" (So wonderful to be in love) (#28). ==Charts - Petula Clark version== Chart (1966) Peak position Australian Singles Chart 11 German Singles Chart 13 German Singles Chart *German version ("So wunderbar, verliebt zu sein") 28 New Zealand Singles Chart 18 UK Singles Chart 6 US Billboard Hot 100 9 US Billboard Easy Listening 1 ==Other versions== "I Couldn't Live Without Your Love" has also been recorded by Patti Brooks, John Davidson, Freda Payne, and Mari Wilson. The 1967 album release Pet Project by the Bob Florence Big Band features an instrumental version of "I Couldn't Live Without Your Love", the album being devoted to songs associated with Petula Clark. The Four King Cousins, a subgroup of the King Family Singers, featuring actress Tina Cole of "My Three Sons," performed the song on their 1969 ABC variety show. They still perform the tune decades later. In 1966 Donatella Moretti (it) had a single release: "Se un ragazzo pensa a te" which is an Italian rendering of "I Couldn't Live Without Your Love" while Swedish and Finnish renderings were single releases for respectively Siw Malmkvist ("Jag kunde aldrig glömma dej") and Monica Aspelund ("En Ilman Häntä Olla"); another Finnish rendering: "En Voi Elää Ilman Sua", was a 1992 single release for Mari Vesala (fi). The French rendering ""J'aimerais vieillir avec toi" was recorded by Dave for his 2004 album Doux Tam-Tam. The song was also recorded in 1976 by Jugular Vein, a UK jug band, on their album 'Waterloo Road' released on the Plastic Fantastic label, PFLR 3001. ==In media== *The song was used in adverts for Cesar dog food in the late 2000s. *In 2017, the song was used in an advert for Heathrow Airport, following the tale of 2 bears who met on a flight and how their relationship blossomed over the years. ==See also== *List of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1966 (U.S.) ==References== ==Bibliography== *The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 6th Edition, 1996, Billboard Books, Category:1966 singles Category:Petula Clark songs Category:Songs written by Tony Hatch Category:Songs written by Jackie Trent Category:Song recordings produced by Tony Hatch Category:1966 songs Category:Pye Records singles Category:Warner Records singles Category:Disques Vogue singles

57967927	I Can't Date Jesus	I Can’t Date Jesus: Love, Sex, Family, Race, and Other Reasons I’ve Put My Faith in Beyoncé is a 2018 collection of essays by Michael Arceneaux. Published by Atria Books, the collection includes seventeen essays, discussing Arceneaux's conflicting identities, his internalized homophobia, his journey as a writer, and his experiences dating. It also discusses his passion for the singer Beyoncé, who shares his hometown of Houston, Texas. Arceneaux was previously a Roman Catholic, and is a gay African-American. This is his first book. It was released on July 24, 2018. ==Development== According to Arceneaux, "I wanted to write about my life with a mix of pathos and humor—the same way a lot of white male authors like David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs get to write about their lives." In 2011 the writing process was complete, but Arceneaux did not publish it until 2018 because he needed an agent and publisher. Dystel, Goderich, & Bourret agent Jim McCarthy initially declined to represent Arceneaux but changed his mind after reading some of Arceneaux's essays. Rakesh Satyal of Altria became his editor; according to Arceneaux his supervision strengthened his book. Arceneaux had a conversation with his mother, who believed God opposes homosexuality, and his title is a reference to that conversation. She stated that since she knew he had sex with another man, she was not confident that he was going to go to heaven. He stated that the best response to a religious person who interprets his or her religion as being opposed to homosexuality is "I plan to have sex, so I can’t date Jesus." He first finished the book and then selected its title. ==Contents== Michelle Raji of the Texas Observer stated that the book's construction as a "series of explanations" is similar to those of self-help books, making it "a logical extension of the polemic, confessional style he’s perfected online" as well as being "accessible to a larger audience". One essay discusses how he does not have an admiration for whiteness because his parents deliberately took him to African-American healthcare personnel, he attended primary and secondary schools that had mostly African-American and Hispanic and Latino students, and he attended a historically black university. In "The Place Is No Sanctuary" he discusses homophobia in black-owned barbershops, which are for non-gay blacks places to socialize. In "I See A Priest in You" he received a suggestion that he become a priest, but Arceneaux decides not to do this. "You Will Die Poor" discusses his life as a low income resident of Los Angeles. "The First, the Worst" and "Learning How to Ho and Date and Failing at Both" discuss his romantic life. In Chapter 15 the author states his dislike of President Donald Trump and his administration, as well as Arceneaux's coming out to his mother. ==Reception== In Vogue, Chloe Schama and Bridget Read noted Arceneaux's "hysterically funny, vulnerable" style, calling the collection "a triumph of self-exploration, tinged with but not overburdened by his reckoning with our current political moment...The result is a piece of personal and cultural storytelling that is as fun as it is illuminating." Savas Abadsidis of The Advocate stated that the book's humor is similar to that of David Sedaris. According to Tre'vell Anderson of the Los Angeles Times, observers also compared the writing to that of Samantha Irby. Raji stated that the book "is an admirable attempt to reverse" a dynamic of mostly white-owned media stakeholders asking for racial ethnic minorities to "lead with his otherness, to write [one's] identity not just as a perspective but as a spectacle", and that I Can't Date Jesus has "a little more story and a little less spectacle." According to Raji, "the high-wire act between fun and serious does not land" in about half of the essays, including the romance-related ones, but that the "standout essay on sexual racism and interracial dating redeems these false starts." She also described the priest essay as a "standout". Publishers Weekly stated that the book's "confident voice and unapologetic sense of humor will appeal to fans of Roxane Gay." Kirkus Reviews described it as "A funny, fierce, and bold memoir in essays." ==See also== * History of the African Americans in Houston * LGBT culture in Houston * Christianity in Houston ==References== ==External links== * I Can't Date Jesus - Simon and Schuster Category:2018 non-fiction books Category:American essay collections Category:LGBT literature in the United States Category:English-language books Category:Atria Publishing Group books Category:African-American autobiographies Category:Gay non-fiction books Category:2010s LGBT literature Category:Books critical of Christianity

5814281	I Changed My Mind	"I Changed My Mind" is a song by American R&B; recording artist Keyshia Cole, recorded for her debut album, The Way It Is (2005). It was written by the singer along with John Legend and Kanye West, while production on the track was helmed by the latter. Released on November 9, 2004 as the lead single from the album, it was mildly successful commercially, peaking at number 71 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 23 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs charts. There was a remix to the song that featured rapper Shyne, who was incarcerated. This version made its way to radio airplay format, while the video version does not have Shyne in it. Vocals from Solomon Burke's "Get Out of My Life, Woman" are used throughout, although "I Changed My Mind" actually samples "The Chronic (Intro)" by Dr. Dre, in which Burke's sample is already embedded (Dr. Dre can be heard over the top of the sample saying "Yeah nigga..."). ==Background== Keyshia Cole wrote the song verse, John Legend wrote the bridge, and Kanye West wrote the vocals as well as produced it. The song also has background vocals by Legend. As are most of her songs, Keyshia wrote this about an ex- boyfriend. As her boyfriend has another girl on the side, he does not pay attention to Cole. She finds out about her, and "changes her mind", that she doesn't want to be with him anymore. She then goes on in the bridge, singing to him "I don't care if you come back to me on your knees, I just don't love you no more." ==Chart performance== "I Changed My Mind" debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 72, the highest debut of all Cole's singles. As a CD single release, it achieved "greatest retail gainer" status for two weeks. The song lingered in the bottom quarter of the Hot 100 for 2 months, eventually peaking at number 71. "I Changed My Mind" also peaked at number 23 on the US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs. ==Music video== The music video for "I Changed My Mind" was directed by Nzingha Stewart and filmed in Cole's hometown, Oakland, California on June 30, 2004. In the beginning, the video has various screenshots of different places in the Bay Area and has a resemblance of Mary J. Blige's 1993 Video of You Remind Me. In the video, Cole has a boyfriend whom she loves, but obviously finds out that he is cheating on her. She gets very upset and confronts him. She leaves him, and quickly moves on. The video features Kanye West and shows Shyne's promo CD "More or Less", He is featured on the Remix of this single. It was first seen as the "New Joint of the Week" on BET's 106 & Park on August 13, 2004. ==Promotion== Cole first performed "I Changed My Mind" during friend and producer Kanye West's set on Usher's Truth Tour (2004). ==Track listings== Notes * signifies an additional producer == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from the liner notes of The Way It Is. * Keyshia Cole – vocals, writer * Ron Fair – additional producer * Manny Halley – executive producer * Tal Herzberg – additional producer, engineer * Jun Ishizeki – engineer * Anthony Kilhoffer – engineer * John Legend – writer * Dave Pensado – mixing engineer *Kanye West – producer ==Charts== Chart (2004–2006) Peak position ==References== Category:2004 singles Category:Keyshia Cole songs Category:Kanye West songs Category:Song recordings produced by Kanye West Category:Songs written by John Legend Category:Songs written by Kanye West Category:Songs written by Keyshia Cole Category:2004 songs Category:A&M; Records singles

58413417	I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration	"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration" is an anonymous essay published by The New York Times on September 5, 2018. The author was described as a senior Trump administration official. About a week before the 2020 United States presidential election, Miles Taylor, who had been deputy chief of staff to the Department of Homeland Security's secretary Kirstjen Nielsen when writing the essay, revealed himself as the author. The op-ed criticizes Donald Trump and states that many current members of the administration deliberately undermine his suggestions and orders for the good of the country. It also states that some cabinet members in the early days of the administration discussed using the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as a way to remove the president from power. The New York Times editorial board said that it knew the author's identity but granted the person anonymity to protect him from reprisal. The publication of this editorial was unusual because few New York Times pieces have been anonymously written. Trump expressed outrage at the content of the editorial and called for an investigation to determine who authored the editorial. The author's identity drew much speculation in the media, with over thirty administration officials denying their involvement. On November 19, 2019, a little over a year after publishing the editorial, Taylor went on to publish the book A Warning, also anonymously. ==Political environment== The essay was published on September 5, 2018. During the week that the article was published, the book Fear: Trump in the White House by political author Bob Woodward was being promoted in the media ahead of its September 11, 2018, release date. Woodward's book depicts the Trump administration as being engulfed in chaos and internal opposition to Trump's impulses. The day before the essay's publication, the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary began public hearings on controversial US Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh. The timing was two months prior to the 2018 US elections and has been questioned as a possible calculated diversion, although The New York Times editorial board denied this. The essay praised US Senator John McCain, whose death occurred eleven days prior to the essay's publication. ==Contents== The author of the essay writes that they and many of their colleagues deliberately fail to follow some directives from the president when they feel the proposal would be bad for the country, "working diligently" to block his "worst inclinations". The author writes: "The root of the problem is the president's amorality. Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making." The author expresses support for a traditional Republican Party platform, particularly the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, while disagreeing strongly with the foreign policy of the Trump administration, and taking pride in colleagues' efforts to shift that policy in regard to Russia. The paper's editorial page editor summarized the column's perspective as that of "a conservative explaining why they felt that even if working for the Trump administration meant compromising some principles, it ultimately served the country if they could achieve some of the president's policy objectives while helping resist some of his worst impulses". The author disavowed any resemblance to the deep state conspiracy theory, saying: "This isn't the work of the so-called deep state. It's the work of the steady state." ==Identity of the author== There was much speculation about the identity of "Anonymous". The New York Times said that they were working with a single author, not a group of officials, and that the text was lightly edited by them but not for the purpose of obscuring the author's identity. They said that the definition of "senior administration official" was used in regular practice by journalists to describe "positions in the upper echelon of an administration, such as the one held by this writer". The newspaper's editorial page editor, op-ed editor, and publisher knew the identity of the author. Patrick Healy, the newspaper's politics editor, said that no identifying information had been leaked to The New York Times newsroom. The agreement between the newspaper's editorial department and the author did not prevent the newspaper's news department from investigating the identity of the author. According to James Dao, the paper's editorial page editor, the author was introduced to them by a trusted intermediary, and the author's identity was verified by background checking and direct communication. Dao said the use of a vaguely described anonymous identity was believed to be necessary to protect the author from reprisal, "and that concern has been borne out by the president's reaction to the essay". In response to a reader's question about whether the paper might have to reveal the author's name, Dao replied: "We intend to do everything in our power to protect the identity of the writer and have great confidence that the government cannot legally force us to reveal it." Several theories about who wrote the op-ed were offered. Some theories looked at which administration officials have a record of using certain words that appear in the essay. Specifically, the theories focused on the use of steady state, lodestar, and first principles. Some offshore bookmakers took bets on who the anonymous author was, with Vice President Mike Pence being the favorite at one site, while then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions led the field at another. More than thirty administration officials, including the actual author Miles Taylor, denied authoring the editorial: * Alexander Acosta, Secretary of Labor * Alex Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services * John R. Bolton, National Security Advisor * Ben Carson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development * Elaine Chao, Secretary of Transportation * Dan Coats, Director of National Intelligence * Kellyanne Conway, Presidential Counselor * Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education * Zachary Fuentes, deputy chief of staff * Nikki Haley, Ambassador to the United Nations * Gina Haspel, Director of the CIA * Kevin Hassett, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors * Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House Press Secretary * Jon Huntsman Jr., Ambassador to Russia * Larry Kudlow, Director of the National Economic Council * Robert Lighthizer, Trade Representative * Jim Mattis, Secretary of Defense * Don McGahn, White House Counsel * Linda McMahon, Administrator of the Small Business Administration * Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury * Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management and Budget * Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of Homeland Security * Ajit Pai, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission * Mike Pence, Vice President of the United States * Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture * Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy * Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State * Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Commerce * Jeff Sessions, Attorney General * Raj Shah, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary * Joseph Simons, Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission * Miles Taylor, chief of staff to former Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen * Melania Trump, First Lady of the United States * Andrew R. Wheeler, Acting Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency * Robert Wilkie, Secretary of Veterans Affairs * Christopher A. Wray, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation * Ryan Zinke, Secretary of the Interior US Senator Rand Paul suggested that the president force members of his administration to take polygraph examinations. Presidential advisers considered polygraph exams as well as requiring officials to sign sworn affidavits. Reports surfaced that the administration came up with a list of about a dozen people who are suspected to have authored the editorial. By September 7, Trump said that the US Department of Justice should open an investigation to determine who wrote the essay; however, the Justice Department would only be able to open an investigation if it is determined that the editorial publicized classified information in the United States. On October 28, 2020, Taylor came forward as "Anonymous". ==Reactions== thumb|thumbtime=06:22|start=06:22|Trump responds to the news of the anonymous essay. According to anonymous "aides and allies" quoted by NBC News, President Trump's private reaction to the anonymous op-ed was "volcanic". Via Twitter, he stated that the author was "failing" and "probably here for all the wrong reasons". He also questioned whether the aide was another "phony source" invented by the "failing New York Times", tweeting: "If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!" He later tweeted: "TREASON?" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the author a "coward" and said that they should resign. Some Democrats, including Robby Mook and Peter Daou, criticized the author for not doing enough to stop Trump. US Representative Jimmy Gomez commended the author for speaking out against the president but criticized them for maintaining anonymity, saying: "This is the problem with a lot of Republicans, including in the House: they privately say he's wrong, but they don't do anything about it." Former president Barack Obama warned that the op-ed should be viewed as a sign of "dangerous times" rather than as a source of comfort, criticizing the actions of the author as undemocratic. Georgetown University political scientist Elizabeth N. Saunders commented that while it is accurate that staff within administrations often push back on the sitting president's views and that staff leak things to the press, the extent to which senior advisers within the Trump administration push back against him is "essentially unprecedented". Cato Institute scholar Julian Sanchez questioned the author's motives, believing that the editorial would make Trump "even more paranoid" and cause capable staffers to be succeeded by "loyalist nuts and/or Trump family members". ==Followup book== On October 22, 2019, the anonymous author wrote a book about his experiences inside the White House; it was released on November 19, 2019, to mixed reviews. ==See also== * List of anonymously published works * The New York Times anonymous publications * Primary Colors, a political novel originally published anonymously ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 documents Category:2018 essays Category:2018 in American politics Category:September 2018 events in the United States Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Criticism of Donald Trump Category:Essays about politics Category:Media about the Trump presidency Category:Trump administration controversies Category:Works originally published in The New York Times Category:Works published anonymously

58468343	I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)	"I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" is a song by English band the 1975 from their third studio album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships (2018). The song was written by band members Matty Healy, George Daniel, Adam Hann and Ross MacDonald. Daniel and Healy handled the production alongside Jonathan Gilmore. Healy began the songwriting process at his home using an acoustic guitar, while the production was built around the song's opening guitar riff. Inspired to create a cinematic, gritty version of Aerosmith's "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing", the band worked with David Campbell, who conducts the string arrangements. "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" is an experimental Britpop power ballad with an electronic sound. The production comprises melancholic acoustic guitar strums, a cascading piano, shuffling drums, cinematic strings and elements of 1980s and 1990s adult contemporary rock. Lyrically, the song explores Healy's struggle with suicidal thoughts and details the desire for a different life and a return to the past. Thematically, the song reflects upon depression, isolation and loneliness. Upon release, "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Reviewers praised the production, lyrics and its placement on the album's tracklist, drawing numerous comparisons between the song and Oasis' "Champagne Supernova". It peaked at number 70 on the UK Singles Chart, number 16 in New Zealand, number 67 in Ireland and number 31 on the US Billboard Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart. == Background and development == The 1975 released their second studio album I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It in February 2016 to critical and commercial success. Domestically, it topped the UK Albums Chart and the Scottish Albums Chart. In the United States, the album peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200, Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts. The album received positive reviews and is considered by various publications as one of the best albums of 2016. In April 2017, the band announced their third studio album would be titled Music For Cars, set for release in 2018. In April 2018, posters promoting Music For Cars began emerging around London and Manchester. However, in May, Healy announced that Music For Cars would now represent an "era" composed of two studio albums. The first, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships (2018), was released in November of the same year and includes "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)". In an interview with Genius, Healy said that unlike most of the 1975's songs–which have "a lot more stylistic bigger kind of [songwriting] process"–he created "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" at his home using an acoustic guitar. Regarding the song's conception, the singer called it "quite a humble thing". The production began after they developed the opening guitar riff, which Healy said was instantly recognised by the band as something "really good", and based the instrumentation around it. While the song originally had a more traditional Britpop sound, he wanted to incorporate his love of "big American rock music"–specifically from the late-1990s and early-2000s–into the composition. Looking to emulate production elements from the two eras, Healy decided to add a large string arrangement to give the song an uplifting and cinematic quality. Healy contacted David Campbell, his roommate's father and the track's conductor, and asked him to compose the string arrangements. Speaking to Sam Sodomsky of Pitchfork, the singer said he strove to develop "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" as a midway point between the darkness of both the Verve's "Bitter Sweet Symphony" (1997) and the music of Oasis, while retaining the lyrics and vocals characteristic of Manchester. Ultimately, he was inspired to create a gritty, cinematic version of Aerosmith's "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" (1998). == Music and lyrics == Musically, "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" is an experimental Britpop power ballad that runs for a length of five minutes and 15 seconds (5:15). According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Music Publishing, "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" is set in the time signature of common time with a slow tempo of 74 beats per minute. The track is composed in the key of E major, with Healy's vocals ranging between the notes of B2 and A4. It follows a chord progression of E5–Emaj(no3)–E6(no3)–E5. The production of "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" contains a heavy electronic sound, composed of keyboards, cellos, violas, violins, synths, melancholic acoustic guitar strums, a cascading piano, shuffling drums, crashing drum fills and waves of canned, cinematic strings. It continuously builds, ending with a key change that signals a "blissful" transition to a minute-long "restless dream" of cellos and strings. The title mixes irony and honesty, meant to represent someone whose suicidal thoughts often come and go. Lyrically, "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" details Healy's struggles with suicidal thoughts and offers honest reasons why suicide is not the answer. The song's narrative describes living through the mundane, longing for the past and wanting a different life. It eschews the singer's preceding sarcasm and reflects upon themes of depression, isolation and loneliness. "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" begins with Healy singing: "I bet you thought your life would change / But you're sat on a train again". In the verses, the singer ruminates on his mortality and struggles with the difficulty that his death would have on others: "But your death it won't happen to you / It happens to your family and your friends". Later, he asks listeners to live by their own rules and be present in their joy. Healy's vocals are delivered in a gentle, whispered tone but shift to a strong falsetto in the chorus–which incorporates backing strings and elements from 1980s and 1990s adult contemporary rock–as the singer repeats the titular phrase. In the second verse, he sings in an inspired tone and reflects upon defiance in facing adversity, singing: "You win, you lose, you sing the blues / There's no point in buying concrete shoes, I refuse". As the song reaches its conclusion, Healy delivers one final plea in the middle-eight: "If you can't survive, just try". Eve Barlow of GQ wrote that "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" is reminiscent of Oasis' "Champagne Supernova" (1996), saying the song embodies the "moment we combust from indulgence, excessive stimuli, even anxiety". Kelsey Sullivan of Soundigest also drew similarities to the works of Oasis and wrote that the acoustic guitar and strings serve to highlight the fragility of the song's lyrics, comparing the latter instrument to the Verve's "Bitter Sweet Symphony", while saying it "would be easy to imagine this song used in a movie when a character is going through a difficult situation". Andrew Unterberger of Billboard said the song is evocative of a VH1 morning video block and the year 1998, calling it "the sound of Ethan Embry driving around while moping about his unrequited love for Jennifer Love Hewitt". He noted that unlike the 1975's "Give Yourself a Try" (2018), which contains searing guitars and a "choose-life" chorus, "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" indulges the listener's depression while ultimately encouraging them to persevere and "fight [their] way back out". Cory McConnell of The Ringer said the song embraces "titanic [1990s] Britpop", comparing it to a mix between Radiohead's The Bends (1995) and Sigur Rós' music. Will Richards of DIY deemed "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" a cacophonous, widescreen outcry, while Consequence of Sound writer David Sackllah compared the song to Oasis, calling it a "go-for-broke anthem" about suicidal thoughts. == Reception == Upon release, "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" was met with generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics and was heavily compared to Oasis' "Champagne Supernova". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph called the former a "dreamily epic" song. Ross Horton of musicOMH said "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" is "so huge and atmospheric that it might have been made by Sigur Rós on a rainy day". Dan Stubbs of NME called the song "massive" and praised its personal and intense qualities, saying they "might just leave you in tears". Sackllah wrote that "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" is "revealing, tragic and optimistic all at once". While deeming the track one of the album's three essential songs, he declared it a career highlight for the 1975 that reveals their true potential. Conrad Duncan of Under the Radar called the song a "festival-ready" anthem that "unbelievably justifies its ridiculous title". Unterberger called "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" one of the most interesting and special songs on A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships. He praised the band for exploring a period of gentle sorrow and subtle crisis, noting it would introduce new listeners to 1990s rock music while reflecting "what so many of their fans still feel like on a daily basis". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork deemed the track "the most life-affirming 1975 song to date", saying its "fist-pump theatrics" are reminiscent of Oasis. Tom Connick of NME said the couplet "But your death it won't happen to you / It happens to your family and your friends" is perhaps the most important line of 1975's career and said "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" deserves to be heard by anyone struggling themselves. The publication also declared the track the sixth-best song of the band's career, with TC saying it showcases their grandeur and ambition. He praised Healy's honest reflection in the lyrics, and deemed the song a masterpiece and lost classic comparable to Radiohead's The Bends and the Verve's Urban Hymns (1997). Micah Peters of The Ringer said "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" is an "extremely relatable death wish". Barlow called the song a "tear jerker", saying: "You can't listen to it without envisioning him doing it during headline festival slots. This is the encore." Sputnikmusic staff writer SowingSeason praised the sincerity and romance of "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)". Joe Goggins of Drowned in Sound praised the song's placement on A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships and its handling of mental health issues in the lyrics, saying Healy delivers an "admirably forthright reflection on depression". Sullivan praised the placement of "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" on the album and deemed it an emotional and honest masterpiece, calling the song soft, bleak, melodic and honest. Elaborating further, she said: "It is a beautiful, sad, and almost ominous way to end the album while capturing its essence." McConnell called the song a "jaw-dropping conclusion to an already bombastic album". He noted that while it is not as "sonically far removed" from I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It compared to the 1975's "I Like America & America Likes Me" (2018) and "TooTimeTooTimeTooTime" (2018), the song's use of Britpop feels unexpected. Isaac Feldberg of The Boston Globe called "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" a fitting end to the album, praising Healy's "gently devastating vocals". Claire Biddles of The Line of Best Fit said the song ends the album on a self-conscious, euphoric note. She commented that it functions as both a natural end-point and a high-concept track made for encores, calling the song a "final Britpop goodbye in the world’s dying embers, because we all want to go out to the sound of something familiar". Libby Cudmore of Paste gave "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" a mixed review, calling the song a "slow bummer". While she praised it for mostly managing to achieve a balance that the majority of I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It strives for and misses, she criticised the overproduced sound for creating a barrier between the listener and the singer. Chris Conaton of PopMatters felt the song is non-specific but praised Healy's falsetto and the string section's forward motion. Pryor Stroud of Slant Magazine gave "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" a negative review, calling it the equivalent of a half- finished sketch, "without a memorable melody in sight". Commercially, "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" performed modestly on international music charts. In the 1975's native United Kingdom, the song peaked at number 70 on the UK Singles Chart. Internationally, it reached number 67 in Ireland, number 16 in New Zealand and number 31 on the US Billboard Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart. == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships album liner notes. * Matthew Healy composer, producer, acoustic guitar, guitar, vocals, background vocals * George Daniel composer, producer, drums, keyboards, synthesizer * Adam Hann composer, guitar * Ross MacDonald composer, bass guitar * Jonathan Gilmore producer, recording engineer * David Campbell conductor, string arranger, piano * Derek Stein cello * Rudolph Stein cello * Luke Maurer viola * Thomas Lea viola * Mario de Leon violin * Michele Richards violin * Nina Evtuhov violin * Sara Parkins violin * Songa Lee violin * Travis Warner recording engineer * Robin Schmidt mastering engineer * Luke Gibbs assistant recording engineer * Nick Rives assistant recording engineer * Mike Crossey mixer == Charts == Chart performance for "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" Chart (2018–19) Peak position == See also == * The 1975 discography * List of songs by Matty Healy == References == == External links == * Category:2018 songs Category:The 1975 songs Category:Britpop songs Category:2010s ballads Category:Rock ballads Category:Songs about depression Category:Songs about suicide Category:Songs by Matty Healy

58742286	I Can't Stop (Gary Numan song)	"I Can't Stop" is a song by English musician Gary Numan, which was released in 1986 as the second single from his eighth studio album Strange Charm. It was written by Numan, and produced by Numan and the Waveteam. "I Can't Stop" reached No. 27 in the UK and remained on the charts for four weeks. ==Music video== A music video was filmed to promote the single. The nightclub performance footage was shot at Kadek TV (adjoining Shepperton Studios) and the footage of Numan flying his Harvard plane was filmed at Duxford Aerodrome. Speaking to Sound on Sound in 1986, Numan said: "The flying sequences were done with a minicam attached to the engine cowling of the plane and pointing into the cockpit. I had a trigger in one hand to start the camera shooting." ==Release== The first 15,000 copies of both the 7-inch and 12-inch formats came with a free flexi disc promoting Steve Braun and Hohokam, two of Numan's signings on his label Numa. ==Critical reception== On its release, Mark Jenkins of Sound on Sound considered the single to be Numan's "best for a long while". In a retrospective review of Strange Charm, Ned Raggett of AllMusic commented: "...even those cuts that derive all too clearly from the Berserker aesthetic, like 'Unknown and Hostile' and 'I Can't Stop,' come across as more unsettled and unexpected, making Strange Charm an imperfect but still noteworthy success." Speaking of Numan's 1989 live album The Skin Mechanic, Scott Kahn of MusicPlayers.com wrote in 2006: "Tracks like 'I Can't Stop' and '"New Anger' really came to life with Numan's live band compared to the studio tracks that were marred by rigid and heavily quantized drum beats." ==Track listing== 7-inch single #"I Can't Stop" - 3:23 #"Faces" - 4:42 12-inch single #"I Can't Stop (Extended Mix)" - 6:48 #"Faces" - 4:42 12-inch single (picture disc) #"I Can't Stop (Picture Mix)" - 5:50 #"Faces" - 4:42 12-inch single (UK promo) #"I Can't Stop (Special Club Mix)" - 6:32 ==Personnel== * Gary Numan - vocals, keyboards, instrumentation * Mark Railton - guitar * Mike Smith - keyboards * Linda Taylor, Rrussell Bell - backing vocals Production * Gary Numan - producer * The Waveteam - producers * Tim Summerhayes - engineer * Arun Chakraverty - mastering Other * Francis Drake - artwork ==Charts== Chart (1986) Peak position UK Singles Chart 27 ==References== Category:1986 songs Category:1986 singles Category:Gary Numan songs Category:Songs written by Gary Numan
58743957	I (Los Angeles Railway)	I was a streetcar route in Los Angeles, California. It was owned and operated by the Los Angeles Railway. ==History== The route was created from a former section of the West 1st and West 6th Street Line in 1919. It ran from 2nd and San Pedro to Alvarado and West 6th, mainly on West 1st Street. In the rerouting scheme of 1920, the route was shortened to 2nd and Broadway at the eastern end. It was given the letter designation I in 1921. Further rounds of truncation occurred between 1921 and 1932, usually related to road works. These left the outbound terminal at Bonnie Brae Street, where passengers could connect to a D car. Service ceased after November 1, 1939. ==Sources== ==External links== * I Line Archives — Pacific Electric Railway Historical Society * Category:Los Angeles Railway routes Category:Railway services introduced in 1919 Category:1919 establishments in California Category:1939 disestablishments in California

Although a bonus disc featuring Hybrid's live show at God's Global Gathering was intended to be included, it was omitted due to time constraints and may be released separately. Hybrid's track "Sleepwalking" was also originally intended for I Choose Noise, but was omitted because it was felt not to fit into the album. The track did not become available until four years after it was originally produced, with the release of the album Re_Mixed. I Choose Noise is the only studio album by Hybrid not to be released on vinyl. However, due to popular demand, several tracks from the album were also released on 12" vinyl singles. The three releases were "Dogstar", "Falling Down", and "Dream Stalker".

59327923	I Am Greater than I Was	I Am > I Was (pronounced "I am greater than I was") is the second studio album by rapper 21 Savage, released on December 21, 2018. I Am > I Was features vocals by J. Cole, City Girls, Offset, Post Malone, Gunna, Lil Baby, Schoolboy Q, Project Pat, Childish Gambino, and Savage's cousin Young Nudy. The deluxe edition was released three days later, featuring one more song, which features an additional guest appearance from Travis Scott. I Am > I Was was supported by two singles, "A Lot" and "Monster". The album received widespread acclaim from critics and performed well commercially, debuting atop the US Billboard 200 with 131,000 album-equivalent units, of which 18,000 were pure sales. It was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2020 Grammy Awards. ==Background== 21 Savage tweeted "12-7-18" in November, which led to speculation that the album would be released on that date. The tracklist was leaked by record producer Louis Bell via his Instagram story on December 13, 2018. 21 Savage later stated in his Instagram story that he was "sorry" because he "forgot" to release the album, but a later video stated it would be released on December 21. ==Cover art== 21 Savage posted the cover art on Instagram on December 6, which features a blurred out image of himself, captioning the image with a number of goat emojis. Billboard called the cover art "cryptic". ==Singles== The album's lead single, "A Lot", was released to rhythmic and urban contemporary radio on January 8, 2019. The album's second single, "Monster", was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio on May 7, 2019. ==Critical reception== I Am > I Was was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on six reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.2 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Reviewing the album for Variety, A. D. Amorosi stated: "Despite all the high-profile guests, it's actually on the soulfully inventive "Ball w/o You", "Gun Smoke" and the sensual "Out for the Night"—which all feature 21 Savage on his own—that "i am > i was" is at its best and most dynamic." Eric Diep of HipHopDX said, "At 15 songs and 51 minutes long, it's an enjoyable listen with good pacing, filled with the right amount of vulnerability, heartache, menace, and savagery". Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian saying "There is a slight uptick in vocal musicality compared with his previous work. ... He has plenty of average lines—almost as offensive as the rightly controversial "Jewish money" lyric in ASMR is the weakness of "you get burned like toast" as a simile—but his catchy flows always make him magnetic, especially when paired with universally brilliant production from Metro Boomin, Kid Hazel and others". Paul A. Thompson from Pitchfork stated, "i am > i was shatters the notion of 21 Savage as a specialist with a narrow purview and audience, and recasts him as a star in waiting, all without forcing him into unflattering contortions. It also cements him as a far more original stylist than other hopefuls from Atlanta". Consequence critic Michael Pementel said, "21 Savage's ability to express a variety of feelings allows the music to stand out at times and become more than a generic gangsta rap presentation. It's unfortunate, then, that the record finds itself held back by unfeeling and monotonous takes on issues like gun violence. Overall, i am > i was is a mixed bag of experience that offers enough solid tracks to keep fans latched on". ===Year-end lists=== Select year-end rankings of I Am > I Was Publication List Rank HipHopDX The Best Rap Albums of 2018 Uproxx The Best Albums of 2019 The Best Hip-Hop Albums of 2019 ===Industry awards=== Awards and nominations for I Am > I Was Year Ceremony Category Result 2020 Grammy Awards Best Rap Album ==Commercial performance== I Am > I Was debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 in the first chart issue of 2019, earning 131,000 album-equivalent units (including 18,000 pure album sales) in its first week, becoming 21 Savage's first US number-one album.

5941575	I Believe in You (Je crois en toi)	"I Believe in You (Je crois en toi)" is a duet by Celine Dion and Il Divo, released as the third and last single from Dion's On ne change pas album (2005), and first and only from Il Divo's Ancora (2005). At first, on 23 January 2006 "I Believe in You" was released as a radio single in the United States. The commercial single was issued 1 May 2006 in France and Switzerland. It was also released as a radio single in Canada, in May 2006. ==Background and release== Luc Plamondon, with whom Dion worked in 1991 on her Dion chante Plamondon album, wrote French lyrics for the song. There was no music video made for the song. Dion and Il Divo promoted "I Believe in You" in various French television shows, performing it in late 2005. The single peaked at number 30 in France and number 35 in Switzerland. In the US, it reached number 31 on the US Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks. Surprisingly, nearly 3 years after its release the song peaked at number 8 on the Portuguese Singles Chart according to Billboard magazine. "I Believe in You" was featured on the official 2006 FIFA World Cup album, called Voices from the FIFA World Cup, which was released on 20 May 2006. Il Divo are not the first opera singers who have performed and recorded with Dion. She had previously collaborated with Luciano Pavarotti on "I Hate You Then I Love You" and Andrea Bocelli on "The Prayer." The latter has been also performed by Dion and Josh Groban. ==Critical reception== While reviewing Ancora, James Christopher Monger of AllMusic wrote: "They fawn over Celine Dion—who can barely contain her own affections..."Ancora Il Divo AllMusic Rob Theakston who reviewed Dion's On ne change pas on AllMusic, wrote that having the new songs, including the duet, was a "plus side" to the compilation.On ne change pas Celine Dion AllMusic ==Track listing and formats== *European CD single #"I Believe in You (Je crois en toi)" – 4:00 #"Hasta Mi Final" – 3:36 ==Versions== There are two released versions of the song, the difference is heard where the line "Someday I'll find you" is sung by a different member of Il Divo. On Dion's On ne change pas album the line is sung by Swiss tenor Urs Buhler, and on Il Divo's Ancora album the same line is sung by Spanish baritone Carlos Marín. This is due to them swapping lines, where the other line swapped is part of the harmony in Dion's verse (the second verse). A third version of the duet performed entirely in English (Dion's verse included) was also recorded, but never released. Il Divo performed this version in their concerts with tenor David Miller singing Dion's parts. ==Charts== Chart (2006–2008) Peak position Portugal Digital Songs (Billboard) 8 Quebec (ADISQ) 29 ==Release history== Region Date Format France 1 May 2006 CD Switzerland 12 May 2006 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Celine Dion songs Category:2006 singles Category:French-language songs Category:Vocal collaborations Category:Songs written by Jörgen Elofsson Category:Songs written by Per Magnusson Category:Songs written by David Kreuger Category:Songs with lyrics by Luc Plamondon

59758097	I Balzini	thumb|I Balzini Estate I Balzini D'Isanto is a wine estate in Italy, producing a Super Tuscan (wine), classified IGT (Indicazione Geografica Tipica), an official Italian classification designating the region of origin, rather than grape varieties or wine styles, allowing the use of foreign grape varieties to be added. The estates is owned by the D'Isanto family since 1980. The name "I Balzini" comes from the word "balze", the local name for the small terraces planted with vines. ==History== The estate is in village of Barberino Val d'Elsa in the heart of Tuscany on the borders of the provinces of Florence and Siena. Surrounded with many important historic sites such as the former castle of Semifonte, destroyed during the period of the Communes in Florence. The octagonal chapel, a scale copy of Brunelleschi's Florentine dome, still looms over the surrounding countryside today. In 1980, the property of I Balzini was purchased by Vincenzo D'Isanto. Although vines almost certainly already existed on the site, around 1980, Vincenzo D'Isanto planted the majority of the vineyard. ==Vineyard== The vineyard, 250 meters above sea-level, covers over 7 hectares and consists of the hills around the estate and 2 hectares in the neighbouring Barberino Val d'Elsa village. The grape variety are Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Mammolo. The soil is of sedimentary Pliocene origin, characterized by slit yellow sand layered with clay strata, and large amounts of marine fossils. The microclimate is characterized by considerable temperature swings between the day and the night, which increase during the harvest period. Harvest, based on traditional techniques and strict control of yields, is carried out by hand all through the year. The careful use of organic fertilizers, environmentally sustainable packaging and renewable energy allow the vines to reach an advanced age. == The Cellar == Grapes from each plot are fermented in separate vats in order to preserve the identity of the terroir on which the grapes have ripened. Upon completion of alcoholic fermentation, the wines are tasted before being drawn off to the fine wine vats. The wine is transferred by batches into barrels with a special “toasting” suited to the characteristics of the wine. Blending takes place after the first racking of the barrels. Then the ageing phase of the wine begins in the cellar, which takes between 18 and 20 months.. The wine is then left to rest in glass for at least a year to reach its maximum balance and expression of its best qualities. They are sold in the fourth year from harvesting. I Balzini Green Label, being a fresh and young product, is refined one year in stainless steel tanks at controlled temperature and sold one year after the harvesting. I Balzini Red Label is aged 24 months in old barriques and refined around 18 months in bottle. ==See also== *Tuscan wine *Italian wine *IGT ==References== ==External links== *https://www.ibalzini.it/ Category:Vineyards of Italy Category:Barberino Tavarnelle
5982397	I Can Hardly Wait	"I Can Hardly Wait" is a 1943 short subject directed by Jules White starring American slapstick comedy team The Three Stooges (Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard). It is the 73rd entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. ==Plot== The Stooges are defense workers at the Heedlock Airplane Corp., a pun on the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. In the opening scene, they enter an apartment and break into a safe, which turns out to be a refrigerator. With the food they find, they prepare a late night meal of a single slice of ham, an egg, bread and coffee. Moe and Larry share the food, and Curly gets the bone and the eggshell. While eating, Curly breaks his tooth while attempting to eat the ham bone, resulting in a major toothache. Moe suggests he simply gets some sleep, and in the morning the toothache will be gone. The boys situate themselves for bed in a three-tiered bunk bed. Curly naturally receives the top bunk and his ascent thereto is not without mishap: faces are stepped on, and an attempt to alleviate Curly's pain using a hot water bottle ends in a soaking for Moe. When Curly does finally fall asleep, we are introduced into his dreams where his persistent moaning and complaining about his toothache aggravate the other two into action. His fear of dentists leaves the Stooges to improvise their own brand of home dentistry techniques. These techniques include trying to extract the tooth with a fishing pole and line, tying the tooth to the doorknob and violently closing it, tying the tooth to a ceiling light fixture and jumping from a ladder, and lastly, a firecracker. As the dream sequence continues, Curly is taken by Moe to the dentist, Dr. Tug (Lew Davis). A terrified and belligerent Curly makes the check-up difficult. Exhausted from wrestling with Curly, Dr. Tug enters the adjoining office of his partner Dr. Yank (Bud Jamison) and asks him to complete the extraction. Meanwhile, Moe tries to placate Curly's fears by taking his place in the chair and simulating the procedure. Yank enters the office and—believing Moe to be the patient—knocks him out with ether in a rag and pulls his tooth, ignoring Curly's warnings. Yank hands the extracted tooth to Curly and, upon learning that Curly is the real patient, runs out of the room. Moe awakens and finds Curly holding the tooth. This understandably angers him to no end and he takes it out on Curly, who attempts to defend himself. This flailing action in the dream translates to similar action in his sleep, causing him to wake up and fall through the entire bunk bed, which collapses in a heap on top of his two sleeping compatriots. Enraged, Moe gives Curly a solid punch to the jaw. This dislodges the problem tooth and all is well. The boys fall asleep where they lie amongst the bed cushions and splintered wood. ==Production notes== "I Can Hardly Wait" was filmed on March 15–18, 1943."I Can Hardly Wait" at threestooges.net It is a remake of the 1928 Laurel and Hardy silent short film Leave 'Em Laughing. The film title is officially listed with quotation marks (as "I Can Hardly Wait"), as it represents a phrase Curly repeats throughout the film.Solomon, Jon. (2002) The Complete Three Stooges: The Official Filmography and Three Stooges Companion, p. 233; Comedy III Productions, Inc., The first two malapropistic lines of Curly’s song ("She was bred (bread) in Old Kentucky/But She's only a crumb up here") is also the name of the song the Stooges performed as “Nill, Null, and Void” in the film Loco Boy Makes Good. As "I Can Hardly Wait" was filmed during World War II, it contains references to wartime activities and propaganda, such as the Stooges working on fighter planes as defense workers and Moe’s reasoning for the dentist to have Curly’s broken tooth removed: “Listen, doc, we're defense workers. If you wanna cut down on absenteeism, yank this guy’s tooth! He won’t let us sleep, he’s sabotaging the war effort!” ==References== == External links == * * *"I Can Hardly Wait" at threestooges.net Category:1943 films Category:The Three Stooges films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Jules White Category:Films about dreams Category:1943 comedy films Category:Columbia Pictures short films Category:American comedy short films Category:1940s English-language films Category:1940s American films

5996173	I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)	"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)" is a song by the American duo Daryl Hall & John Oates. Written by Daryl Hall, John Oates and Sara Allen, the song was released as the second single from their tenth studio album, Private Eyes (1981). The song became the fourth number one hit single of their career on the Billboard Hot 100. It features Charles DeChant on saxophone. ==Composition== Daryl Hall sketched out the basic song one evening at a music studio in New York City, in 1981, after a recording session for the Private Eyes album. Hall started the Rock 1 setting on Roland CompuRhythm then began playing a bass line on a Korg organ, and sound engineer Neil Kernon recorded the result. Hall then came up with a guitar riff, which he and Oates worked on together. The next day, Hall, Oates and Sara Allen worked on the lyrics. Speaking about the meaning of the lyrics, John Oates has stated that while many listeners may assume the lyrics are about a relationship, in reality, the song, "is about the music business. That song is really about not being pushed around by big labels, managers, and agents and being told what to do, and being true to yourself creatively." This was done intentionally, he explained, to universalize the topic of the song into something everyone could relate to and ascribe personal meaning to in their own way. Naming "Maneater" as another example, he revealed that this was a common theme for the group's songs. ==Reception== Record World said that it "demonstrates the duo's versatility as pop craftsmen" and noted that there are many hooks. ==Personnel== *Daryl Hall – lead vocals and backing vocals, synthesizers, Roland CR-78 drum machine *John Oates – electric guitar, backing vocals *Charles DeChant – saxophone *John Siegler – bass ==Chart performance== The single debuted at number 59 on the Hot 100 the week of November 14, 1981 as the highest debut of the week and after eleven weeks, on January 30, 1982, it reached the top of the chart, staying there for a week. "I Can't Go for That" ended a 10-week run at the top of the Hot 100 by Olivia Newton-John's song, "Physical" (which had knocked out Hall & Oates' "Private Eyes" from the top spot). The song also went to number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart for one week in January 1982. Thanks to heavy airplay on urban contemporary radio stations, "I Can't Go for That" also topped the US R&B; chart, a rare feat for a white act. It was the only record to hit number one on both the Hot 100 and then-Hot Soul charts during all of 1982. The single was certified Gold by the RIAA for shipments of one million units on January 7, 1982. According to the Hall & Oates biography, Hall, upon learning that "I Can't Go for That" had gone to number one on the R&B; chart, wrote in his diary, "I'm the head soul brother in the U.S. Where to now?" It also peaked at number one on the Radio & Records CHR/Pop Airplay chart on December 18, 1981, staying at the top of the chart for six weeks and remaining on it for fifteen weeks, making it their biggest hit on the R&R; airplay chart. This single was also the first top 10 hit for the duo in the UK, peaking at number eight in the UK Singles Chart. It was certified Silver by the BPI on March 1, 1982 for shipments of 200,000 units. ===Weekly=== Chart (1981–1982) Peak position Australia (Kent Music Report) 13 Canada RPM Adult Contemporary 1 US Dance Club Songs (Billboard) 1 US Hot Soul Singles (Billboard) 1 US Radio & Records CHR/Pop Airplay Chart 1 ===Year-end=== Chart (1982) Rank Australia (Kent Music Report) 96 Canada Top Singles (RPM) 16 US Billboard Hot 100 15 ===All-time=== Chart (1958-2018) Position US Billboard Hot 100 265 ==Legacy== "I Can't Go for That" was voted number six on VH1's list of "The 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s." === Samples === The song has been sampled numerous times including in "Say No Go" by De La Soul, "Sunrise" by Simply Red, "The Final Hour" and "Take Me to Your Leader" by MF Doom (under the King Geedorah moniker), and "On Hold" by The xx. Anderson .Paak has stated that Dr Dre's "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang" was originally also going to sample the song. ===Influence on "Billie Jean"=== According to Daryl Hall, during the recording of "We Are the World", Michael Jackson approached him and admitted to lifting the bass line for "Billie Jean" from a Hall & Oates song, apparently referring to "I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)." Hall says that he told Jackson that he had lifted the bass line from another song himself, and that it was "something we all do." ==See also== *List of number-one dance hits (United States) *List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1982 ==References== ==External links== * Video on VH1 Classic website * Category:1981 singles Category:1981 songs Category:Hall & Oates songs Category:Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles Category:Cashbox number-one singles Category:Songs written by John Oates Category:Songs written by Daryl Hall Category:Songs written by Sara Allen Category:RCA Records singles

60154883	I Am Easy to Find (album)	I Am Easy to Find is the eighth studio album by American indie rock band The National, released on May 17, 2019, via 4AD. The follow-up to the band's 2017 album, Sleep Well Beast, it was supported by the lead single, "You Had Your Soul with You", and accompanied by a short film of the same name, directed by Mike Mills and starring Alicia Vikander. Vikander is also featured on the album cover. A trailer was released for the companion film along with the announcement of the album. A tour promoting the album began in June 2019. ==Background== The bulk of the album was recorded at Long Pond studio in Hudson Valley, New York. Parts were recorded in other cities, including Paris, Berlin, Dublin, Cincinnati, Austin, and Brooklyn. The album and film, while having influenced each other, were essentially made separately. A press release stated that the album "is not the soundtrack" for the film; the idea for the album itself came after the film was shot. The album features female vocalists including Lisa Hannigan, Sharon Van Etten, Mina Tindle, Gail Ann Dorsey, Kate Stables, and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus. == Critical reception == I Am Easy to Find was met with universal acclaim, receiving a score of 81 on Metacritic, the review aggregating site. Reviewing in his Substack-published "Consumer Guide" column, Robert Christgau said that "almost every track is open to substantive female input on a musical whole that feels consistently interactive and empathetic and also not so glum—even when you can’t pin down exact meanings, it makes love sound possible." More negative critics, such as The Observers Phil Mongredien, complained about the album's flatness and inaccessibility. ===Year-end rankings=== Year-end rankings for I Am Easy to Find Publication Accolade Rank The A.V.

The film was released on May 13, 2019 on the official YouTube page of the rock band the National. The short is shot in black and white and features Vikander playing a woman from birth to death. The film features a medley of songs from the album of the same name by the band the National; however, the songs in the film differ from those in the album as Mills was brought in early in production and given permission to alter the songs as he saw fit. As the two projects developed concurrently, the final songs ended up differing from one another. The title for both the short film and the album of the same name was chosen by Mills from a lyric in the song of the same name. The song was originally titled Washington before Mills insisted on altering it. ==Synopsis== Shot in black and white featuring 140 subtitles, the film is the biography of a woman from birth to death as she grows up, moves away from her family, falls in love, and creates a new family of her own. ==Production== After finishing his film 20th Century Women, Mike Mills reached out to the band the National as he was interested in directing a music video for their album Sleep Well Beast. Instead the band responded by sending him fragments from their upcoming album encouraging Mills to use them as he saw fit. Mills was acquainted with actress Alicia Vikander who had trained as a ballet dancer and who had told him she wanted an opportunity to use her dance skills on film. When Mills conceived of the idea of making a biographical film on one woman's life from birth to death played by one actress he decided to use Vikander as her dance skills would help her embody the different ranges of motion necessary to portray the character. The film was shot in 2018 over 5 days. ==Release== The movie premiered at a "Special Evening With the National" event at the Beacon Theatre in New York on April 22, 2019. A Q&A; about the film followed moderated by Julien Baker featuring Mike Mills and two members of the National, Bryce Dessner, and Matt Berninger. Following was an audience Q&A; along with the live premier of the whole album along with a few prior released songs. It was subsequently released on YouTube on May 13, 2019. A version with director's commentary as well as a version with commentary by Berninger and Carin Besser; his wife; was also released along with their Q&A; at The Beacon on the same day within the description of said video. ==References== == External links == * Category:2019 short films Category:2019 films Category:2010s musical films Category:Films directed by Mike Mills Category:2010s English-language films

60965881	I Can't Stop Me	"I Can't Stop Me" (stylized in all caps) is a song recorded by South Korean girl group Twice, for their second Korean-language studio album, Eyes Wide Open (2020). It was released on October 26, 2020, through JYP Entertainment and Republic Records, as the album's lead single. As the opening track of the album, the song was written by Park Jin-young and Shim Eun-ji. The song was also composed by Melanie Joy Fontana, Michel "Lindgren" Schulz, and A Wright. "I Can't Stop Me" is a synthwave and disco-infused pop song with '80s-influences and rich instrumental sound exuding a retro style. The track's lyrics describe the boundaries of the good and bad of intractable desires. The accompanying music video, directed by Lee Gi-baek, premiered simultaneously with the release of the single. Sporting a retro atmosphere, the colorful video depicts Twice performing non-stop choreography to the song in multiple settings. To promote "I Can't Stop Me", the group appeared and performed on several South Korean music programs including M! Countdown, Music Bank, and Show! Music Core. == Background and release == Twice released their ninth Korean-language EP More & More in June 2020. The EP was a commercial success in South Korea, selling over 550,000 copies and becoming the group's best- selling album. Following the success of More & More, JYP Entertainment announced that Twice would be releasing their second Korean studio album, Eyes Wide Open in October 2020, to commemorate the group's fifth anniversary. On October 11, the group shared the track-listing of Eyes Wide Open, where "I Can't Stop Me" was revealed to be the album opener. The song was written by A Wright, Park Jin-young, Melanie Joy Fontana, Shim Eun-ji, and its producer Michel "Lindgren" Schulz. It was engineered by Sehee Eom, Eunjung Park, and Hyejin Choi, while the latter was additionally responsible for mixing alongside Tony Maserati which took place at Mirrorball Studios, North Hollywood, California. David K Younghyun was credited with assisting throughout the mixing process. PERRIE provided backing vocals for the song, and mastering was handled by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound, Edgewater, New Jersey. "I Can't Stop Me" was released for digital download and streaming as the lead single from Eyes Wide Open on October 26, 2020, by JYP Entertainment and Republic Records. "I Can't Stop Me" was choreographed by Jonte' Moaning, who has worked with Beyoncé for Single Ladies, as well as Kiel Tutin and Leejung Lee, who previously collaborated for More & More. == Japanese and English versions == === English version === The English version of "I Can't Stop Me" was released on November 30, 2020, as a digital single. === Japanese version === Twice released fourth compilation album #Twice4, on March 16, 2022, which includes both Korean and Japanese-language versions of "I Can't Stop Me". The Japanese lyrics were written by Natsumi Watanabe. == Composition == "I Can't Stop Me" has been described as an '80s synthwave and pop song, with elements of disco. It is the group's first attempt at the retro-synth genre that has inspired the musical direction of their entire album. The song draws from European electronic and American synth-pop sound, supported by an arrangement of drum machines, "intoxicating" Latin beats, and "strong" instrumental sound. Lyrically, "I Can't Stop Me" talks about the conflict and duality of the good and bad of uncontrollable desires. Elaborating on the lyrics, member Dahyun stated, "It portrays the danger and anxiety that come from standing on the boundary between the good and bad. It also captures a provocative ambience that boldly crosses the line, which I feel that a lot of people will be surprised by seeing a new Twice that they've never seen before." She added that the track illustrates the group's "musical growth" the most amongst all tracks on the album. Justin Moran of Paper noted that the track is about "seduction and the ways we're constantly attracted to things we know we shouldn't want — things that are bad for us," through lines like, "I see the end, I know it's not right, I can't stop me, can't stop me." The song is composed in the key of A♯ minor, with a fast tempo of 150 beats per minute and runs for 3:25. ==Promotion and music video== In the lead-up to the release of "I Can't Stop Me", the group released photo and video teasers for the track, which served as a promotional tool for their return. An accompanying music video was uploaded to JYP Entertainment's YouTube channel on October 26, 2020. The video was directed by Lee Gi-baek of the production company Tiger- Cave Studio, who had previously worked with several Korean artists, including Got7, Beenzino and Zico, among others. Portrayed in retro, the visual features Twice performing "non-stop" choreography in a white subway station, a rainbow- colored canyon, and a large lotus flower, as they don color-coordinated looks. In one scene, the members are seated at a long table, facing their mirror images. Towards its conclusion, they are seen boarding a train wearing "high- fashion black-and-yellow" outfits similar to the plaid separates worn by Alicia Silverstone in the teen comedy film, Clueless (1995). Discussing the fashion styles used in the music video, Chaeyoung said, "We also wanted to showcase our new sides visually, such as our widely beloved suit outfits from our teasers. We have many other kinds of outfits in store, some of them are featured in the song's music video." Moran wrote that the video showcases "Twice's star power, as the girls dance — perfectly in-sync, of course — throughout different environments, both on earth and somewhere in space." A choreography version was released on November 1, 2020. Its dance was choreographed by Kiel Tutin and Jonte Moaning. After 77 days of release, the music video surpassed 200 million views on YouTube. Hours after the song and the album's release, on October 26, 2020, Twice held a live meeting called "Twice 'I Can't Stop Me' Special Live" on Naver's V app and YouTube, introducing songs from the album and communicating with their fans. To promote the song and Eyes Wide Open, the group appeared and performed on several South Korean music programs, starting with Mnet's M! Countdown on October 29, where they performed "I Can't Stop Me" and "Up No More". They also appeared on KBS2's Music Bank, MBC's Show!

61070	I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang	I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a 1932 American pre-Code crime-drama film directed by Mervyn LeRoy and starring Paul Muni as a wrongfully convicted man on a chain gang who escapes to Chicago. It was released on November 10, 1932. The film received positive reviews and three Academy Award nominations. The film was written by Howard J. Green and Brown Holmes from Robert Elliott Burns's 1932 autobiography of a similar name I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang! originally serialized in the True Detective magazine. The true life story was later the basis for the television movie The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) starring Val Kilmer. In 1991, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". ==Plot== American sergeant James Allen returns to civilian life after World War I. He has served with distinction, earning a medal from Allied governments for his bravery, but his war experience has made him restless. His mother and minister brother feel Allen should be grateful for a tedious office clerk job. When he announces that he wants to enter the construction industry and improve society as an engineer, his brother reacts with outrage, but his mother regretfully accepts his ambitions. He leaves home to find work, but unskilled labor is plentiful, and it is hard for him to find a job. Allen sinks slowly into poverty. In an unnamed Southern state (the events upon which the film was based took place in Georgia), Allen visits a diner with an acquaintance, who forces him at gunpoint to participate in a robbery. The police arrive and shoot and kill his friend. Allen panics and attempts to flee but is caught immediately. Allen is tried and sentenced to prison with hard labor. He is quickly exposed to the brutal conditions of life on a chain gang. The work is agonizing, and the guards are cruel and sadistically whip prisoners for poor performance. Allen makes friends among the gang members, most notably Bomber Wells, an older murderer and chain gang veteran. The two conspire to stage a breakout. While working on a railroad, Allen receives assistance from Sebastian T. Yale, a powerfully built Black prisoner who damages Allen's shackles by hammering them with Allen's ankles still inside. The following Monday, while on a bathroom break, Allen slips out of his chains and runs. Armed guards and bloodhounds give chase, but Allen evades them by changing clothes and hiding at the bottom of a river. He makes it to a nearby town, where he is given money for a train ticket and a room for the night by one of Bomber's friends. Allen makes his way to Chicago, where he obtains a job as a manual laborer and uses his knowledge of engineering and construction to rise to a position of importance within a construction company. Along the way, he becomes romantically involved with his landlady, Marie Woods. Allen grows to loathe Marie, but she discovers his secret and blackmails him into an unhappy marriage. Trying to forget his troubles, he attends a high-society party at the invitation of his superiors and meets and falls in love with a younger woman named Helen. Marie betrays him to the authorities when he asks for a divorce. Allen describes the inhumane conditions of the chain gangs to the press, becoming national news. Many common citizens express their disgust with the chain gangs and their sympathy for a reformed man like Allen, while editorials written by Southerners describe his continued freedom as a violation of "state's rights." The governor of Illinois refuses to release Allen to the custody of the Southern state. Its officials offer Allen a deal: return voluntarily and receive a pardon after 90 days of easy clerical labor. Allen accepts, only to find the proposals were a ruse; he is sent to a chain gang, where he languishes for another year after being denied a pardon. Reunited with Bomber, Allen decides to escape once more. The two steal a dump truck loaded with dynamite from a work site. While leaning out of his seat to taunt pursuing guards, Bomber gets shot. He takes some of the dynamite, lights it, and throws it at a police car, causing a minor landslide. Shortly afterward, Bomber falls from the truck and dies, causing Allen to stop the vehicle. Allen then uses more dynamite to blow up a bridge he just crossed, allowing him to make a close escape. Allen makes his way north again, evading a relentless manhunt. Months later, he visits Helen in Chicago to wish her a permanent goodbye. Tearfully, she asks, "Can't you tell me where you're going? Will you write? Do you need any money?" Allen repeatedly shakes his head as he backs away. Finally, Helen says, "But you must, Jim. How do you live?" Allen's face is barely visible in the surrounding gloom as he replies, "I steal," disappearing into the darkness. ==Cast== thumb|Paul Muni and Glenda Farrell in I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932) * Paul Muni as James Allen * Glenda Farrell as Marie * Helen Vinson as Helen * Noel Francis as Linda * Preston Foster as Pete * Allen Jenkins as Barney Sykes * Berton Churchill as the Judge * Edward Ellis as Bomber Wells * David Landau as the Warden * Hale Hamilton as Rev. Allen * Sally Blane as Alice * Louise Carter as Mrs. Allen * Jack LaRue as Ackerman (uncredited) * Walter Long as Blacksmith (uncredited) ==Development and production== The film was based on the book I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang! (1932) written by Robert Elliott Burns and published by Vanguard Press."A Fugitive From Georgia's Prison System; I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang. By Robert E. Burns. Introduction by the Rev. Vincent G. Burns 257 pp. New York: The Vanguard Press. . New York Times, January 31, 1932. (Retrieved April 28, 2017.) The book recounts Burns' service on a chain gang while imprisoned in Georgia in the 1920s, his subsequent escape and the furor that developed. The story was first published in January 1932, serialized in True Detective mysteries magazine. Despite Jack L. Warner's and Darryl F. Zanuck's personal interest in adapting Burns's book, the Warner Bros. story department voted against it with a report that concluded: "[T]his book might make a picture if we had no censorship, but all the strong and vivid points in the story are certain to be eliminated by the present censorship board." The story editor's reasons were mostly related to the story's violence and the uproar that was sure to explode in the Deep South. In the end, Warner and Zanuck had the final say and approved the project. Roy Del Ruth, the highest-paid director at Warner Bros., was assigned to direct, but he refused the assignment. In a lengthy memo to supervising producer Hal B. Wallis, Del Ruth explained his decision: "This subject is terribly heavy and morbid...there is not one moment of relief anywhere." Del Ruth further argued that the story "lacks box-office appeal," and that offering a depressing story to the public seemed ill-timed, given the harsh reality of the Great Depression outside the walls of the local neighborhood cinema. Mervyn LeRoy, who was at that time directing 42nd Street (released in 1933), dropped out of the shooting and left the reins to Lloyd Bacon. LeRoy cast Paul Muni in the role of James Allen after seeing him in a stage production of Counsellor at Law. Muni was not impressed with LeRoy upon first meeting him in the Warner Burbank office, but Muni and LeRoy became close friends. LeRoy was present at Muni's funeral in 1967 along with Muni's agent. To prepare for the role, Muni conducted several intensive meetings with Robert E. Burns in Burbank to learn how Burns walked and talked, in essence, to catch "the smell of fear." Muni stated to Burns: "I don't want to imitate you; I want to be you."Lawrence, Jerome. "Chapter 16" Actor, The Life and Times of Paul Muni. G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1982 Muni set the Warner Bros. research department on a quest to procure every available book and magazine article about the penal system. He also met with several California prison guards, even one who had worked on a Southern chain gang. Muni fancied the idea of meeting with a guard or warden still working in Georgia, but Warner studio executives quickly rejected his suggestion. The final lines in the film, "But you must, Jim. How do you live? I steal", are among the most famous closing lines in American film. Director Mervyn LeRoy later claimed that the idea for James' retreat into darkness came to him when a fuse blew on the set, but in fact it had been written into the script.O'Connor, John E. "Introduction: Warners Finds Its Social Conscience." I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang. Ed. John E. O'Connor University of Wisconsin Press, 2005 ==Box office== According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $650,000 domestically and $949,000 foreign, making it the studio's third-highest success of 1932-33 after Gold Diggers of 1933 and Forty Second Street. ==Critical reception== On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96%, based on reviews from 27 critics. Variety reviewer Abel Green wrote in November 1932 that it "is a picture with guts. It grips with its stark realism and packs lots of punch." And that "The finale is stark in its realism." The review said "Muni turns in a pip performance." Variety also included a "Miniature" and "The Woman's Angle" reviews. Frederick James Smith in Liberty in November 1932 gave the film the top score of 4 stars, "extraordinary". "Paul Muni is splendid as the chain-gang victim. All the other roles are well done, but they are incidental to Muni and to Mervyn Le Roy's tense, vigorous direction." The New Republic wrote in December 1932 it "is one of the finest to come from Hollywood in many a day. It tells with unflinching realism how chain-gang prisoners are treated and at the same time through its direction and acting it is raised far above the level of mere journalistic exposure. It will bring home the conditions among prisoners to millions of persons". Jeremiah Kipp of Slant Magazine wrote in 2005, "Th[e] soul-crushing horrors of slave labor in the penal system are neatly interwoven into a highly gripping plot." But Kipp thought, "It feels more like an uncompromising prison film than a message movie, so its frequent heavy- handedness seems more like unabashed pulp rather than sanctimony." Kim Newman wrote in 2006 for Empire, "The most powerful of Warner Brothers’ early 1930s ‘social problem’ films, this indictment of organised cruelty remains potent, hard-hitting melodrama." And he said it was a " no-holds-barred portrait of institutional bullying for such an early film." ==Impact on American society== The film is among the first examples of cinema used to garner sympathy for imprisoned convicts without divulging the actual crimes of the convicts. American audiences began to question the legitimacy of the U.S. legal system, and in January 1933, the film's protagonist Robert Elliott Burns, who was still imprisoned in New Jersey, and a number of other chain gang prisoners nationwide in the U.S., were able to appeal and were released. In January 1933, Georgia chain gang warden J. Harold Hardy, who was also made into a character in the film, sued the studio for one million dollars for displaying "vicious, brutal and false attacks" against him in the film. ==Awards and nominations== Academy Award Nominations: * Best Picture * Best Actor in a Leading Role – Paul Muni * Best Sound Recording – Nathan Levinson National Board of Review Award: * 1932 – Best Picture Other Wins: * 1991 – National Film Registry ==References== ==Further reading== * Introduction: Warners Finds Its Social Conscience; Screenplay * * * Chapter 11: "As Close to Real Life as Hollywood Ever Gets", Richard Maltby ==External links== * * * * * * I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang at TV Guide (1987 write-up was originally published in The Motion Picture Guide) * I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang at Virtual History * I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang essay by Daniel Eagan in America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry A&C; Black, 2010 , pages 198-200 Category:1932 films Category:1932 crime drama films Category:1930s prison films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American crime drama films Category:American prison drama films Category:1930s English-language films Category:Films about miscarriage of justice Category:Films about veterans Category:Films based on non-fiction books Category:Films directed by Mervyn LeRoy Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films set in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Films set in the 1920s Category:Films set in the 1930s Category:United States National Film Registry films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:1930s American films Category:Films scored by Bernhard Kaun
61076187	I Care a Lot	I Care a Lot is a 2020 American satirical black comedy thriller film written and directed by J Blakeson. The film stars Rosamund Pike, Peter Dinklage, Eiza González, Chris Messina, Macon Blair, Alicia Witt, and Damian Young, with Isiah Whitlock Jr. and Dianne Wiest. The film follows a lesbian con woman who makes a living as a court-appointed guardian, seizing and selling the assets of vulnerable elderly people, including the mother of a dangerous mafia boss. I Care a Lot had its world premiere at the 45th Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2020, and was released via streaming on February 19, 2021, through Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, depending on the region. The film received positive reviews from critics, with Pike winning Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical at the 78th Golden Globe Awards. ==Plot== Marla Grayson is a con artist who makes a living by convincing the justice system to grant her guardianship over elders who she pretends cannot take care of themselves. She places them in an assisted living facility, where they are sedated and lose contact with the outside world. She then sells off their homes and assets, pocketing the proceeds. She and the court deny a man, Mr. Feldstrom, access to his mother after he attempts to force his way into the assisted living facility. He later threatens her outside the courthouse, saying that he hopes she is killed. Dr. Karen Amos informs Marla about a potential case, a wealthy retiree with no apparent partner or close family named Jennifer Peterson. A judge appoints Marla guardian after she and Dr. Amos falsely testify that Jennifer suffers from dementia, confusion, and loss of mobility. Marla moves Jennifer into assisted living and immediately gets to work selling Jennifer's furniture, car, and home. While rooting through Jennifer's possessions, Marla discovers the key to a safe deposit box and finds that it contains a watch, gold bars, bank notes, and hidden, loose diamonds, which she takes and stashes away. As Marla's girlfriend and business partner, Fran, helps paint and renovate the house, a cab arrives driven by Alexi Ignatyev, who says he is there for a regular pick up of Jennifer. Fran says that Jennifer has moved. Alexi returns to his employer, Roman Lunyov, greatly distressed. Roman, a crime lord, is revealed to be Jennifer's son. He threatens Alexi and orders him to find his mother and report back. Mafia lawyer Dean Ericson offers to pay Marla $150,000 in cash to release Jennifer but she refuses, willing to do it only if she is paid $5 million. He threatens Marla and takes her to court. The judge dismisses the case as Ericson cannot prove Jennifer hired him. Fran discovers "Jennifer Peterson" is an identity stolen from an infant who died of polio. When Jennifer refuses to tell Marla her real identity, Marla teams up with property manager Sam Rice and withdraws filling many of Jennifer's basic needs. Finding his mother's safe deposit box rifled, Roman sends three thugs to Jennifer's facility to take her. This violent effort fails, and Marla helps police apprehend Alexi, who is one of the men. Fran's police contact tells them that Alexi is the sibling of two other mafia bosses who supposedly died in a fire. Having failed to rescue his mother, Roman has Dr. Amos killed at her office. After hearing this news, Marla and Fran move into an unsold property of a previous victim. Jennifer attacks Marla when she visits the facility and is moved to a psychiatric ward. Marla is kidnapped while Fran is attacked in their home. Marla is taken to Roman, where she demands $10 million to arrange Jennifer's release. He refuses, and his associates knock her out with chloroform and send her in a car into a lake. She escapes and returns home to find Fran beaten unconscious as gas fills the house. They narrowly escape an explosion and flee to another unsold property. Marla shows Fran the diamonds she has hidden there. She offers Fran a choice: they can use the diamonds to start a new life elsewhere, or they can get revenge. Marla and Fran track down Roman and kidnap him. They force drugs into his body, burn his car, and leave him on a forest trail. He will be discovered high on drugs and with no identification. Roman is discovered by a jogger, and is rescued. With no identity, Roman is designated a "John Doe" by a judge, who appoints Marla as Roman's legal guardian. Marla visits Roman and offers to release him and Jennifer from her guardianship for $10 million. Instead, Roman offers her a partnership in a global business based on her scam. She accepts and, using his money and connections, quickly becomes a powerful, extremely wealthy CEO. Roman is reunited with Jennifer, while Marla marries Fran. While leaving a TV interview, Marla is shot by Feldstrom. He says that his mother died alone in the assisted living facility because no one would let him see her. As Feldstrom is arrested, Fran cries out for help and Marla dies in her arms. ==Cast== ==Production== It was announced in May 2019 that Rosamund Pike had been cast to star in the film, which would be written and directed by J Blakeson. Peter Dinklage and Eiza González were added in June. In July 2019, Chris Messina and Dianne Wiest joined the cast, and filming began the same month. Scenes were shot in Dedham, Massachusetts, including at the Norfolk County Registry of Deeds. ==Release== The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2020. Shortly after, Netflix acquired distribution rights to the film in select countries and regions, including the United States, France, Germany, Latin America, South Africa, the Middle East, and India. Amazon Studios acquired the rights to release it on Amazon Prime Video in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom through Black Bear's international distributor STX. It was released on both services on February 19, 2021. Over its first weekend of release, the film was the most-watched on Netflix, then second-most in its sophomore frame. On April 20, 2021, Netflix revealed that the film had been watched by 56 million households. == Reception == === Critical response === Owen Glieberman, writing for Variety, praised writer and director J Blakeson, whom he compared to Alfred Hitchcock, stating that "when he finally gets around to staging an action sequence, it's a doozy [...] because he takes his time and has you hanging on every moment". For Empire, Terri White wrote that Blakeson "doesn't always remain in full control of the story and tone, [but] the ride is so wild and entertaining that it doesn't particularly matter", and gave the film four stars out of five. Slant Magazine's Chuck Bowen gave the film two stars and a half out of four, and wrote that "Blakeson means for us to champion Marla as a feminist icon for a while, though he deflates this potential moral idiocy with an ironic ending." Various critics praised Pike for her performance as con artist Marla Grayson. While the Associated Press said "Pike pulls something off that few else could as a protagonist," Entertainment Weekly wrote that she delivered her best performance as a villain since Gone Girl in 2014. Writing for Out, Mey Rude said that I Care a Lot was "almost a perfect lesbian movie", praising the "sinister glee" Pike brings to what "could've been an all-time great lesbian sex symbol" role and the "great chemistry" that she and Gonzalez have as the story "keeps escalating and twisting and turning". However, she strongly criticised the "undignified and blunt" ending. The New York Times said that the film was an "unexpectedly gripping thriller that seesaws between comedy and horror", praising it for being "cleverly written and wonderfully cast", and for its "ice-pick dialogue" and introduction of Peter Dinklage as Roman Lunyov. Conversely, Adam Graham of The Detroit News gave the film a "D" and said that I Care a Lot was a "misguided black comedy", as viewers didn't have a way to relate to the character of Marla Grayson. The Chicago Tribunes, Michael Phillips gave the film two stars and wrote that while "the acting's uniformly strong [...] the script is distressingly weak." Mae Abdulbaki from Screen Rant gave a mixed review, lauding the performances from the ensemble cast, but writing that "there is something completely missing from I Care a Lot that makes it a hard pill to swallow." ==References== ==External links== * Category:2020 films Category:2020 black comedy films Category:2020 LGBT- related films Category:2020 thriller films Category:2020s comedy thriller films Category:2020s satirical films Category:Amazon Studios films Category:American black comedy films Category:American comedy thriller films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American satirical films Category:Black Bear Pictures films Category:Criticism of capitalism Category:English-language Netflix original films Category:Films about con artists Category:Films about the Russian Mafia Category:Films directed by J Blakeson Category:Films set in Massachusetts Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:Films shot in Dedham, Massachusetts Category:Lesbian-related films Category:LGBT-related black comedy films Category:LGBT-related comedy thriller films Category:LGBT-related satirical films Category:2020s English- language films Category:2020s American films

61529442	I Corps Troops, Royal Engineers	I Corps Troops, Royal Engineers (I CTRE) was a battalion-sized unit of Royal Engineers (RE) attached to the British I Corps Headquarters in World War II. It served with the British Expeditionary Force in the Battle of France and Dunkirk evacuation, and later with 21st Army Group during the campaign in North West Europe 1944–45 from D Day until the German surrender at Lüneburg Heath. It later served in British Army of the Rhine. ==Precursor units== Following the Cardwell Reforms a mobilisation scheme began to appear in the Army List from December 1875. This assigned all Regular Army and Militia units serving in the UK to a theoretical order of battle of eight army corps. The only all-Regular corps, I Corps based at Colchester, had the following units of the Royal Engineers (RE) assigned as Corps Engineers:Army List, various dates.Spiers, pp. 59–60, Appendix 3.Kochanski, pp. 82–3. * A Troop at Aldershot (Pontoons) * Half of C Troop at Aldershot (Telegraphs)Lord & Watson, p 214. * 12th Company and field park at Chatham, Kent During 1876 12th Co was replaced by 31st Co. The 1875 plan was over-ambitious: there were not enough engineers for eight corps and no staff; although there was a post for a Colonel Commanding Royal Engineers with I Corps, the position remained vacant. The Childers Reforms of 1881 only provided for an overseas expeditionary force of one complete army corps, and the revised mobilisation plan of 1886 (codified in the subsequent Stanhope Memorandum of 1891) allowed for an expeditionary force of two army corps, each with a 'field battalion' of RE sappers. In 1887 1st Field Battalion supporting I Corps comprised 7th, 11th, 17th and 23rd Field Companies. The field battalions were shortlived: in 1898 the RE component of each corps was supposed to comprise a pontoon troop, a telegraph division, a balloon section, a field company, a field park and a railway company. The corps remained paper arrangements only, without assigned staff, and when the Second Boer War broke out in 1899 the formations and units assigned to I Corps (now based at Aldershot) proceeded overseas separately, and never concentrated in South Africa.Kochanski, pp. 182–3, 193, 239–48.Dunlop, Chapters 1 & 5, Appendices A & B.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 1–2. After the Boer War the Haldane Reforms of 1908 established an expeditionary force of six divisions with a detailed mobilisation scheme, so that every unit had a defined position in the order of battle and mobilisation was regularly practised. The divisions became permanent formations, but only I Corps among higher formations had the nucleus of a staff, which was provided from Aldershot Command.Dunlop. Chapter 13.Edmonds, pp. 6–7. ==World War I== When mobilisation began on 5 August 1914, the Chief Engineer (CE) of Aldershot Command, Temporary Brigadier-General S.R. Rice, was immediately appointed CE of I Corps and went with it to France. At this date the RE was responsible for the Army's Signal Service, and Major M.G.E. Bowman-Manifold also went as Assistant-Director of Signals for I Corps.Becke, pp. 131–6. As the British Expeditionary Force assembled in France, the following RE troops from Aldershot Command were assigned to I Corps:Edmonds, Appendix 10. * 'A' Signal Company (1st Corps Signal Company)Lord & Watson, p. 219. ** K, L, G and D Sections * No 2 Section, Line of Communications Printing Section * No 1 Bridging TrainWatson & Rinaldi, p. 6. I Corps served on the Western Front throughout the war. RE units were assigned to the corps as required for operations, but by 1916 each corps had two 'army troops' companies, one tunnelling company and one special works company. In September 1918 CE I Corps had the following units under command:Watson & Rinaldi, p. 22. * 133rd Army Troops Company * 135th Army Troops Company * 290th Army Troops Company * 560th (Hampshire) Army Troops Company * 170th Tunnelling Company * 3rd Australian Tunnelling Company At the Armistice on 11 November 1918 I Corps signals were organised as follows:Lord & Watson, p. 234. * 'A' Corps Signal Company ** No 5 (Motor) Airline Section ** No 85 (Motor) Airline Section ** K Cable Section ** AN Cable Section I Corps HQ and its CE staff were disbanded shortly after the Armistice, though 'A' Corps Signals continued in the new Royal Corps of Signals after 1922.Lord & Watson, p. 239. ==World War II== ===Mobilisation=== When I Corps Headquarters mobilised on the outbreak of war in September 1939 it was assigned the following units as I Corps Troops Royal Engineers (I CTRE) under Lieutenant-Colonel G.R. Pim as Commander Royal Engineers (CRE):Ellis, France and Flanders, Appendix I.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, p. 23.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 130. * 13 Corps Field Survey Company at Southampton from the Survey Battalion, RE (Regular Army)Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 150, 152. * 102 (London) Army Field Company at Bethnal Green (Supplementary Reserve)Watson & Rinaldi, p. 157. * 105 (West Lancashire) Corps Field Park Company at Liverpool (Supplementary Reserve) * 107 (North Riding) Army Field Company at Middlesbrough (Supplementary Reserve) * 221 (2nd London) Army Field Company at Chelsea from the London Division (Territorial Army)Watson & Rinaldi, p. 162. ===Battle of France=== I Corps embarked for France with the British Expeditionary Force and began taking over a section of the frontier defences on 3 October 1939.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter II. I CTRE spent the early weeks on tasks around Corps HQ in the Douai area. Then the engineers spent the Phoney War period working on defensive positions. I CTRE attached 221st Fd Co to 1st Division as an additional field company. Its role on the outbreak of hostilities, in conjunction with 1st Division's bridging section, was to open the road from Tournai to Brussels and maintain an important canal crossing.Edwards, pp. 154–5.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 10–13. When the German offensive in the west opened on 10 May 1940, the BEF advanced into Belgium in accordance with 'Plan D'. 221st Field Co found itself in the lead, advancing ahead of the scouting armoured cars.Edwards, p. 155.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 25–7.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter III. However, the German Army broke through the Ardennes to the east, forcing the BEF to withdraw again, and by 19 May the whole force was back across the Escaut and then went back to the so-called 'Canal Line'.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter IV.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter VIII. The engineers carried out as many bridge demolitions as possible to delay the German advance. 221st Field Co was tasked with destroying bridges along a 10 km stretch of the Brussels–Charleroi Canal to delay the German advance, then to prepare a 'stop line' on the La Bassée Canal.Edwards, p. 156.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 28–9. By 26 May the BEF was cut off and the decision was made to evacuate it through Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo).Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XI.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 34–5. I Corps acted as rearguard, the sappers blowing bridges and cratering roads to form a defensive perimeter. Because it was unable to fulfil its usual role of supplying maps, 13th Field Survey Company was sent with the Corps armoured car regiment, 12th Lancers, on 27 May to defend Veurne, where the Belgian commander insisted that he required no help. However, on 29 May the Belgian Army capitulated, leaving a wide gap in the perimeter along the Yser. This gap was filled by the 12th Lancers, a few French troops, and by 13th Field Survey Company and 101st Field Company of I CTRE. They succeeded in blowing all the Yser bridges except at Nieuwpoort, where the Germans already had a bridgehead despite the efforts of the Lancers and Survey Company. However, the enemy were prevented from exploiting this bridgehead.Pakenham- Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 38–9. The BEF fought to maintain the shrinking perimeter round Dunkirk while the evacuation went on each unit in turndestroying its vehicles and stores before boarding a variety of vessels. One party of 221st Fd Co was on the Queen of the Channel, which was bombed and sunk on 28 May: the passengers and crew were picked up and taken to England aboard the Dorrien Rose. Another party from the company arrived in England the following day on HMS Greyhound. The last troops of the BEF who could be rescued left on 4 June.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XIV.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XV.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 40–2. ===Home Defence=== After the evacuation, I Corps was reassembled in Northern Command, becoming responsible for both field forces and coast defence artillery on the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire coast. I CTRE was reformed, but 13 Field Survey Co transferred to Northern Command HQ and 221 Field Co returned to the London Division, being replaced by 213 (North Midland) Army Fd Co from 46th (North Staffordshire) CTRE. 277 Corps Field Park Co was also assigned for a while from December 1941. In July 1943 II Corps was disbanded and II CTRE merged with I CTRE. 102 and 107 Field Cos were sent to the Mediterranean Theatre and were replaced by 234 and 240 Fd Cos from II CTRE, while 19 Fd Co joined, having been converted from a field squadron. For the rest of the war I CTRE was organised as follows: * 19 Field Co – from 79th Armoured Division * 234 (Northumbrian) Field Co – from II CTREWatson & Rinaldi, pp. 134–5. * 240 (Lowland) Field Co – from II CTRE * 105 (West Lancashire) Field Park Co From now on, I Corps formed part of Second Army in 21st Army Group, training for the planned Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) in 1944.Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 2: 21 Army Group, 24 July 1943, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/238. Indeed, I Corps' staff had been studying the engineering problems of an opposed landing since December 1941.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 321. ===Normandy=== I Corps was an assault formation for D Day, attacking with 3rd Division at Sword Beach and 3rd Canadian Division at Juno Beach. While I CTRE under its CRE, Lt-Col R.W.F. Poole, was kept under the direct command of I Corps HQ, a platoon of 19th Field Co was attached to 3rd Canadian Division to assist with beach obstacle clearance once the landings had been made.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 335–7, 348.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 170–87. thumb|right|Transport crossing 'London Bridge' into the Orne bridgehead during Operation Goodwood. Having failed to seize Caen on D Day, I Corps was engaged in heavy fighting in the area for several weeks. I CTRE's most important role was to increase the bridge capacity across the River Orne and the Caen Canal into the bridgehead captured on D Day by 6th Airborne Division. By the beginning of July three pairs of bridges were in place: * A Class 40 Bailey Pontoon bridge ('York I') built over the locks at Ouistreham by 234 Fd Co and 7 Fd Co (of 6th Army Troops RE), and its continuation ('York II') over the Orne by the same companies * The bridges captured by the airborne forces on D Day, Pegasus and Ranville * Two Class 40 bridges to duplicate Pegasus and Ranville ('London I' and 'London II'), built on 10–11 June by 71 Fd Co and 263 Fd Co (of XII CTRE) Now these were to be supplemented by further work, for which task Poole also had at his disposal five field companies from 18th GHQ Troops, RE (74, 84, 91, 173 and 213) and two from 8th GHQ TRE (89 and 90): * Replacement bridges at Ouistreham Locks ('Tower I' by 19 Fd Co) and its continuation over the Orne ('Tower II' by 234 and 240 Fd Cos) * Strengthening Pegasus and Ranville to take Class 40 loads * A pair of Class 40 Bailey bridges ('Tay I' and 'Tay II') at Blainville-sur-Orne, upstream from Pegasus and Ranville, by 89 and 90 Fd Cos. This additional work had to be carried out in secret, so that five Class 40 routes would be available for VIII Corps' tanks to move into the Airborne bridgehead to launch Operation Goodwood on 18 July. Stores were brought up in advance and concealed, and the actual construction was carried out during the night of 17/18 July. The associated work involved a great deal of improvement to roads and tracks, and lifting of minefields that blocked the routes of advance, and the RE of the attacking divisions had to help out. Although 'Goodwood' failed to achieve a breakthrough, the engineering operations provided a firm base from which I Corps advanced eastwards once the breakout from Normandy was finally achieved in late August.Pakenham–Walsh, pp. 365-7.Ellis, Normandy, p. 335. By this time, First Canadian Army had been activated, and I Corps came under its command. ===Clearing the ports=== thumb|300px|right|Tanks, infantry and sappers advance during Operation Astonia First Canadian Army's next task was to liberate the Channel ports and make them available to supply 21st Army Group. The first of these were captured by I Corps: St Valery-en-Caux on 4 September and Le Havre, in Operation Astonia, 10–12 September. The initial attack at Le Havre was launched by 56th Brigade of 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, supported by 240 Fd Co of I CTRE and led by the AVREs of 42 Assault Regiment, RE. 'Astonia' was very much a sapper's operation: the port was heavily fortified, but despite setbacks the set-piece operation went well, the defences were overrun and the town captured in 48 hours.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 385–8.Ellis, Germany, pp. 6–7, 13–5. First Canadian Army then moved on to Antwerp: the city had quickly fallen to 21st Army Group's advanced elements, but there was a prolonged campaign to clear the approaches to the port, after which I Corps held the line of the River Maas for the winter.Ellis, Germany, pp. 69–70, 109–10, 125–7, 238. ===Germany=== In March 1945 21st Army Group stormed across the Rhine and advanced rapidly across Germany. I Corps' role was limited to liberating the Netherlands and securing the lines of communication for 21st Army Group. The German surrender at Lüneburg Heath on 4 May did not end the work for the sappers: for many months they were engaged in repair and restoration of essential services behind the armies and in the occupied zone of Germany. The CE of I Corps had a month to devise a method of clearing 130 wrecked bridges from the Weser to open it to river traffic.Ellis, Germany, pp. 337–42.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 519–21, 550–1. On 21 May 1945, I Corps was redesignated I Corps district, responsible for Rhine Province and Westphalia as part of British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). In 1946 BAOR built a major () semi-permanent bridge over the River Elbe at Artlenburg, partly as a training exercise. 105 Field Park Company took part, attached to 5th Division, and was responsible for collecting stores before site preparation began on 1 August 1946. The 30-span bridge (Bailey sections on timber trestles) was completed between 12 August and 16 September.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 549–50. I Corps was disbanded in 1947; its RE companies all appear to have been disbanded in 1945–6. ==Postwar== I (British) Corps was reactivated in BAOR in 1951, and its Corps CRE's HQ reformed as I CCRE at Bielefeld in 1958. In 1969 it replaced 11 Engineer Brigade as the command element for most GHQ RE units in BAOR until 1976 when 11 Engineer Bde was reformed. I (BR) Corps was disbanded in 1992.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 218. ==Commanders== Commanders of I Corps RE included: Chief Engineer (CE), I Corps: * Brig-Gen S.R. Rice, 5 August 1914 * Brig-Gen C. Godby, 11 April 1915 * Brig-Gen R.P. Lee, 14 September 1915 * Brig-Gen E.H.deV. Atkinson 18 May 1918 * Brig-Gen H.W. Gordon, 31 October 1917 Commanding Royal Engineer (CRE), I CTRE: * Lt-Col G.R.

61701847	I Am Woman (film)	I Am Woman is a 2019 Australian biographical film about singer Helen Reddy, directed and produced by Unjoo Moon, from a screenplay by Emma Jensen. Tilda Cobham-Hervey stars as Reddy alongside Evan Peters, as her manager husband Jeff Wald, and Danielle Macdonald as rock writer Lilian Roxon. == Plot == The film opens with Reddy, aged 24, arriving in New York in 1966 with her three- year-old daughter, a suitcase and just . Within five years she had become one of the biggest superstars of her time, with eight number one US singles, her own hour-long TV show and an icon of the 1970s feminist movement, which adopted her power anthem. The film follows her troubled relationships with Roxon, author of the influential Lillian Roxon's Rock Encyclopedia, and husband/manager Wald, who also managed such artists as Sylvester Stallone, Donna Summer, Deep Purple and Tiny Tim. == Cast == * Tilda Cobham-Hervey as Helen Reddy * Evan Peters as Jeff Wald * Danielle Macdonald as Lilian Roxon * Molly Broadstock as Traci ** Coco Greenstone as young Traci * Chris Parnell as Artie Mogull * Jordan Raskopoulos as George Sylvia * Matty Cardarople as Roy Meyer * Liam Douglas as Jordan * Chelsea Cullen as the singing voice of Helen Reddy == Production == Reddy lived in a care facility in LA before her death one month after the film's Australian release, and her family advised the filmmakers on the project. Moon said she felt great responsibility to Helen to ensure the story was told sensitively: "Before we locked the movie off, Producer Rosemary Blight (Goalpost Pictures) and I felt very strongly that we needed to show the movie to Helen and her family. We did a screening for Helen, her ex-husband Jeff Wald, and her two children. As a filmmaker, sitting in the cinema with Helen Reddy was, and it’s probably going to be, one of the hardest screenings I had to do for the film. I suddenly realised that this is her life and she was watching it through my eyes. During the screening, Helen sang along to her songs, and when she cried, it wasn’t because she was sad that we made the movie, she cried because she found the whole experience so touching, and I think really cathartic in a way." Screen Australia is the principal investor in the film, alongside Cowlick Entertainment, and arts body Create NSW, with further funding from the Goodship Women's Fund, which supports films with strong social change messaging. ==Release == The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 5 September 2019. It was shown at the 24th Busan International Film Festival in Busan, South Korea, in October 2019. The film was chosen to open the 10th annual Athena Film Festival at Barnard College of Columbia University in New York, which celebrates women, on 27 February 2020. It was reported on 31 March 2020 (before the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic was known) that I Am Woman was scheduled for release in Australia by Transmission Films, in North America through Aqute Media, and elsewhere by Metropolitan (France), Nos (Portugal), Inopia (Spain), Videovision (South Africa), Front Row (Middle East), Bliss Media (China), Scene & Sound (South Korea), Ale Kino+ (Poland), VTI (former Yugoslavia), Cineplex (Taiwan), Golden A Entertainment (Thailand) and Cinesky (airlines). Premiere screenings were shown at cinemas around Adelaide (star Cobham-Hervey's home town) from 22 to 23 August 2020, presented by the Adelaide Film Festival. It streams throughout Australia on the Stan platform from 28 August 2020. ==Critical response== the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of . The site's critics consensus reads: "I Am Woman sticks disappointingly close to standard biopic formula, but Tilda Cobham-Hervey's performance keeps this affectionate, watchable tribute from falling flat." Indiewire declared the film “a cut above other genre entries”, while David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter described it as “entertaining and sharply packaged” with “considerable appeal”. He said of Cobham-Hervey's performance: "The crucial thing is that you really root for Helen — to make it in the first place and then to make it through a nightmarish marriage and come out unbroken. The luminous Cobham-Hervey has you in the corner of this smart, pragmatic, quietly driven woman all the way." Toronto movie review site That Shelf called it a “sure fire crowd pleaser”. Moon was awarded the Athena Breakthrough Award at the Athena Film Festival. ===Accolades=== Award Category Subject Result AACTA Awards (10th) Best Film Rosemary Blight AACTA Awards (10th) Best Film Unjoo Moon AACTA Awards (10th) Best Actress Tilda Cobham- Hervey AACTA Awards (10th) Best Editing Dany Cooper AACTA Awards (10th) Best Original Music Score Rafael May AACTA Awards (10th) Best Sound Robert Mackenzie AACTA Awards (10th) Best Sound Ben Osmo AACTA Awards (10th) Best Sound Pete Smith AACTA Awards (10th) Best Sound Tara Webb AACTA Awards (10th) Best Production Design Richie Dehne AACTA Awards (10th) Best Production Design Michael Turner AACTA Awards (10th) Best Costume Design Emily Seresin AACTA Awards (10th) Best Hair and Makeup Nikki Gooley AACTA Awards (10th) Best Hair and Makeup Cassie O’Brien AACTA Awards (10th) Best Hair and Makeup Wendy de Waal AACTA Awards (10th) Best Casting Nikki Barrett ==Soundtrack== A soundtrack was released by Goalpost and distributed by Sony Music Australia in August 2020.

61885542	I Can Spin a Rainbow	I Can Spin a Rainbow is a collaborative studio album by American singer- songwriter Amanda Palmer and English singer-songwriter Edward Ka-Spel of The Legendary Pink Dots. In a blog post on her official website, Palmer explained the backstory of how she was obsessed with the Pink Dots as a teenager, and even wrote and directed an experimental dialogue-free play inspired by their album Asylum when she was seventeen. When she was nineteen, the band needed a place to stay while on tour in Boston, Massachusetts and Palmer offered up her house. The Legendary Pink Dots also served as an opening act for Palmer's band the Dresden Dolls in the early 2000s. The two of them spent years trying to find a time to record an album together, but due to struggles in Palmer's personal life, plans always fell through. Most of the album was recorded in the house of English musician Imogen Heap. On May 19, 2017, Ka-Spel released a four-track studio album called High on Station Yellow Moon that features Palmer on three of the tracks. ==Critical reception== The album received a score of 60/100 based on reviews from nine critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews", making it Palmer's lowest rated album on the site. AllMusic summarized the album with "At best, I Can Spin a Rainbow feels like the work of two talented artists savoring a long weekend of boundless creativity together, but from an outsider's perspective, the results are a bit too impenetrable to contextualize without having been in the room to witness its genesis." Marc Hirsh's review for the Boston Globe echoed the inaccessibility of the album, saying "Every album she's ever had a hand in is, in one way or another, about creating a community. I Can Spin a Rainbow may be the first that goes about it by shutting people out instead of bringing them in." The A.V. Club called the album "tuneless" and "just about as 'for the fans' as it gets." Andrew Dorsett of PopMatters deemed the album "insufferable" and that it "sounds like an inside joke, an indulgence on a whim that few others share or can access." In contrast, Nina Keen of Drowned in Sound praised the album, saying "Each song tells its own story so intensely and so completely, like 11 musical horror novellas, that listening to any of them individually produces an experience more like that of listening to a shortish, intense, masterpiece- like album, especially as the songs often have a few different musical sections and ideas." ==Track listing== All songs written by Palmer and Ka-Spel ==Personnel== *Recorded at Hideaway Studio and Chez Dots, London in Summer 2016. *Mastered by Ray Steeg and Peter Van Vliet *Vocals and instruments: Amanda Palmer and Edward Ka-Spel *Violins: Patrick Q.

62081787	I Corps Band	I Corps Band or America's First Corps Band (officially referred to as the 56th Army Band) is an American military band maintained by the United States Army and is attached to the Army's I Corps in United States Army Forces Command. It is currently one of two Army bands in the Pacific Northwest, the other being the 133d Army Band (Washington Army National Guard) based at Camp Murray. The 56th is currently based at Joint Base Lewis–McChord outside of Tacoma, Washington. ==Ensembles== These ensembles include: *Brass Quintet *Woodwind Quintet *Jazz Combo *Rock Band *Brass Band *Concert Band *Ceremonial Band ==Performances== Outside ceremonial performances, the band also performs throughout the Tacoma community, which frequently include K-12 schools as well as community concerts and parades. A member of the band often performs at the regimental ball of the Military Police Corps in Tacoma, Washington. It also performs at the annual international band concert with the Naden Band of Maritime Forces Pacific and Navy Band Northwest at the Bremerton Performing Arts Center.

62187290	I Believe in Nashville	I Believe in Nashville (also, I Believe in Nashville Mural ) is a series of painted murals started in 2012 by the artist Adrien Saporiti, a Nashville native. The mural, which started in one location, has since been replicated on several walls throughout the city of Nashville. It has become a popular tourist destination and scene to pose for Instagram photos, having appeared on the photo-sharing platform over one million times. thumb|Photograph of the I Believe in Nashville Mural created by Adrien Saporiti in Nashville, Tennessee. ==History and creation== The first instance of the mural went up in the 12 South neighborhood of Nashville in March 2012. The piece is simple and described as "minimal... (with) three bold colors and four simple words." Part of the artwork's meaning is conveyed through its simplicity, which makes the message of Nashville pride very apparent while also drawing on the colors and tristar of the Tennessee State Flag. Prior to the creation of the mural, Nashville suffered historic flooding during the 2010 Tennessee floods. The mural has been described as a monument to the city's resilience in the aftermath of flood damage and its transformation into one of the "It Cities" of the United States. ===Vandalism=== Because of the mural's popularity, it has become a high-profile target for vandalism. The mural is known to have been vandalized at least three times. The first vandalization involved black tar being dumped on top of the mural in March 2017, shortly before the mural's fifth year anniversary. The second vandalization occurred just over four months later in July 2017. This time, a globe was painted over the center tristar, while the words "Global Warming" were painted over the word "Nashville," resulting in the mural saying "I Believe in Global Warming," in an apparent desire to draw attention to climate change. Three people were later charged for the defacement. The third instance of vandalism occurred in August 2018, where the word "Nashville" was changed to "rack," likely in reference to either the slang term of money or women's breasts since the vandalism was performed by a teenage boy. ===Locations=== Murals have a tradition of using their location and presence to send messages, often political, to passersby. While Saporiti claims he was not trying to send any sort of political message other "than to maybe bring people together," the mural locations are deliberately placed on brick buildings reminiscent of "old" Nashville in parts of the city that are undergoing rapid growth and transformation, such as 12 South or East Nashville. Three official versions of the mural have been created. The original is located on the Howell's Alley building at 2700 12th Ave. S., Nashville, TN 37204. Later versions, created by Saporiti's DCXV Industries, include a wider version at Marathon Music Works (1402 Clinton St., Nashville, TN 37203) and a smaller version at the music venue Basement East in East Nashville at 917 Woodland St., Nashville, TN 37206. The latter mural survived the Basement East's substantial destruction in the Tornado outbreak of March 2–3, 2020. ==Cultural influence== Because of the nature of murals as an art form being painted on buildings and walls, murals often can transcend their mediums and represent shared social beliefs. The mural has quickly become one of the most iconic symbols of Nashville. Its pop-culture references include the newspaper the Wall Street Journal, the magazine GQ, a music video from artist Hayden Panettiere, a Pepsi commercial, and the TV show American Pickers. Additionally, famous celebrities such as Brett Eldredge and Miranda Lambert have worn merchandise depicting the mural, which has spawned its own website and brand. The I Believe in Nashville mural is part of a greater trend of increasingly visible street art appearing in Nashville, which is often sponsored by businesses who see the murals as a way of branding their company or creating buzz around their space. The Mural has become one of Nashville's standout murals in a city where street art has become part of the culture. ===Reproductions and Philanthropic contributions=== The original version is sold on different hats, mugs, shirts, and other memorabilia by the I Believe in Nashville company. Because of its simplicity, the design of the mural lends itself not only to reproduction but to be changed and copied to fit different promotional causes. These changes typically occur through changing the color scheme, the symbol in the middle of the design, and the word along the bottom. An interpretation of the mural can be found on Bridgestone Arena building, home of the Nashville Predators hockey team called "I Believe in Smashville," which combines the overall layout of the original with the color scheme of the Nashville Predators. In 2020 a devastating tornado tore through Middle Tennessee. Affecting Nashville's 12 South area, the tornado caused severe damage to the murals The Basement East location, while the mural itself was left standing. Through the sale of "I Believe in Nashville" t-shirt proceeds, Richard Egan( Owner of IBIN brand) and Tim Gerst, were able to raise and donate over $1 millions dollars in disaster relief funds.wannado.com 3-12-2020 Artist Brantley Gilbert collaborated with the I Believe in Nashville team, to promote the sales of "I Believe in Heroism" t-shirts, meant to benefit James Shaw Jr., hero of the Nashville Waffle House shooting.Midwest Communications Inc., 4-26-2018, ""I Believe in Heroism": Brantley Gilbert to honor Waffle House hero at upcoming symphony show," Great Country 101.9 WDEZ, https://wdez.com/news/articles/2018/apr/26/i-believe-in-heroism-brantley- gilbert-to-honor-waffle-house-hero-at-upcoming-symphony-show/ An "I Believe in California" version was created and sold on t-shirts to benefit victims of the 2018 California wildfires. == References == Category:Public art in Tennessee Category:2012 paintings Category:Culture of Nashville, Tennessee Category:2012 establishments in Tennessee Category:Vandalized works of art in Tennessee Category:Murals in Tennessee

62457415	I Am Not a Dog on a Chain	I Am Not a Dog on a Chain is the thirteenth solo studio album by Morrissey, released through BMG on 20 March 2020. It is Morrissey's first album of original material since 2017's Low in High School. It was produced by Joe Chiccarelli, and lead single "Bobby, Don't You Think They Know?" features vocals from Thelma Houston. ==Recording and promotion== The album was produced by Joe Chiccarelli and recorded at Studio La Fabrique in Saint-Rémy-de- Provence, France, as well as Sunset Sound in Hollywood. In a press release, Morrissey called the album "the very best of me" and "too good to be true [...] too true to be considered good". Producer Joe Chiccarelli described it as Morrissey's "boldest and most adventurous album yet", claiming that he has "pushed the boundaries yet again – both musically and lyrically". ==Critical reception== I Am Not a Dog on a Chain currently holds a score of 62 out of 100 - indicating "generally favourable" reviews - on review aggregator Metacritic, based on 13 reviews. Josh Modell of The A.V. Club gave the album a B− and felt that the lyrical content was the weakest but that Morrissey displayed songcraft and "a great vocal performance". The editorial staff of AllMusic gave the album 3.5 out of five stars, with reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine summing up his review by calling the album "one of the better latter-day Morrissey records" but decrying how "placid and complacent he's been for the better part of a decade". Mina Tavakoli of Pitchfork rated the album 6.1 out of 10 and called it "frequently ridiculous, mildly captivating, and occasionally repetitive, pocked by moments of goofiness that come from the runoff of a man eager to chase old miseries and find new ones to berate". Writing for The Independent, Jake Cudsi rated the album two out of five stars, opining that it "has its moments, but they are brief and virtually lost amid the more experimental forays". Laura Snapes of The Guardian also gave the album two out of five stars, judging that Morrissey plays the "victim" and is "often lost among the strident music as he hectors people afraid to be themselves", though his "coyness undermines his apparent glee as a truth- teller".

62499310	I BIKE Dublin	I BIKE Dublin is an advocacy group founded in Dublin, Ireland in 2017 and is focused on improving conditions for cycling in Dublin city. The group carries out direct actions to raise awareness of the issues facing people who cycle in Dublin and to pressure the authorities to do more to provide safe conditions for cycling. The group's activities have included People Protected Bike Lanes, Die-ins and slow cycle protests. The first action took place on Andrew's Street, Dublin on 27 June 2017 and involved the protection of a contraflow cycle lane which was a black spot for illegal parking. The action immediately attracted media attention and a follow up action a week later made the main evening news on national television channel RTÉ. In December 2017, I BIKE Dublin coordinated a crowd sourcing of illegal parking on cycle lanes in Dublin in response to claims by the Garda Síochána that they were taking the issue seriously. More incidents of illegal parking were recorded in one week in Dublin than had been recorded by the Garda Síochána in an entire year, nationwide. In April 2018, following the death of a young man while cycling in Donnybrook, Dublin, I BIKE Dublin teamed up with other cycling groups and organisations to stage a die-in outside Dáil Éireann to highlight the dangers faced by people cycling in Dublin. In June 2019, the group presented its work at the Velo-city conference hosted by Dublin City Council. They presented Klaus Bondam, head of the Danish Cyclists' Federation, with a t-shirt in recognition of his outspoken criticism of the council and their lack of action in delivering safe cycling infrastructure. In October 2019, I BIKE Dublin teamed up with Extinction Rebellion to stage a slow cycle along the streets of Dublin as part of Extinction Rebellion's Week of Action. In November 2019 the group was invited to appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport to discuss the issues facing people who cycle in Dublin. In December 2019, I BIKE Dublin presented Irish author, Dervla Murphy with the inaugural Inspiring Cyclist of the Year award in recognition of her life's work as a touring cyclist and travel writer. ==See also== * Cycling Ireland ==References== Category:Organisations based in Dublin (city) Category:Transport in Dublin (city) Category:Public transport advocacy organizations Category:Cycling organizations Category:Cycling activism

63361771	I Cavalry Corps (Wehrmacht)	The I Cavalry Corps (), initially known simply as the Cavalry Corps (), or alternatively as Cavalry Corps Harteneck () after its commander, was an army corps of the German Wehrmacht during World War II. It was formed in 1944 and existed until 1945. == History == The Cavalry Corps was formed on 25 May 1944 in the General Government, using most of the personnel of the short-lived LXXVIII Army Corps. The corps was commanded throughout its lifetime by Gustav Harteneck, earning it the nickname Cavalry Corps Harteneck. The corps served at times under the 2nd Army, 4th Army, 6th Army and 2nd Panzer Army. Starting in June 1944, the Cavalry Corps was deployed on the Eastern Front against the Red Army. The corps, not yet fully deployed and operational, was thrown against the Soviet forces that advanced against the German lines as part of Operation Bagration, the Soviet offensive which brought about the collapse of the German Army Group Centre. After the end of Bagration, the Cavalry Corps fought at the Narew river and in East Prussia. The Cavalry Corps was known as I Cavalry Corps starting in February 1945. The I Cavalry Corps participated in the failed Operation Spring Awakening in March 1945, the last major German offensive during World War II. After the failure of Spring Awakening, the I Cavalry Corps staged a fighting retreat towards Austria. After German surrender on 8 May 1945, the corps, still largely intact, was taken prisoner by British Army forces and transported to Württemberg and Hesse.

Cash Box (October 10, 1964): "This Kent outing for Ike & Tina Turner is already stirring up a heap of attention. Tagged I Can’t Believe What You Say, it’s a high-speed handclapping twister that sports a host of ultra- commercial vocal and instrumental sounds. Watch it. Backing's a soul-filled shuflle-rock blueser that Tina wails with loads of feeling." == Cover versions == * 1965: Manfred Mann released a version as the B-side to "My Little Red Book" from their album My Little Red Book Of Winners * 1965: British singer Val McKenna released a rendition on Piccadilly Records in the UK * 1967: Danish rock group The Defenders released the song as a single on Sonet Records from their album Looking at You * 1972: Toots and The Maytals released a version on their album Funky Kingston * 2000: Henning Stærk released the song on his album Hit House == Chart performance == Chart (1964) Peak position US Billboard Hot 100 95 US Cash Box Looking Ahead 134 US Record World Top 40 R&B; 33 == References == Category:1964 songs Category:1964 singles Category:Ike & Tina Turner songs Category:Songs written by Ike Turner Category:Song recordings produced by Ike Turner Category:Kent Records singles Category:Manfred Mann songs Category:1965 singles Category:1967 singles Category:Piccadilly Records singles

63483524	I Am a Pilgrim	thumb|Early version of "I am a Pilgrim" lyrics and music from 1869 hymn book "I Am a Pilgrim" is a traditional Christian hymn from the United States, first documented in the mid-19th century. It forms part of the repertoire of gospel, folk, and bluegrass artists. The song combines elements from an "[o]ld hymn entwined with Poor Wayfaring Stranger (Sacred Harp - 1844). It appears in The Southern Zion's Songster (1864) and in Hymns For the Camp (1862)." The song references or alludes to several Bible passages, including the refrain, "I am a pilgrim and a stranger" which alludes to 1 Peter 2:11 and Hebrews 11:13 and also the lyric "If I could touch the hem of his garment" which references Matthew 9:20 where a woman touches the hem of Jesus' robe and is healed.Steve Turner, Turn, Turn, Turn: Popular Songs Inspired by the Bible, (2018) (accessed on books.google.com) In July 1924 the song was first recorded by Norfolk Jubilee Quartet, an African American group. Prominent musicians such as Bill Monroe, The Byrds, Johnny Cash, and Merle Travis have recorded the song. ==References== Category:Gospel songs Category:American Christian hymns Category:1924 singles Category:Public domain music Category:Bluegrass songs Category:African-American spiritual songs

63507230	I Am Not the One	"I Am Not the One" is a 2020 single released by Christian hip hop group Hostyle Gospel on January 3, 2020.

He also discussed the "pulse-pounding rhythms and raw lyrics" and how the group "ignit[ed] a fire of passion for God across America". ==References== Category:2020 singles Category:Hostyle Gospel songs

63657851	I Can Do Nothing Alone	I Can Do Nothing Alone is a studio album by American country singer-songwriter Bill Anderson. It was released in June 1967 on Decca Records and was produced by Owen Bradley. It was Anderson's seventh studio record and his first album to consist entirely of gospel music. Although the album did not produce any singles, it made peak positions on the Billboard country albums chart. ==Background and content== Anderson was inspired to record the album after the passing of his grandfather in 1965. Anderson recalled sitting beside him at the hospital when his grandfather said to him, "You don't have to be a preacher to do good in this world. You can live the right kind of life and let other people know that you stand for the right kind of things and they will get the message." This inspired Anderson to compose the album's title track "I Can Do Nothing Alone". The album consisted of ten tracks, all of which were gospel songs. All of the tracks were cut at the Columbia Recording Studio in February 1967 under the guidance of Owen Bradley. Among the songs recorded with Bradley included covers of traditional gospel songs. Songs featured included "Standing on the Promises", "Where He Leads Me" and "Blessed Assurance". ==Release and reception== I Can Do Nothing Alone was released in June 1967 on Decca Records. Five tracks were included on each side of the original record. Following its release, the album peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart in September 1967. The album spent 12 weeks on the country chart. The album did not produce any singles that were released. The album did however receive a rating from Allmusic, which gave it 2.5 out of 5 possible stars. Meanwhile, Billboard gave it a positive response in their June 1967 issue of the magazine. "Hit country artist Bill Anderson has a tremendous gospel hit here," writers commented. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== All credits are adapted from the liner notes of I Can Do Nothing Alone.

63681309	I Contain Multitudes	"I Contain Multitudes" is a song by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, the opening track on his 39th studio album, Rough and Rowdy Ways (2020). It was released as the album's second single on April 17, 2020, through Columbia Records. The title of the song is taken from Section 51 of the poem "Song of Myself" by Walt Whitman. The song was released, unannounced, less than a month after Dylan's previous single, "Murder Most Foul". The two singles were the first original material released by Dylan since his 2012 album Tempest. "I Contain Multitudes" reached number 5 on Billboards Rock Digital Song Sales chart. ==Background and themes== Dylan has long been fascinated by the concept of the multiplicity of the self, evident in everything from his fondness for Arthur Rimbaud's phrase "Je est un autre" ("I is another"), which he said caused bells to go off when he first read it in the 1960s, to the lyrics of his Rastafari-influenced 1983 song "I and I". In an interview to promote Time Out of Mind in 1997, Dylan said, "I change during the course of a day. I wake and I'm one person, and when I go to sleep I know for certain I'm somebody else. I don't know who I am most of the time. It doesn't even matter to me". A paraphrase of this last quote is spoken by Richard Gere's Billy the Kid character via voice-over narration in Todd Haynes' unconventional 2007 biopic I'm Not There (which features the subtitle "Inspired by the music and many lives of Bob Dylan" and takes Dylan's constantly-changing persona explicitly as its subject). Dylan's chameleon-like nature had caused critics to use Walt Whitman's line "I contain multitudes" in relation to him long before he ever wrote a song by that title. Dylan himself quoted the line in an interview for the 2019 documentary Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese. ==Lyrics == When asked about writing the song by historian Douglas Brinkley for an interview in The New York Times to promote the release of Rough and Rowdy Ways, Dylan noted that he "didn’t really have to grapple much. It’s the kind of thing where you pile up stream-of-consciousness verses and then leave it alone and come pull things out. In that particular song, the last few verses came first. So that’s where the song was going all along. Obviously, the catalyst for the song is the title line. It’s one of those where you write it on instinct. Kind of in a trance state. Most of my recent songs are like that. The lyrics are the real thing, tangible, they’re not metaphors". Brinkley also asked Dylan about the surprising inclusion of Anne Frank's name in the song, to which Dylan responded that Frank's story was "profound" before adding: "You could just as well ask, 'What made you decide to include Indiana Jones or the Rolling Stones'. The names themselves are not solitary. It’s the combination of them that adds up to something more than their singular parts. To go too much into detail is irrelevant. The song is like a painting, you can’t see it all at once if you’re standing too close. The individual pieces are just part of a whole...Somewhere in the universe those three names must have paid a price for what they represent and they’re locked together. And I can hardly explain that. Why or where or how, but those are the facts". ==Music== "I Contain Multitudes" is performed in the key of C major. Critics noted upon release of the single that there is a certain continuity when it is listened to alongside Dylan's previous single, "Murder Most Foul", which is performed in the same key (and that Rough and Rowdy Ways has a circular structure when listened to on repeat since they are the first and last tracks on the album, respectively). In all, there are six verses and two bridges, the latter of which are, according to Robert Dye in American Songwriter, "sung over a descending six-minor walkdown, contrasting with the dreamy feel of the verses and creating tension". The song has a slow tempo and a sparse arrangement featuring multiple acoustic guitars, a pedal steel guitar and an upright bass played with a bow. It is notable for being the only song on Rough and Rowdy Ways to feature no percussion. Also similar to "Murder Most Foul" is Dylan's vocal performance, which Tony Attwood describes as "[walking] a fine line between talking and singing". When Dylan played Lotte Lenya's version of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht's "Alabama Song" on the "Whiskey" episode of Theme Time Radio Hour, first broadcast in September 2020, he characterized her vocal technique as "sprechstimme", meaning half-spoken/half- sung, before humorously adding, "I use that sometimes myself". ==Release== The song was released unexpectedly on Dylan's YouTube channel on April 17, 2020, three weeks to the day after the stealth release of Dylan's previous single "Murder Most Foul". The YouTube video consists of the song accompanied by a still photograph of Dylan playing live in Salzburg, Austria that had been taken by Italian Dylan fan Andrea Orlandi in 1996 (a photograph that was also later included in one of the inner sleeves of the Rough and Rowdy Ways vinyl release). The single's release had been teased several hours before the song's premiere by a status update on Dylan's official Twitter account that featured the song title as a hashtag: #IContainMultitudes. == Critical reception == While reviewing Rough and Rowdy Ways in his Substack-published "Consumer Guide" column, Robert Christgau said the track "provides exactly the right thematic sendoff" within the context of the album's "elegiac retrospective". Mark Beaumont of NME called it a "sanguine personal exposé" and "a kind of literary folk 'My Way', a porch chair portrait of a life fully lived", in which Dylan "peels away the details of his journey with the grace and conciliation of a master making his peace". Several critics have commented on Dylan's surprising use of humor in the song, including NPR's Lauren Onkey who noted that the lyrics contain "a list of sometimes funny (we often forget that Dylan is funny) and preposterous brags of the singer's power and prowess that evoke the blues", and USA Today's Patrick Ryan who, in an article about the "Best Songs of 2020", referred to it as both "cheeky" and "quietly heartbreaking". Simon Vozick-Levinson, writing in a Rolling Stone article where the song placed 13th on a list of "The 25 Best Bob Dylan songs of the 21st Century", noted that it functions as a "bookend of sorts" to "Murder Most Foul" in that, in both, "Dylan seems to be considering his place in the constellation of great musicians and artists through the ages". The Sydney Morning Herald named "I Contain Multitudes" one of the "Top five Bob Dylan songs" in a 2021 article, calling it a "paean to unassailable self-knowledge [that] is sung like a man at peace with every detail". Spectrum Culture included the song on a list of "Bob Dylan's 20 Best Songs of the '10s and Beyond". The Pretenders' lead singer Chrissie Hynde told Rolling Stone that she found the song "fucking devastating" and that its release, along with the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, inspired her to finally realize her ambition of recording a Dylan covers album. Robert Plant claimed that, upon first hearing it, he "just went, ‘This is the story of all of our lives! Except he’s taken the bends in a totally different way, the curves’”, and claimed that being able to “voice somebody else’s condition” in a similar fashion was more than he could imagine as a lyricist. Actress/singer Rita Wilson included the song on a Spotify playlist of her favorite romantic Bob Dylan songs when promoting her 2020 single "I Wanna Kiss Bob Dylan". ==Cultural references== As with "Murder Most Foul", "I Contain Multitudes" contains many references to other artists and works of art over the past few centuries. The line "I rollick and I frolic with all the young dudes...I contain multitudes", for example, is a reference to David Bowie's song "All the Young Dudes", which became a hit for Mott the Hoople in 1972. In an article about "I Contain Multitudes" at Forward, Seth Rogovoy suggested this particular line "could be read as a similar nod toward queerness contained in the Bowie-penned original". The song also contains numerous references to Irish poetry and songs, in particular the work of W. B. Yeats, Antoine Ó Raifteiri and the song "Danny Boy". Although allusions to Irish poetry and song are nothing new in Dylan's work, some have speculated that these particular references may have been inspired by an evening Dylan spent in the company of fellow songwriter Shane MacGowan in Dublin while on tour in 2017. The line "I live on a boulevard of crime" is a reference to the setting of Marcel Carne's 1945 film Children of Paradise, one of Dylan's all-time favorite movies. Children of Paradise was an influence on Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour in 1975 and his 1978 film Renaldo and Clara, and he previously quoted a line from it ("Love is so simple") in the Blood on the Tracks song "You're a Big Girl Now". The line "I carry four pistols and two large knives" is a reference to Ward Will Lamon, an overarmed bodyguard who accompanied Abraham Lincoln to his inauguration, as described in Shelby Foote's The Civil War: A Narrative. This is the first of six references to U.S. Presidents on Rough and Rowdy Ways (the other five of which come in the album's final two songs: "Key West (Philosopher Pirate)" and "Murder Most Foul"). == Live performances == "I Contain Multitudes" received its live debut at the Riverside Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on November 2, 2021, the first concert of Dylan's Rough and Rowdy Ways World Wide Tour. == Charts == Chart performance for "I Contain Multitudes" Chart (2020) Peak position US Rock Digital Song Sales (Billboard) 5 ==Accolades== Accolades for "I Contain Multitudes" Publication Accolade Rank The Sydney Morning Herald Top Five Bob Dylan Songs N/A USA Today 10 Best Songs of 2020 7 Rolling Stone The 25 Best Bob Dylan Songs of the 21st Century 13 Slate 20 Best Songs of 2020 N/A Spectrum Culture Bob Dylan's 20 Best Songs of the '10s and Beyond N/A The Los Angeles Times 50 Best Songs of 2020 N/A Inside of Knoxville 25 Best Dylan Songs of the Last 25 Years N/A Spin 50 Best Songs of 2020 (So Far) 49 ==Cover versions== The song was covered by Australian singer/songwriter Emma Swift on her 2020 album Blonde on the Tracks.

6375309	I Choose	"I Choose" is a punk rock song by the Offspring. It is the eighth track on their fourth studio album, Ixnay on the Hombre (1997), and was released as its fourth and final single. The single enjoyed less commercial success compared with the previous singles from the album and was omitted from the band's Greatest Hits album (2005). However, it became another top 10 Hot Mainstream Rock Track for The Offspring. ==Literary reference== The song, in its second verse, contains a literary reference to J. D. Salinger's short story, "A Perfect Day for Bananafish." In the story, the protagonist, who is suicidally depressed, tells a little girl at a Florida beach a story about bananafish, a fictional species of fish that hides in its burrow, eating bananas, until it is trapped inside forever and dies of banana fever.Salinger, J. D. "A Perfect Day for Bananafish." The New Yorker. 31 Jan. 1948: 21-25. 4 Oct. 2010 . In the original work, the bananafish is a tragic creature, but the song looks at the tragedy and laughs anyway, saying it "doesn't really matter" and shrugging off the self-pity of the original. ==Track listing== ==Music video== The video for the song was directed by the band's lead singer and songwriter, Dexter Holland. The video takes place in an airport, where the band members depart from a taxi cab. While people are dancing, a skateboarder skates through. When his bag is checked, the x-ray sees a "ticking clock". Thinking that it is a bomb, a security guard chases him down only to open his bag and find a Flava Flav style clock necklace. This footage is spliced with footage of the band performing antics of their own (such as lead guitarist Noodles playing the solo on a conveyor belt) and performing in a completely different place where heavy winds blow trash into their equipment. On the Greatest Hits DVD, the band joked about the idea of making a video like this now, with the seriousness of airport security. The band considered it one of their best music videos. ===DVD appearances=== The music video appears also appears on the Complete Music Video Collection DVD. It was released in 2005. ==Charts== Chart (1997) Peak position Australia (ARIA) 79 ==References== Category:The Offspring songs Category:Songs written by Dexter Holland Category:1997 singles Category:Skate punk songs
63774396	I Can't Seem to Say Goodbye	"I Can't Seem to Say Goodbye" is a song written by Don Robertson and originally recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis during his time with Sun Records. The recording didn't see the light of day until 1970, when it was included on the second Jerry Lee Lewis album released by the new owner of Sun Records, Shelby Singleton. (In June 1969, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips sold the entire Sun catalog to Shelby Singleton, which included a treasure trove of unreleased Lewis recordings. With Jerry Lee's rebirth as a country star for Smash Records, Singleton began releasing these older songs and packaged them in such a way that many buyers assumed they were recent recordings.) The song was also released as a single from that album, reaching number 6 on the Cash Box Country Singles chart and number 7 on the Billboard country chart. == Track listing == == Charts == Chart (1970) Peak position US Cash Box Country Singles 6 ==Other versions== Bob Dylan performed a live cover of the song in Nottingham, England on October 28, 2022, the same day that Lewis died. Dylan introduced the song by telling the audience, "I don’t know how many of you know, but Jerry Lee’s gone. We’re gonna play this song, one of his. Jerry Lee will live forever – we all know that". == References == Category:Songs about parting Category:1970 songs Category:1970 singles Category:Jerry Lee Lewis songs Category:Sun Records singles Category:American country music songs
63853750	I Am Love (Jennifer Holliday song)	"I Am Love" is a song by singer Jennifer Holliday, released as a single in 1983 by Geffen Records from her album Feel My Soul. The song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot R&B; Singles chart. ==Overview== "I Am Love" was produced by Maurice White and written by White, David Foster and Allee Willis. The B-side of the single is a song called "Heartstrings". ==Critical reception== Stephen Holden of The New York Times called "I Am Love" a "big, bursting ballad..that deliberately recall(s) her Dreamgirls arias" and a "big, swelling tune and lyrics that make a grand pronouncement". Johnny Loftus of Allmusic proclaimed that "I Am Love" is the real standout. Beginning as a fluttering, austere piano ballad, the song abruptly shifts into high gear, where Holliday's high note trills and enormous chorus vocalizing recall her mind-blowing performance of "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" from Dreamgirls." ==References== Category:1983 songs Category:1983 singles Category:Geffen Records singles Category:Songs written by David Foster Category:Songs written by Allee Willis Category:Songs written by Maurice White Category:Song recordings produced by Maurice White
63913705	I Am Jonas	I Am Jonas is a French coming of age gay-themed movie released in 2018 and directed by Christophe Charrier. The film is also known as Boys and Jonas. ==Plot== The plot is written in chronological order while the movie switches continuously between present and past. It is 1997. Fifteen-year-old Jonas does not really have friends at school. When the school year starts, there is a new pupil in his class: Nathan, who immediately takes Jonas under his wing and they become friends. Nathan has a Nintendo Game Boy and teaches Jonas how to play Tetris and eventually gives him the computer as a gift. The two fall in love and start a relationship. Jonas is allowed by his parents to spend the weekend at Nathan's house. Nathan's mother is heavily pregnant and has already chosen a name for the child: Léonard. She drives the boys to a movie theatre, and on the ride they pass an amusement park called Magic World. Mother reveals to Jonas that Nathan got the scar on his face after an incident at the bumper cars, although Nathan had earlier told Jonas that it was caused by an attack of a pedophile priest. At the end of the movie they just watched, Nathan turns on his mobile phone and hears a message left by his mother: she went into hospital to give birth. Instead of going to the hospital, they go to Boys, a local gay bar. As the minimum age is eighteen years they are not allowed in. This is noticed by a man who has an idea: he will bring the boys to another gay bar where there is no age limit. They get in his car but soon Nathan gets suspicious as the ride takes too long and the boys plead with the driver to let them out. The driver punches Nathan and knocks him out. Jonas pulls up the handbrake and is able to escape.

64088965	I Can See the Change	"I Can See the Change" is a song by British singer Celeste, released on 27 May 2020. The ballad was produced by American musician Finneas O'Connell soon after the duo met each other in person at the 2020 Brit Awards. == Background and composition == "I Can See the Change" is the followup to Celeste's January 2020 single "Stop This Flame" which achieved major European mainstream radio airplay success in early 2020. Celeste revealed the song (originally titled "The Change") to the Italian magazine Di Repubblica in April 2020. Following Celeste's performance of the song "Strange" at the 2020 Brit Awards, producer Finneas O'Connell tweeted a screenshot of the song's album art and wrote, "Heard this song for the first time when performing at the brits and fell in love with it immediately," further telling The Line of Best Fit that he was "blown away" and that he "immediately went home and downloaded her entire catalogue." Celeste told Vogue about her encounter with O'Connell and his sister Billie Eilish at the ceremony: "Finneas and I had a brief encounter and just said hello, but later I sent him the demo to see if he wanted to work on it. He was up for it so we just started talking over text for hours over the course of a few days until we finished. He’d iMessage me with different sounds asking, 'Do you like this?' and I’d go 'Yeah!' until we had the finished song." Celeste told DIY that the idea of the song came to her when she was feeling "disconnected from [her]self" and that she knew that "something needed to change". She expressed to The List that the song is ultimately about "hope and change but knowing that to obtain this requires effort, patience and conviction." As the song was released amid the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, Celeste wrote that it took on a "new and more powerful meaning" because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the "global reinvigoration" of the movement." == Music video == The music video for "I Can See the Change" was filmed during the COVID-19 lockdown in Celeste's living room. The black- and-white visual directed by Sophie Jones via Zoom call, and was described by Vogue as Celeste's "most evocative visual to date". Keaton Bell wrote, "Channeling the old-school glamour of classic film noir, Celeste sings of her desire for change in many forms alongside footage from a 1963 Martin Luther King Jr. rally,". == Critical reception == Tom Skinner of NME described "I Can See the Change" as a "stirring ballad" which includes "subtle orchestral elements" which accompany Celeste's "powerful" vocals as the track progresses. Mike Wass of Idolator dubbed the song as a "stripped-back, optimistic ballad," with The Times also describing it as a "gorgeously smokey ballad". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that the song "negotiates the digital and human, striving to stay embodied", and described Celeste as "a singer defying Auto- Tune to waver and swoop like Amy Winehouse and, perhaps, Billie Holiday." Sarah Jamieson of DIY wrote described the song as "a bittersweet but redemptive track which glimmers with hope." Billy Niles of E! wrote that the "stunning" single is "a stirringly optimistic piece about hope and change that soars thanks, in large part, to her smoky vocal." == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from Tidal: * Celeste – vocals, songwriter * Finneas O'Connell – producer, background vocals, engineer (recording; mastering), bass vocals, synthesizer, piano, string arrangement, studio personnel * Nathan Boddy – mixer, studio personnel * John Davis – mastering engineer, studio personnel * David Palmer – songwriter * Jamie Hartman – songwriter * Sean Douglas – songwriter * Sebastian Plano – strings == Charts == Chart (2020) Peak position Netherlands (Dutch Tipprade) 12 Netherlands (Mega Top 30) 7 == References == Category:2020 singles Category:2020 songs Category:Celeste (singer) songs Category:2020s ballads Category:Song recordings produced by Finneas O'Connell Category:Songs written by Jamie Hartman Category:Songs written by Sean Douglas (songwriter)
64116185	I Confess (song)	"I Confess" is a 1982 song written and recorded by British band the Beat (known in the United States and Canada as the English Beat). The song was released as a single from the band's third and final studio album, Special Beat Service, finding moderate chart success in the UK. Inspired by the romantic escapades of English tabloids and Wakeling's own personal relationships, the song featured a piano performance led by touring keyboardist Dave "Blockhead" Wright. As the album's third single, "I Confess" found moderate success on the charts, peaking at No. 54 in the UK. The song was praised by critics. A music video for the track was also produced, featuring the band's parody of the New Romantics. ==Background== Lyrically, "I Confess" was a mix of Beat frontman Dave Wakeling's personal experiences and sensationalized stories that he had read in magazines. Wakeling had been a frequent reader of these magazines; he recalled, "At the same time, I had a bit of an obsession with what was called 'Photo Love' in England. They were those teen magazines where they had photographs with bubbles coming out of their mouths. Broken hearts and redemption, that sort of thing. I loved the cloying, hyper-driven emotion of them, and I'd had my photograph as a pin-up in a couple of them". Wakeling then connected his "own tawdry tales of young love" with a tabloid story about a man who "had been caught having sex with his new bride's sister on their wedding day". Musically, the song had originated from a riff composed by Beat touring keyboardist Dave "Blockhead" Wright. Wright had filled in for Beat saxophonist Saxa and introduced a piano part he had composed to Wakeling. Wakeling explained, Wakeling compared David Steele's bass part to Chic. ==Release and critical reception== "I Confess" was released as the third single from Special Beat Service (1982), with "Sole Salvation" on the B-side. The single peaked at number 54 on the UK Singles Chart. AllMusic's Stewart Mason pointed to the song's atypical lyrics and musical style as off-putting for some Beat fans, leading to a level of skepticism toward the song. In the US, the track went to number 34 on the Billboard Dance/Disco Top 80 chart. "I Confess" has seen positive critical reception since its release. Mason said of the track, "It's actually a startlingly well-constructed song, as well as one of the group's most unforgettable singles", while fellow AllMusic writer Jo-Ann Greene praised its "Joe Jackson-esque piano line". In a 1982 interview, Elvis Costello praised the song as "one of the most beautiful bits of singing I've heard all year". Wakeling had previously named Costello's "Secondary Modern" as one of his all- time top ten favorite songs. ==Music video== The song's single release was accompanied by a music video. Wakeling recalled that the video satirized the "New Romantic" style that had been gaining in popularity during the early 1980s.

64437040	I Called Mama	"I Called Mama" is a song recorded by American country music artist Tim McGraw. It was released in May 2020 as the lead-off single to his sixteenth studio album Here on Earth, and is his first single since returning to Big Machine Records earlier in the year. ==Content== "I Called Mama" was written by Marv Green, Lance Miller, and Jimmy Yeary. Released just before Mother's Day, the song is described as "a gently ebbing ballad led by acoustic guitar and washes of pedal steel [...] about not putting things off until it's too late", which leads to a phone call home to the narrator's mother. McGraw originally expected the song to just remain an album cut, but in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, he felt the song took on a new meaning: "There was a lot of carrying a lot of weight along with it, and as you listen to it and you think about the personal level, but that's something that's sort of existential in a way that speaks to things that are going on outside of what the song is saying, and to have a personal song that's something that big when you look at it from a different perspective when the world changed, it was hard to ignore. It was hard to not want to pay attention to the song being, for me, a sort of catharsis during this time". ==Music video== The music video premiered on May 27, 2020, and is "a tribute to mothers everywhere" with clips of McGraw's fans and their mothers, as well as appearances by his own mother, Betty Trimble, and wife, Faith Hill. ==Chart performance== "I Called Mama" debuted on Billboard Country Airplay at No. 20 for the chart dated May 11, 2020, his third top 20 debut on the chart.Billboard Country Update May 11, 2020 It also debuted at No. 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the chart dated July 11, 2020.Billboard Hot 100: July 11, 2020 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2020) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2020) Position US Country Airplay (Billboard) 38 US Hot Country Songs (Billboard) 39 ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2020 singles Category:2020 songs Category:Tim McGraw songs Category:Songs written by Marv Green Category:Songs written by Lance Miller Category:Songs written by Jimmy Yeary Category:Song recordings produced by Byron Gallimore Category:Song recordings produced by Tim McGraw Category:Big Machine Records singles Category:Songs about mothers

6498078	I Belong to Me	"I Belong to Me" is a song by American recording artist Jessica Simpson from her fifth studio album, A Public Affair. The song was written by Diane Warren and produced by Stargate. It was released on September 26, 2006 by Epic Records, as the second single from the album. Originally the song was not included in the standard version of the album, but was released in a version of Walmart as a bonus track. The lyrics of "I Belong to Me" is constructed in verse-chorus format and focuses on the dissatisfaction of love. The song received mixed reviews from critics. In the United States, the single reached number 10 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 and at number ninety-nine the Billboard Pop 100. ==Subject matter== When asked in an interview whether she had written songs that were reflective of her life, Diane Warren named "I Belong to Me", saying "that's one of the closer songs to me, because I feel that. I don't need someone to complete me. I complete myself. I don't believe that you need a person to complete you. That's my philosophy." Simpson said of the song, "It's a very powerful statement ... about owning yourself and controlling yourself. It's part of evolving, of growing up and becoming a woman." ==Critical reception== "I Belong to Me" received mixed reviews from music critics. According to Billboard magazine, the song has the same "self- empowerment theme" as Simpson's 2004 single "With You". Billboard wrote that "Simple R&B-lite; production allows Simpson's lovely vocal to hold the reins, making for a song (written by the incomparable Diane Warren) that is a thematic bull's-eye for her female teen target [...] let's see if programmers make this release more of the public affair it deserves to be". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote, "I Belong To Me," an exclusive Walmart bonus track, will instead be the follow-up, a coup for the retail giant and a big fuck-you to competitors and unknowing fans who pick up the album anywhere else. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone (magazine) gave the song two stars out of five going on to say, "Did Ashlee get all the talent? On Jessica's big post-divorce statement, she still sounds like a prissy kid, braying, "I complete myself" in "I Belong to Me," her answer to Nick Lachey's "What's Left of Me." ==Commercial release== Before the release of A Public Affair, the song was taken off the album's track listing--Simpson said that this was because she "was kind of afraid to sing the song"--and only the Wal-Mart edition of the album included the song as a bonus track. It was believed that the song had hit potential, and consequently Simpson's record label added it to subsequent versions of the album. During August 2006, Simpson's fans could listen on her official website to the songs "B.O.Y.", "I Belong to Me", "I Don't Want to Care", "If You Were Mine", "The Lover in Me" and "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)", and vote for which song would become the second single. It was reported in early September that Simpson had chosen "I Belong to Me" as the second single. In the United States, "I Belong to Me" was made available for airplay at mainstream contemporary hit radio stations on September 26. During the same period, the song debuted at number twenty-five on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and at number ninety-nine on the Billboard Pop 100. It spent three non-consecutive weeks on each chart (until early November), peaking at number ten on the former and at number ninety on the latter. It failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Music video== ===Background and concept=== The music video for the song directed by Matthew Rolston was filmed in September 2006. It was given a "sneak peek" on MTV's Total Request Live in the U.S. on October 4, and was premiered in its entirety on October 11. On October 3, 2009 the video was released to the official VEVO channel Simpson, currently has over 4 million reproductions. Simpson said that the shoot was "a very emotional time" for her, and that she thought viewers of the video would "experience what I've been experiencing for the past year". The video shows Simpson with platinum blonde hair. It begins with a close-up Jessica's face with focus clear images. Then she is lying on a bed, takes a piece of clothing and throws it to the ground. The room has boxes from moving, marked Bedroom. She walks around the room and looks out a window. She keeps walking and looks in a mirror, uses scissors and begins to jaggedly cut off her hair. She takes an eye pencil, and starts exaggeratedly drawing on eyeliner. After she places a crown on her head, she starts to cry. She goes back to the bathroom and cleans off the makeup. ==Credits and personnel== *Vocals: Jessica Simpson *Songwriting: Diane Warren *Production: Stargate Credits adapted from A Public Affair liner notes. ==Charts== Chart (2006) Peak position US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100http://www.billboard.com/biz/search/charts?f%5B0%5D=is_bmdb_track_id%3A6171194&f;%5B1%5D=itm_field_chart_id%3A344&refine;=1 10 US Pop 100 (Billboard) 90 ==References== Category:2006 singles Category:2006 songs Category:Jessica Simpson songs Category:Epic Records singles Category:Pop ballads Category:Contemporary R&B; ballads Category:Music videos directed by Matthew Rolston Category:Song recordings produced by Stargate (record producers) Category:Songs written by Diane Warren Category:2000s ballads

65933104	I Am Dead	I Am Dead is a puzzle adventure video game from independent British developer Hollow Pond. It was published by Annapurna Interactive on October 8, 2020 for Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch. Versions for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Series S were released on August 9, 2021. The game follows Morris Lupton, a museum curator on the island of Shelmerston who recently died. Reunited with the ghost of his dog, Sparky, he discovers that a disaster is about to destroy the island. They both must uncover the ancient mysteries of Shelmerston and stop the island's volcano from erupting, saving the island. To do this, the player has the ability to see inside objects and people, revealing their contents and memories. == Reception == I Am Dead was met by generally positive reviews, according to the review aggregator Metacritic. Nintendo Lifes Stuart Gipp enjoyed the game's themes but criticized the writing and simplistic gameplay. "I Am Dead is an at times touching and generally thoughtful exploration of loss, grief and lasting memories that doesn’t quite resonate as much as it could due to some occasionally-too-twee writing and gameplay that doesn’t quite disguise the fact that it’s a glorified hidden object game." Joe Skrebels of IGN felt mixed on the usage of I am Dead additional challenges, "The separation of the core story and those tougher challenges feels like something of a compromise from developer Hollow Ponds to me, an attempt to offer both an easygoing narrative and something for those who want to be tested, when both sides could perhaps be made more satisfying by combining them." == References == ==External links== * Category:2020 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Video games about ghosts Category:Indie games Category:Puzzle video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games Category:Windows games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Annapurna Interactive games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set on fictional islands Category:Video games about death Category:Video games about dogs
66072168	I Am Groot	I Am Groot is an American series of animated shorts created by Kirsten Lepore for the streaming service Disney+, based on the Marvel Comics featuring the character Groot. It features characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), following Baby Groot on various adventures that get him into trouble between the events of Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and one of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) mid-credits scenes. The series is produced by Marvel Studios Animation, with Lepore serving as head writer and director. Vin Diesel reprises his role as the voice of Baby Groot from the MCU films, with Bradley Cooper also starring. I Am Groot was announced in December 2020, and Luma Pictures began work on the series' photorealistic animation by August 2021. The involvement of Lepore was revealed that November. I Am Groot premiered with five shorts on Disney+ on August 10, 2022, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. Five additional shorts are in development. == Premise == Each short follows Baby Groot as he grows up in the galaxy, going on adventures with new and unusual characters that get him into trouble. == Cast and characters == * Vin Diesel as Baby Groot: A member of the Guardians of the Galaxy who is a tree-like humanoid. Executive producer Brad Winderbaum called Baby Groot "imperfect" who "doesn't always make the right choices, but learns from his mistakes", adding it was "fun to watch him fail, and it's even more fun to watch him succeed". * Bradley Cooper as Rocket: A member of the Guardians who is a genetically modified raccoon bounty hunter and a master of weapons and military tactics. Director Kirsten Lepore described Rocket as "bit of a scolding parent" towards Groot, but still his friend "with a soft heart", with Winderbaum stating that Rocket feels responsible for Groot as "an unlikely parent". Additionally, James Gunn voices a wrist watch and Trevor Devall voices Iwua, a shapeshifting alien who mimics Groot. == Episodes == == Production == === Development === In December 2020, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige announced I Am Groot, a series of short films starring Baby Groot. Around then, Marvel Studios' head of streaming, television and animation Brad Winderbaum chose Kirsten Lepore to direct the shorts, which would have "little-to-no dialogue". Marvel Studios was looking for a way to return to the Baby Groot character after his appearance in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) since they felt there was "a whole universe of stories to tell" with him as a toddler. They also were drawn to early Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck short films as a way to "go back to that early Disney animation short-form style of storytelling". Lepore was announced as director of the shorts during the Disney+ Day event in November 2021; she is also the series' head writer. I Am Groot consists of five shorts, totaling approximately 15 minutes, produced by Marvel Studios Animation. The shorts are executive produced by Marvel Studios' Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, and Winderbaum, as well as James Gunn, the writer and director of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, and Lepore. Production on five additional shorts was underway by July 2022, described as a second season. Lepore said this second collection of shorts would be "in the same spirit" as the first, and features ideas she had that did not make the first collection of shorts. === Writing === Lepore drew inspiration from her son, and said the series uses science fiction elements to explore Groot's regular childhood moments. She met with Gunn throughout the process to ensure that she was accurately portraying Baby Groot, who Gunn described to her as a "bad baby". Lepore was also inspired by Looney Tunes as well as a Buster Keaton style of smart, physical comedy, which Feige and Winderbaum were also excited to explore. Marvel Studios was able to create animatics more easily given I Am Groot is shorts, allowing them to "play with bits and... concepts" to see what worked and find the identity of the series. For the first short, "Groot's First Steps", Lepore wanted to explore Groot growing out of his pot, and was able to incorporate that with another idea of Groot, a sentient tree, going up against a non- sentient tree, which allowed her to explore Keaton physical comedy "in which the inanimate object always wins". "Groot's Pursuit" was conceived thinking about how children can mimic one another, resulting in one getting frustrated by it. Lepore was also interested in exploring Groot's physical abilities, which led to the short "Groot Takes a Bath". She described Groot as becoming a Chia Pet, which resulted in "a very fun arena to play in". Gunn said the series was not necessarily connected to his Guardians of the Galaxy films, and described them as being "canon to themselves" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Joshua Meyer from /Film likened this to the Team Thor mockumentary shorts which he called a "funny bit of apocrypha that isn't essential to MCU continuity". Winderbaum said the shorts were set between the end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and that film's mid-credits scene which featured a teenage Groot, with Lepore adding that it also showed events between the end of Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and the start of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Gunn later stated he found it hard to see how they were "canonically MCU" despite Marvel saying they were. Other members of the Guardians of the Galaxy do not appear in the series, outside of Rocket, as the creatives were interested in focusing on Groot and "getting to know his character better" while also exploring the fun of seeing "what he does when nobody's looking" since "that's where he gets into the most trouble". === Casting === Vin Diesel was confirmed to be reprising his role as the voice of Baby Groot in June 2022. Diesel recorded new lines for the shorts, after it was initially discussed to reuse existing recordings of him saying "I am Groot" for the series. The next month, Bradley Cooper was revealed to be reprising his MCU role as the voice of Rocket, as well as Gunn voicing a wrist watch. Trevor Devall voices Iwua. Bob Bergen, Terri Douglas, Scott Menville, Kaitlyn Robrock, Fred Tatasciore, Kari Wahlgren, and Matthew Wood provide additional voices. === Design === Baby Groot is the same model designed by Luma Pictures for Vol. 2. Lepore enjoyed designing the Grunds, seen in "Little Guys", and finding the way to make them be expressive with "just black dots and a mouth". Other original designs for the series included Iwua, the shapeshifting alien, and Snoot Pin Bongo, a squirrel-like creature inspired by the Star Wars character Salacious Crumb. Perception created the titles for I Am Groot. The series presents the Marvel Studios opening and fanfare fast-forwarding. Lepore was looking to get "really irreverent" with the opening, with Winderbaum adding the studio was always looking for ways to shorten the opening. The creatives liked this since it helped balance the runtime of the shorts without having "a minute-and-a-half opening" along with "a five-minute credit sequence", with Lepore calling it the perfect design for Groot. === Animation and editing === Work on the series' photorealistic animation style began by August 2021. Winderbaum explained that Marvel Studios wanted I Am Groot to feel "directly rooted in the language of the films", which is why they chose visual effects company Luma Pictures to animate the series since they previously designed and worked on Baby Groot for Vol. 2. Winderbaum highlighted how Lepore's experience working with stop motion animation translated to her directing computer-generated animation. When talking to Lepore, Gunn compared Baby Groot's poses and facial expressions to emojis due the character's face just having eyes and a mouth. Initial conceptions of the episodes in the storyboard and animatic stages resulted in the shorts being about five minutes. Lepore was aiming for each short to be approximately three minutes in length, and made refinements and "edited very carefully" to get them to that runtime. == Music == Daniele Luppi served as the composer for the first five shorts of I Am Groot. Lepore chose Luppi to score the series given his past work with an electronic sound, which helped translate to the "strange" sound she was looking for. She added that his score "sounds like it came out of a Spaghetti Western with the same kind of patina on it from that era". Luppi used old microphones, keyboards, and other analog instruments to give his score an "authentic, more organic sound". A single featuring the songs "Groot Bossa Nova" and "Groot Tuttifrutti" from the shorts was released digitally by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records on August 4, 2022. Lepore wanted to feature music from the 1960s and 1970s, and looked at music from around the world instead of just the United States, to differ it from the music featured in the Guardians of the Galaxy films. Licensed songs in the series include "In the Hall of the Mountain Queen" by Raymond Scott in "Groot's First Steps", which Lepore noted instantly gives the short a "really weird flavor, this spacey, early electro feel", "Ran Kan Kan" by Tito Puente in "Groot's Pursuit", and "You Can Get It If You Really Want" by Jimmy Cliff in "Magnum Opus". == Marketing == Brief footage from the series was shown during Disney's annual meeting of shareholders in March 2022 within a content highlight reel. The first poster for the series, announcing its release date, was revealed on June 5, which made the series "immediately [begin] trending online". According to Variety Trending TV chart, it amassed 231,000 user engagements, which measure the combination of tweets, retweets, likes, and hashtags, the second most for the week of May 30 to June 5, behind the Netflix series Stranger Things. Marvel Studios partnered with Wonderful Pistachios and Framestore for a "Groot Gets Crackin'" marketing campaign, featuring Groot across television advertisements, digital and social media posts, and limited- edition packaging for their pistachios, as well as in-store displays until August 31. A 15-second television spot was released on June 6, as part of the campaign. Tickets to attend Marvel's Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. in Las Vegas were also set to be given out randomly to customers who bought their pistachios as part of the campaign. The short "Magnum Opus" debuted at the El Capitan Theatre, appearing before select screenings of the MCU film Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), from July 18 to 24. The short "Groot Takes a Bath" was shown during Marvel Studios' animation panel at San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, where Lepore discussed the series and a trailer for all of the shorts was also released. Posters for each short were released ahead of their premiere. == Release == I Am Groot premiered with five shorts on Disney+ on August 10, 2022, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. == Reception == === Audience viewership === I Am Groot was the third highest streaming series for viewers in the United States for the week ending August 14, 2022, according to Whip Media's TV Time. === Critical response === The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 87% approval rating, with an average score of 7.70/10, based on 15 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads: "He is Groot, and that novelty alone ought to give MCU fans a rooting interest in this slight but fun series of hijinks." Matt Fowler of IGN gave I Am Groot 7 out of 10, finding the shorts "adorable as an animated offshoot of the MCU but also contain a quirky dark humor thanks to [Baby] Groot's own temper and penchant for getting punchy." Fowler noted how Groot's prickliness was "a saving grace... as these types of shorts rarely showcase a brat." Andrew Webster of The Verge considered the series as one of the greatest animated shorts on Disney+, feeling the shorts were "fun and goofy". Webster also found that the short runtime "works well here — the gimmick doesn't last long enough to overstay its welcome." Varietys Wilson Chapman said I Am Groot was "charming, briskly paced and — in a rarity for a Marvel streaming TV show — completely self-contained, with no cameos or set-ups for another show to speak-of". Brett White from Decider likened the series to Looney Tunes with "mayhem in the best way possible" and called I Am Groot "a damn from beginning to end", saying, "Each short zips along at a perfect pace, deploying sight gags that hit their mark every time." White was frustrated, however, with each short being their own entry on Disney+ rather than collected under one title. Nick Schager at The Daily Beast was positive on the shorts, saying their "brevity prevents it from growing stale, and yet given that each chapter runs only four minutes, a little extra time might have let it playfully elaborate upon its conceits". He also enjoyed the animation, saying I Am Groot "boasts a handsome vibrancy and level of detail". == References == == External links == * at Marvel.com * Category:2020s American animated television series Category:2020s American comic science fiction television series Category:2020s American children's comedy television series Category:2022 American television series debuts Category:American children's animated comic science fiction television series Category:American children's animated superhero television series Category:American computer-animated television series Category:Animated television series based on Marvel Comics Category:Disney short film series Category:Disney+ original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Guardians of the Galaxy (film series) Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe shorts Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four mass media Category:Television series by Marvel Studios Category:Television shows based on Marvel Comics Category:Television shows based on works by Jack Kirby Category:Television shows based on works by Stan Lee Category:Works by James Gunn
66122486	I Am Norman	I Am Norman is a 2020 British docu-fiction LGBTQ+ thriller short film directed by Arron Blake and Darius Shu. The film follows a filmmaker documenting a man who lives in a car as he takes him into the woods to share a dark secret. The film aims to raise awareness of the effects of gay conversion therapy and suicide. It is executive produced by Philip Brisebois and produced by Silverprince Pictures in association with Little Deer Films. == Synopsis == A conversion therapy survivor takes a filmmaker into the words to share a dark secret. == Cast == * Arron Blake as Norman == Production == Filmed in August over three days during the UK's first national COVID-19 lockdown, Blake and Shu wanted to proved themselves of making a visually beautiful provocative film during a pandemic with just a two-man crew, with Shu as cinematographer/co-director and Blake starring as Norman. I Am Norman is another testament to Blake and Shu's ability to sculpt something compelling and unique with a skeleton crew and a meagre budget. == Style and themes == The film is shot in a faux documentary style with Norman chatting to the camera. Blake and Shu wanted to create something different and push the boundaries of visual storytelling with the aim of sending out a powerful social message. It tackles a serious issue within the LGBTQ+ community – in this case, mental health struggles, suicide, family rejection and the damaging effects of gay conversion therapy. Voice Magazine pointed out that the "depictions we have seen of conversion therapy in entertainment are films like Boy Erased and The Miseducation of Cameron Post...these films depict conversion camps in a light which is probably pretty accurate. The rules, the restrictions, the citing of scripture and the inevitable suicide that comes from forcing and shaming a person into thinking their very existence is a sin. Where I Am Norman differs is that it achieves all of this through the story of one man – Norman. The story it tells is more abstract, and the picture it paints is through obscurity." Viddy Well described the style for I Am Norman as "much more loose in style and structure in comparison to their debut Tribeca film His Hands but no less effective, Blake and Shu take an easy-going and free-spirited approach to the cinematography and direction here. This gives the film a naturalistic and intimate quality that enhances its realism and counterbalances its moments of humorous absurdity. The documentary framing device is extremely effective. It makes everything more playful and conversational, and it successfully creates the illusion that we’re there with the character as they share their dark secrets with us....With its quirky outsider character, dark focus, provocative nature, and humorous and hard- hitting moments, it feels like a Harmony Korine directed, LGBTQ+ version of Man Bites Dog with a twist." Indy Reviews describe how clever "the motif of the camera in the film draws specific attention to the idea of watching and being watched. In a sense, it appears that we are holding the camera and Norman is talking to the audience directly". == Music == Matthew Barton contributed the original song "A Peaceful Killing" to the film's soundtrack. "A Peaceful Killing" was written by Shu, Barton, and produced by Barton, and mixed and mastered by Sam Wain. Blake and Shu approached the singer-songwriter to contribute an original song to the film. Chalkpit Records complimented the song as, "A torrent of movielike musicality...'A Peaceful Killing' should soundtrack more than just a movie this winter." Matthew Barton explains that the song "tensions between the ‘beautiful and the brutal". == Reception == === Critical response === The film received generally favourable and positive reviews from film critics. Writing for Film Threat, Norman Gidney gave the film an 8 out of 10 and describe I AM Norman as, "A refined piece of work from two talented filmmakers. It has a voice, a message, and a reason to exist. The subtleties in Blake’s performance, along with the convincing yet artistic work of Shu’s camera, craft a painful portrait of regret and survival." Alex Clement of HeyUGuys gave the film 5 out of 5 rating complimenting that , "The film is a masterpiece with real power and emotion...executed and beautifully capture with Blake playing Norman with such conviction." HeyUGuys also describe how Blake and Shu created a film that "carries certain essences of the likes of Tarantino, Hitchcock and Kubrick and seems like a fusion of all three." Olivia Ballington from IndyReviews commended that, "Blake’s portrayal of Norman is truly magnificent and it cuts to the core...combined with Shu’s aesthetically involved cinematography, I AM Norman is an astonishing accomplishment." Culture Fix gave the film a 5 out of 5 saying how "Blake crafts the character with an inventive level of precision" and how "Blake and Shu direct with a claustrophobic intensity... Norman is always framed somewhat uncomfortably close to the camera." Saskia Calliste of Voice Magazine highly praised the film as, "silently masterful, and Blake’s portrayal of such a character is one that I won’t be forgetting in a hurry... I AM Norman prove you should never assume a film can’t make an impact without a big budget and a three-hour time slot, it disturbs the devil you know and recontextualies the one you may have heard of but not considered as a pressing societal threat." Voice Magazine also called the film, "a uniquely disturbing take on the repercussions of conversion therapy." Indie Shorts Mag gave the film a 5 out of 5 and described the film as "Hauntingly beautiful". I AM Norman also entered Indie Shorts Mag's Hall of Fame. A recognition awarded to short film's that have scored the 5 out of 5 ratings on their website. == References == == External links == * Category:2020 films Category:2020 LGBT-related films Category:2020 short films Category:British LGBT-related films Category:2020 thriller films Category:Films about conversion therapy Category:Gay-related films Category:2020s English-language films Category:2020s British films

6641931	I Am Legend (film)	I Am Legend is a 2007 American post-apocalyptic action thriller film directed by Francis Lawrence from a screenplay by Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevich and starring Will Smith as US Army virologist Robert Neville. Loosely based on the 1954 novel of the same name by Richard Matheson, the film is set in New York City after a virus, which was originally created to cure cancer, has wiped out most of mankind, leaving Neville as the last human in New York, other than nocturnal mutants. Neville is immune to the virus, and he works to develop a cure while defending himself against the hostile mutants. It is the third feature-film adaptation of Matheson's novel following 1964's The Last Man on Earth and 1971's The Omega Man. Warner Bros. began developing I Am Legend in 1994 and various actors and directors were attached to the project, though production was delayed due to budgetary concerns related to the script. Production began in 2006 in New York City, filming mainly on location in the city, including a $5 million scene at the Brooklyn Bridge. I Am Legend was released on December 14, 2007, in the United States and Canada. It opened to the largest-ever box office (not adjusted for inflation) for a non-Christmas film released in the U.S. in December and was the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2007, earning $256 million domestically and $329 million internationally for a total of $585 million. The film received generally positive reviews, with Smith's performance being singled out for praise, while criticism focused on its divergences from the novel, particularly the ending. In 2022, a sequel was revealed to be in development, with Smith set to reprise his role as Neville and co-produce the film with Michael B. Jordan, who will also have a starring role. ==Plot== An attempt to genetically re-engineer the measles virus to cure cancer becomes lethal, infecting 99% of the world's population, turning those it does not kill into vampiric, albino, cannibalistic mutants called Darkseekers, who are extremely vulnerable to sunlight and prey on the few who are left unaffected. Three years after the outbreak, in 2012, U.S. Army virologist LTC Robert Neville lives an isolated life in deserted Manhattan, unsure if any other uninfected humans are left. Neville's daily routine includes experimenting on infected rats to find a cure for the virus, searching for food and supplies, and waiting each day for any survivors who might respond to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which instruct them to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. Flashbacks reveal his wife, Zoe, and daughter, Marley, died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan as the military was enforcing a quarantine of the island. Neville himself stayed behind with other military personnel. Neville's only companion is his German Shepherd Samantha (Sam) and to cope with his loneliness, he regularly "talks" to some mannequins and the characters on film recordings from video stores. At night, he barricades himself with Sam inside his heavily fortified Washington Square Park home to hide from the Darkseekers. One day as Neville hunts a deer, Sam pursues it into a dark building. Neville cautiously goes in after her and locates the deer's corpse along with Sam, but discovers the building is infested with Darkseekers. Both escape unharmed and the attacking Darkseekers are killed by the sunlight. Neville finds a promising treatment derived from his own blood, so he sets a snare trap and captures a female Darkseeker. A male Darkseeker attempts to pursue them but is halted by the sunlight and returns to the shadows. Back in his laboratory in the basement of his house, Neville treats the female seemingly without success. The next day, Neville notices "Fred", a mannequin usually at the local video store, positioned outside Grand Central Terminal and shoots him in confusion. However, Neville realizes he is being watched by the Darkseekers from within nearby buildings. As he approaches Fred's body, he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the female (set by the Darkseekers) and is rendered unconscious after hitting his head. By the time he wakes up the sun is setting and he is attacked by infected dogs. Neville and Sam eliminate them, but Sam is bitten during the fight. Neville injects her with a strand of his serum, but when she shows signs of infection, Neville is forced to strangle her to death as she begins to turn. Heartbroken and driven by rage, Neville ventures out and deliberately attacks a group of Darkseekers the following night, before he is rescued by a pair of immune humans, Anna and a young boy named Ethan, who have traveled from Maryland after hearing his broadcast. They transport the injured Neville back to his home, where Anna explains they survived the outbreak aboard a Red Cross evacuation ship from São Paulo, and are making their way to a survivors' camp in Bethel, Vermont. Neville argues no such survivors' camp exists. As he continues working to cure the female Darkseeker, Neville theorizes by lowering her body temperature with ice, he can increase the treatment's potency. The next night, a group of Darkseekers, who tracked Anna and Neville the night before, invade the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory sealing themselves in with the female test subject. ===Theatrical ending=== As the Darkseekers attack the lab, discovering the last treatment was successful, Neville assesses the situation as the Darkseeker alpha male rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured, and gives it to Anna, before shutting Ethan and her inside a coal chute in the back of the lab. Neville then kills both himself and the attacking Darkseekers with a grenade, saving the cure. The following day, Anna and Ethan arrive at the survivors' camp in Bethel, where they are greeted by military officers and other survivors before Anna hands them the cure. Anna narrates how Neville's efforts and sacrifices to save humanity ultimately became legend. ===Alternate ending=== As the Darkseekers attack the lab, the alpha male Darkseeker creates a butterfly shape while attempting to break through the glass to the laboratory. Neville realizes it is referencing the butterfly-shaped tattoo on the female Darkseeker's neck and the alpha male and his followers have simply been trying to recover his mate. Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. Neville and the alpha male stare each other down and Neville apologizes after seeing the latter emotionally respond to his mate's return. The alpha male departs with the rest of the pack. Once they are gone, a shocked Neville looks over at the many pictures of his test subjects and realizes he has become a monster in the eyes of the infected, showing remorse for the experiments he has undertaken over the years. The next morning, Neville abandons his research and heads along with Anna and Ethan to Vermont as a changed man, in the hope of finding the survivors' colony. They cross the George Washington Bridge, while Anna delivers a hopeful monologue ending with the statement: "You are not alone." While initially released as a book-accurate alternate ending on the two-disc special edition DVD of I Am Legend in 2008, the "alternate" ending was removed from the theatrical cut due to negative response from initial test screening audiences,Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine: in February 2023, it was confirmed that the sequel to I Am Legend would consider this ending to be the canonical one, with Will Smith reprising his role as Dr. Robert Neville, as he resumes his experiments on the Darkseekers. ==Cast== * Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville * Alice Braga as Anna * Charlie Tahan as Ethan * Dash Mihok as Alpha Male * Emma Thompson as Dr. Alice Krippin * Salli Richardson as Zoe Neville * Willow Smith as Marley Neville * Joanna Numata as Alpha Female * Darrell Foster as Mike * Pat Fraley as voice of the President of the United States * Mike Patton as voices of the Darkseekers Additionally, Neville's pet German Shepherd Samantha ("Sam") is portrayed by Abbey and Kona. ==Production== ===Development=== The science-fiction horror genre reemerged in the late 1990s. In 1995, Warner Bros. began developing the film project, having owned the rights to Richard Matheson's 1954 novel I Am Legend since 1970 and having already made the 1971 adaptation The Omega Man. Mark Protosevich was hired to write the script after the studio was impressed with his spec script of The Cell. Protosevich's first draft took place in 2000 in San Francisco, and contained many similarities with the finished film, though the Darkseekers (called 'Hemocytes') were civilized to the point of the creatures in The Omega Man and Anna was a lone morphine addict, as well as the fact that a Hemocyte character named Christopher joined forces with Neville. Warner Bros. immediately put the film on the fast track, attaching Neal H. Moritz as producer. Actors Tom Cruise, Michael Douglas, and Mel Gibson had been considered to star in the film, Alt URL using a script by Protosevich and with Ridley Scott as director; however, by June 1997, the studio's preference was for actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In July, Scott and Schwarzenegger finalized negotiations, with production slated to begin the coming September, using Houston as a stand-in for the film's setting of Los Angeles. Scott had Protosevich replaced by a screenwriter of his own choosing, John Logan, with whom he spent months of intensive work on a number of different drafts. The Scott–Logan version of I Am Legend was a mix of sci-fi and psychological thriller, without dialogue in the first hour and with a sombre ending. The creatures in Logan's version were similar to the Darkseekers of the finished film in their animalistic, barbaric nature. The studio, fearing its lack of commercial appeal and merchandising potential, began to worry about the liberties they had given Scott – then on a negative streak of box office disappointments – and urged the production team to reconsider the lack of action in the screenplay. After an "esoteric" draft by writer Neal Jimenez, Warner Bros. reassigned Protosevich to the project, reluctantly working with Scott again. In December 1997, the project was called into question when the projected budget escalated to $108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big-budget film. Scott rewrote the script to reduce the film's budget by $20 million but in March 1998, the studio canceled the project due to budgetary concerns and quite possibly to the box office failures of Scott's last three films, 1492: Conquest of Paradise, White Squall, and G.I. Jane. Schwarzenegger's recent films (Eraser and Warner Bros. own Batman & Robin) also underperformed, and the studio's latest experiences with big budget sci-fi movies Sphere and The Postman were negative as well. In August 1998, director Rob Bowman was attached to the project, with Protosevich hired to write a third new draft, far more action-oriented than his previous versions but the director (who reportedly wished for Nicolas Cage to play the lead) moved on to direct Reign of Fire and the project did not get off the ground. In March 2002, Schwarzenegger became the producer of I Am Legend, commencing negotiations with Michael Bay to direct and Will Smith to star in the film. Bay and Smith were attracted to the project based on a redraft that would reduce its budget. The project was shelved due to Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn's dislike of the script. In 2004, Akiva Goldsman was asked by head of production Jeff Robinov to produce the film. In September 2005, director Francis Lawrence signed on to helm the project, with production slated to begin in 2006. Guillermo del Toro was originally approached to direct by Smith, but turned it down to direct Hellboy II: The Golden Army. Lawrence, whose film Constantine was produced by Goldsman, was fascinated by empty urban environments. He said, "Something's always really excited me about that... to have experienced that much loss, to be without people or any kind of social interaction for that long." Goldsman took on the project, as he admired the second I Am Legend film adaptation, The Omega Man. A rewrite was done to distance the project from the other zombie films inspired by the novel, as well as from the recently released 28 Days Later, although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted London in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City. A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith's film Hancock, which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor's films. This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks; production was given a green light, using Goldsman's script and the outline. Elements from Protosevich's script were introduced, while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement. Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith's improvisational skills and Lawrence's preference to keep various scenes silent. The director had watched Jane Campion's film The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son and realized that silence could be very effective cinema. ===Casting=== Will Smith signed on to play Robert Neville in April 2006. He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like "Gladiator [or] Forrest Gump—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. [This] always felt like it had those possibilities to me." The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that "when you're on your own, it is kind of hard to find conflict." The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes. To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, "Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?" He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks' performance in Cast Away (2000). Abbey and Kona, both three-year-old German Shepherd dogs, played Neville's dog Sam. The rest of the supporting cast consists of Salli Richardson as Zoe, Robert's wife, and Alice Braga as a survivor named Anna. Willow Smith, Will Smith's daughter, makes her film debut as Marley, Neville's daughter. Emma Thompson has an uncredited role as Dr. Alice Krippin, who appears on television explaining her cure for cancer that mutates into the virus. Singer Mike Patton provided the guttural screams of the infected "hemocytes", and Dash Mihok provided the character animation for the infected "alpha male". Several filler characters with uncredited roles were in old news broadcasts and flashbacks, such as the unnamed President's voice (Pat Fraley), and the cast of The Today Show. ===Filming=== thumb|upright|Marcy Avenue Armory Akiva Goldsman decided to move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take advantage of locations that would more easily show emptiness. Goldsman explained, "L.A. looks empty at three o'clock in the afternoon, [but] New York is never empty . . . it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world." Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics, but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder, and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives. Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct, several blocks of Fifth Avenue, and Washington Square Park. The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format, with flashback scenes shot in Super 35. Filming began on September 23, 2006. The Marcy Avenue Armory in Williamsburg was used for the interior of Neville's home, while Greenwich Village was used for the exterior. Other locations include the Tribeca section of lower Manhattan, the aircraft carrier Intrepid, the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Weeds were imported from Florida and were strewn across locations to make the city look like it had been overgrown with them. The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers. Will Smith said, "I don't think anyone's going to be able to do that in New York again anytime soon. People were not happy. That's the most middle fingers I've ever gotten in my career." A bridge scene was filmed for six consecutive nights in January on the Brooklyn Bridge to serve as a flashback scene in which New York's citizens evacuate the city. Shooting the scene consumed $5 million of the film's reported $150 million budget, which was likely the most expensive shoot in the city to date. The scene, which had to meet requirements from 14 government agencies, involved 250 crew members and 1,000 extras, including 160 National Guard members. Also present were several Humvees, three Strykers, a cutter, a utility boat, and two response boat small craft, as well as other vehicles including taxis, police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances. Filming concluded on March 31, 2007. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used to depict the main spans of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge collapsing as missiles from passing military jets blew them up to quarantine Manhattan island. The end of the film was shot in Lambertville, New Jersey. Reshoots were conducted around November 2007. Lawrence noted, "We weren't seeing fully rendered shots until about a month ago. The movie starts to take on a whole other life. It's not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go, 'Huh, maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle, or tweak this a little bit.' It just so happened that our re-shoots revolved around the end of the movie." ===Effects=== A week into filming, Lawrence felt the infected (referred to as "Darkseekers" or "hemocytes" in the script), who were being portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use CGI resulted in an increased budget and extended post-production, although the end results were not always well received. The concept behind the infected was that their adrenal glands were open all of the time, and Lawrence explained: The actors remained on set to provide motion capture. "The film's producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human, but not the standard", so Mike Patton, lead singer of Faith No More, was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected. In addition, CGI was used for the lions and deer in the film, and to erase pedestrians in shots of New York. Workers visible in windows, spectators, and moving cars in the distance were all removed. In his vision of an empty New York, Lawrence cited John Ford as his influence: ==Music== The soundtrack for I Am Legend was released on January 15, 2008, under the record label Varèse Sarabande. The music was composed by James Newton Howard. The film also features Bob Marley songs "Redemption Song", "Three Little Birds", "Buffalo Soldier" and "Stir It Up". Marley is also discussed in the film, and Neville's daughter is named after him. ==Release== ===Theatrical=== I Am Legend was originally slated for a November 21, 2007, release in the United States and Canada, but was delayed to December 14. The film opened on December 26, 2007, in the United Kingdom, and Ireland, having been originally scheduled for January 4, 2008. In December 2007, China temporarily suspended the release of all American films in the country, which is believed to have delayed the release of I Am Legend. Will Smith spoke to the chairman of China Film Group about securing a release date, later explaining, "We struggled very, very hard to try to get it to work out, but there are only a certain amount of foreign films that are allowed in." Premieres were held in Tokyo, New York, and London. At the London premiere in Leicester Square, British comedian and actor Neg Dupree was arrested after pushing his way onto the red carpet and running around shouting "I am Negend!". Neg Dupree Red Carpet Run The stunt was part of his "Neg's Urban Sports" section of comedy game show Balls of Steel. ===Marketing=== The film's teaser trailer was attached to the screenings of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. And a tie-in comic from DC Comics and Vertigo Comics was created, I Am Legend: Awakening. The project drew upon collaboration from Bill Sienkiewicz, screenwriter Mark Protosevich, and author Orson Scott Card. The son of the original book's author, Richard Christian Matheson, also collaborated on the project. The project advanced from the comic to an online format in which animated featurettes (created by the team from Broken Saints) were shown on the official website. In October 2007, Warner Bros. Pictures, in conjunction with the Electric Sheep Company, launched the online multiplayer game I Am Legend: Survival in the virtual world Second Life. The game was the largest launched in the virtual world in support of a film release, permitting people to play against each other as the infected or the uninfected across a replicated of New York City. The studio also hired the ad agency Crew Creative to develop a website that was specifically viewable on the iPhone. ===Home media=== The film was released on DVD on March 18, 2008, in two editions: a one-disc release, including the movie with four animated comics ("Death As a Gift", "Isolation", "Sacrificing the Few for the Many", and "Shelter"), and other DVD-ROM features, and a two-disc special edition that includes all these extras, an alternative theatrical version of the movie with an ending that follows closer to that from the novel, and a digital copy of the film. On the high-definition end, the movie has been released on the Blu-ray Disc format and HD DVD format along with the DVD release, with the HD-DVD version being released later on April 8, 2008. Both HD releases include all the features available in the two-disc DVD edition. A three-disk Ultimate Collector's Edition was also released on December 9, 2008. The film has sold 7.04 million DVDs and earned $126.2 million in revenue, making it the sixth-best-selling DVD of 2008. However, Warner Bros. was reportedly "a little disappointed" with the film's performance on the DVD market. ==Reception== ===Box office=== I Am Legend collected $77.2 million during its opening weekend, ranking in first place at the box office above Alvin and the Chipmunks. It surpassed The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King to have the highest December opening weekend. That record would be surpassed by The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey five years later in 2012. The film grossed $256 million domestically and $329 million internationally, increasing the total gross to $585.4 million. ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 68% based on 217 reviews with an average rating of 6.34/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "I Am Legend overcomes questionable special effects and succeeds largely on the strength of Will Smith's mesmerizing performance." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale. A. O. Scott wrote that Will Smith gave a "graceful and effortless performance" and also noted the "third-act collapse". He felt that the movie "does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization". Dana Stevens of Slate wrote that the movie lost its way around the hour mark, noting that "the Infected just aren't that scary." NPR critic Bob Mondello noted the film's subtext concerning global terrorism and that this aspect made the film fit in perfectly with other, more direct cinematic explorations of the subject. Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper, commending Will Smith as being in "prime form", also saying there are "some amazing sequences" and that there was "a pretty heavy screenplay for an action film." In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing, "Given its setup, I Am Legend is well-constructed to involve us with Dr. Neville and his campaign to survive." The film has been criticized for diverging from Matheson's novel, especially in its portrayal of a specifically Christian theme. Much of the negative criticism concerned the film's third act, with some critics favoring the alternative ending in the DVD release. ===Other response=== Popular Mechanics published an article on December 14, 2007, addressing some of the scientific issues raised by the film: # the rate of deterioration of urban structures, infrastructure, and survival of fauna and flora # the plausibility of a retrovirus spreading out of control as depicted in the film (The measles virus depicted in the film is not a retrovirus, but is in fact a part of the Paramyxovirus family.) # the mechanics of the Brooklyn Bridge's destruction The magazine solicited reactions from Alan Weisman, author of The World Without Us, virologist W. Ian Lipkin, MD, and Michel Bruneau, PhD, comparing their predictions with the film's depictions. The article raised the most questions regarding the virus' mutation and the medical results, and pointed out that a suspension bridge like the Brooklyn Bridge would likely completely collapse rather than losing only its middle span. Neville's method of producing power using gasoline- powered generators seemed the most credible: "This part of the tale is possible, if not entirely likely," Popular Mechanics editor Roy Berendsohn says. Marxist philosopher Slavoj Žižek criticized the film politically for, in his view, "being the most regressive adaptation from the novel." He said that while the original novel had a "progressive multicultural message" where Neville became a "legend" to the new creatures and is subsequently killed by them (much like vampire were legends to humans), the 2007 film finds a cure for the Darkseekers and it is delivered by a survivor through "divine intervention". For Žižek, this misses the original message and "openly opt[s] for religious fundamentalism." ===Accolades=== I Am Legend earned four nominations for the Visual Effects Society awards, and was also nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, Outstanding Film and Actor at the Image Awards, and Best Sound at the Satellite Awards. In June 2008, Will Smith won a Saturn Award for Best Actor. Will Smith also won the MTV Movie Awards for Best Male Performance. == Sequel == Director Francis Lawrence said in 2008 that there would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role. The plot of the film would reveal what happened to Neville before the infected took over New York. D. B. Weiss was hired to write the script, while Lawrence was in negotiations to return as director, contingent on a sufficiently interesting story. Smith later discussed the premise, which would have his character and a team going from New York City to Washington, D.C., as they made their last stand against those infected with the virus. The film would again explore the premise of being alone. Lawrence stated, "... the tough thing is, how do we do that again and in a different way?" In May 2011, Lawrence stated that the prequel was no longer in development saying, "I don't think that's ever going to happen." In 2012, Warner Bros. announced that negotiations had begun to produce another installment with the intention of having Smith reprise his role. In April 2014, the studio acquired a script entitled A Garden at the End of the World, described as a post-apocalyptic variation of The Searchers. Studio executives found so many similarities to I Am Legend in the screenplay, they had the author Gary Graham rewrite it so it could serve as a reboot of the story, hoping to create a franchise with the new film. By 2014, Smith, who is known for his reluctance to appear in sequels, had not commented on whether he would appear. On March 4, 2022, a sequel was officially announced as in development, with Will Smith reprising his role and Michael B. Jordan set to star, and both producing. Akiva Goldsman would also return to write the screenplay. The film will take place after its predecessor's alternate ending, rather than the original. ==Bibliography== * I Am Legend, Richard Matheson, Tor Books; Reissue edition (October 30, 2007), ==See also== * Survival film: information regarding the genre, with a list of feature films therein. * Medical-fiction film * Disaster film ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:2007 films Category:2000s action horror films Category:2007 action thriller films Category:2007 science fiction action films Category:2000s science fiction horror films Category:2000s monster movies Category:2000s American films Category:American action horror films Category:American action thriller films Category:American science fiction action films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:American science fiction thriller films Category:American survival films Category:American post-apocalyptic films Category:American vampire films Category:Films about viral outbreaks Category:Films using motion capture Category:Films set in 2009 Category:Films set in 2012 Category:Films set in the future Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Films based on American horror novels Category:Films based on works by Richard Matheson Category:Films based on science fiction novels Category:Films directed by Francis Lawrence Category:Films produced by Akiva Goldsman Category:Films produced by Neal H.

66587575	I Am God (novel)	I Am God, originally published as Sono Dio, is an Italian novel by Giacomo Sartori about the Islamo-Christian God falling in love with a mortal woman. First published in 2016 and translated into English by Frederika Randall in 2019, it was a critical and commercial success. ==Plot== I Am God opens with God beginning to keep a journal about his view on modern society, and in particular his infatuation with Daphne, a young geneticist. Daphne, an atheist post-punk and anti-Catholic activist, attracts God's attention although he fails to understand why. Much of the book is epistolary, with God as a first- person narrator through his journal, discussing his thoughts on a humanity he finds unsatisfying; language is recent to him, as the God of the novel has mostly disclaimed and damned humanity on the basis of thinking human language and thought to be evil. The plot also features a love triangle between Daphne, God, and her mortal boyfriend Giovanni, an alcoholic and sexually uninhibited paleontologist. The God of I Am God has been characterized as neurotic, garrulous, and overly verbose. He also holds conservative views on matters of gender and sexuality, being called "half heteronormative deity, half embarrassing uncle" by Martin Riker of The New York Times. ==Reception== I Am God received mostly positive reviews. Michael Alec Rose of BookPage described the novel as "delightful, strikingly current, [and] infectiously readable" and compared Sartori to great historical Italian religious artists such as Michelangelo and Dante Alighieri, saying "in his modest and profound way, Sartori belongs in this terrific company". R. P. Finch of The Philadelphia Inquirer called it "a pleasure to read", but criticized the plot for being overly complex, while Publishers Weekly referred to it as "an immensely satisfying feat of imagination". James Livingston of The New Republic wrote a particularly in-depth review, interpreting I Am God as a meditation on the human focus on death and mortality, concepts alien to an immortal deity. Kirkus Reviews and The New York Times both gave more mixed reviews. Kirkus criticized the book for lacking sharpness and for what it interpreted as homophobic content, while The New York Times, while overall positive, found the characters to be overly simplistic and the humour perhaps weakened by translation. Italian reviewers were also positive about Sono Dio, the original Italian novel. Gabriele Sabatini of Flaneri praised the novel for its sense of spirit and vigour, while Stefano Zangrando of L'Indice dei libri del mese endorsed the humour and prose. ==See also== *Portrayals of God in popular media ==References== Category:2016 novels Category:21st-century Italian novels Category:Epistolary novels Category:Italian satirical novels Category:2010s speculative fiction novels Category:God in popular culture
6685128	I Am (American band)	I Am (often stylized as I AM) was an alternative progressive rock band formed in Las Vegas in 1995 and disbanded the same year. The rhythm section of the defunct band Shatterbone created the group and released an album in 1995. The band featured Greg Greer on vocals, Rod Arnett on bass, Dan Ryan on guitar, and video game music composer Frank Klepacki on drums. == There's a Home == Their first and only album, There's a Home (1995), featured thirteen original tracks (one hidden) drawing influences from Tool and Soundgarden.There's a Home, I Am. U Call It Productions, 1995. The hidden thirteenth track, "I will...", simply features a man reciting self-help instructions and a humorous mantra — "the louder the apartment, the happier I will be." The eleventh track, Destructible Times, was used the same year in the video game Command & Conquer, specifically in the credits for the Brotherhood of Nod faction. Developers at Westwood Studios requested the song's use because it "reflected the war aspect and bad-ass vibe of [Nod's] side." The band was once recorded live while performing this song.

67035082	I Am Real	"I Am Real" is the debut single by Australian hotelier Simon van Kempen. It was released on 21 April 2011, through JSM Music, during his wife Alex McCord's tenure on the American reality television series The Real Housewives of New York City. The song was written by Allison Beth Simon, Jon Jason Appleton, and Koki Saito, while production was handled by Joel Simon, Ross Hopman, and Saito. During its development, van Kempen and McCord met with the team of writers to ensure that the song's lyrics would represent them accurately. A dance-pop and EDM track, "I Am Real" contains tongue-in-cheek lyrics that address van Kempen's critics. One lyric references a comment McCord used to describe fellow cast member Luann de Lesseps. "I Am Real" received mostly unfavourable reviews from music critics, who dismissed van Kempen as a television personality who tried launching a singing career. It also received comparisons to "Money Can't Buy You Class" (2010) by de Lesseps. The song was unsuccessful, selling just 1,000 copies in the United States, as of September 2011. van Kempen has since performed "I Am Real" on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen and at Manhattan's annual "Fashion Night Out" event in 2011. == Background and release == "I Am Real" is the first and only song recorded by Simon van Kempen, an Australian hotelier and husband of American television personality Alex McCord, of Bravo's The Real Housewives of New York City. Regarding its unexpected release, van Kempen explained that he had grown up with a musical background, and spent time in his youth performing as a musician. He did not write the song, but still wanted it to reflect his thoughts and feelings. It was written by Allison Beth Simon, Jon Jason Appleton, and Koki Saito, while production was handled by Joel Simon, Ross Hopman, and Saito. According to McCord, the two sat down with Joel Simon to discuss the song's lyrics and ensure that it would represent them accurately; the writers would draft lyrics and then return to McCord and van Kempen to seek approval. van Kempen explained that he would not have recorded the song if it were not for The Real Housewives of New York City, for which McCord was a cast member, and his resulting notoriety. He recorded the song on 31 March 2011, at JSM Music Studios in New York City. van Kempen and McCord refrained from discussing details of the song until its release date, in order to drop it as a surprise for fans. The song was released for digital download and streaming in various countries on 21 April 2011, through JSM Music. van Kempen and the label worked with the independent music distributor CD Baby to launch the release. JSM Music typically creates music for advertisements and commercials. A remix of the song, called the Thug in a Club mix, was released separately in the same formats on 12 May 2011. == Composition and lyrics == "I Am Real" is a dance-pop and EDM song with tongue-in-cheek and playful lyrics. Self-described as a "cheeky" and "self-deprecating" song influenced by the music of the 1980s, van Kempen said that it "takes the piss out of reality TV". Rich Juzwiak from TV Guide Magazine labelled it as a "thumping wanabe club anthem," calling it the opposite of "Tardy for the Party" (2009), by The Real Housewives of Atlanta cast member Kim Zolciak. He also expressed that the lack of Auto-Tune was refreshing, despite a critic from Yahoo! Entertainment referring to the song as "Auto-tuned awfulness". Mike Barthel from The Awl said that he sings in a mid-range voice on top of a lower-pitched production, which he felt was something different for a dance and EDM track. The song discusses van Kempen's "haters", his views on class, and how he handles criticism. It features lyrics such as "Love me or hate me / I don't give a damn!" and "I am real / I ain't going to change". It also discusses what he experienced during the filming of The Real Housewives of New York City, such as his friendships and indifferences with the other cast members: "When wives attack behind my back / They trash me on their Twitter." According to van Kempen, some members accused him of being a gay man, despite his marriage to McCord, and was "get[ting] sick after four years" of the rumours. "I Am Real" also features a "now infamous one-liner" that McCord originally said on the series ("Thug in a cocktail dress"), in reference to fellow housewife Luann de Lesseps. == Reception and promotion == Peoples Dave Quinn ranked "I Am Real" as the worst song in The Real Housewives franchise, explaining that given van Kempen's multiple appearances on the show, the release of his music "shouldn't have been too much of a shock". Pamela Sitt from MTV News compared the song to Kim Zolciak's 2010 single "Google Me", suggesting that "I Am Real" might be just as bad. A Yahoo! Entertainment critic called it "so bad", preferring de Lesseps' "Money Can't Buy You Class" (2010) and equating their listening of the song to eating "really disgusting food". Amanda Dobbins, of Vulture, provided a lukewarm review: "We can say this much: The song does rhyme, and it does appear to be factually correct (in that Simon is a real person)." Eliot Glazer from MTV News blamed "Money Can't Buy You Class" for allowing van Kempen to believe "that he, too, could – and should – record a song". Also in reference to "Money Can't Buy You Class", several staff members from E! Online described "I Am Real" as "an even more ridiculous song"; they also labelled van Kempen as a television personality who "thinks he has what it takes to be a pop star". Juzwiak referred to it as "yet another musical punch line that, whether it's aware of it or not, underlines how delusional the extreme personalities that populate reality TV are". However, Barthel called it one of the better Real Housewives singles due to it being a "total one-off". In September 2011, The Hollywood Reporter reported that "I Am Real" was the second lowest-performing The Real Housewives-related single, with approximate sales of just 1,000 digital copies in the United States. McCord premiered a snippet of the song during the episode of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen broadcast on 21 April 2011. van Kempen later appeared on the show to perform "I Am Real" live. Andy Cohen, host of the show, later referenced the clip as "the worst musical performance" by a former series cast member. van Kempen also performed the song at Manhattan's annual "Fashion Night Out" event in 2011. The development and impact of "I Am Real" was discussed in the 2017 web series Throwback Bravo, which documented popular moments from Bravo series. == Track listings == == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from the official press release for "I Am Real". * Simon van Kempenperformer * Koki Saitocomposer, producer * Jon Jason Appletoncomposer * Allison Beth Simoncomposer * Ross Hopmanproducer * Joel Simonproducer * Rob Goldstoneexecutive producer * Alex McCordexecutive producer == Release history == Release dates and formats for "I Am Real" Region Date Format(s) Version Label Various 21 April 2011 Original JSM Music References regarding the release of "I Am Real" by Simon van Kempen on Apple Music: * * * * * 12 May 2011 Thug in a Club mix References regarding the release of "I Am Real (Thug in a Club Mix)" by Simon van Kempen on Apple Music: * * * * * == References == == External links == * "I Am Real" website at simonvankempen.com Category:2011 debut singles Category:2011 songs Category:Australian dance-pop songs Category:Australian electronic dance music songs Category:Diss tracks Category:The Real Housewives

67382978	I Can See an Angel	"I Can See an Angel" is a song written by Kay Adelman that was first recorded by American country singer Patsy Cline. It was released as a single in 1958 via Decca Records and was produced by Owen Bradley. The song was among several singles Cline released with the Decca label during the late 1950s which did not chart any major music publications. ==Background and content== Patsy Cline had first signed with Four Star Records and released multiple singles. However, only the song "Walkin' After Midnight" proved to be a hit when it reached number two on the country chart and crossed over to the pop music chart. Following this, Cline recorded a variety of material for the Four Star label, ranging from traditional pop to Rockabilly. Four Star executives Paul Cohen and Bill McCall still believed she could have another hit if the right song was found. For these reasons, Cline was sent into the recording studio on February 13, 1958 in Nashville, Tennessee. Under the production of Owen Bradley, several songs were recorded that day including the track "I Can See an Angel." The song was composed by Kay Adelman. ==Release and reception== On August 18, 1958, "I Can See an Angel" was released via Decca Records. It was backed on the B-side by the track "Never No More." Like previous release, Four Star leased its music to the Decca label based on a decision made by Paul Cohen in 1956. "I Can See an Angel" was not successful following its single release. Singles that followed from Four Star yielded similar results through 1960. Biographer Ellis Nassour gave "I Can See an Angel" a negative response in his biography of Cline's life, calling the track "nothing exciting." In reviewing a compilation of Cline's Richie Unterberger of AllMusic grouped "I Can See an Angel" into a category with other songs she cut during the same era. Unterberger noted that the track hinted at better quality music that she would later record in the 1960s: "With some more work and better material, the prototype would pay big dividends just a year or two down the road," he concluded. ==Track listing== 7" vinyl single * "I Can See an Angel" – 2:20 * "Never No More" – 2:33 ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Books=== * Category:1958 singles Category:Decca Records singles Category:Patsy Cline songs Category:Song recordings produced by Owen Bradley

On December 31, (G)I-dle revealed the album's track-list on their social media. On January 2, 2021, the concept preview video of the album was released. On January 6, the group released the highlight medley for their new album. On January 11, the group held an online media showcase for the release of I Burn hosted by broadcaster Oh Jung-yeon, who appeared in I'm a Survivor with Yuqi. During the showcase, Yuqi described the intro song "Hann (Alone in Winter)" as a song that connects with the digital single "Hann (Alone)" and the title song "Hwaa". "It's similar to "Hann" but it gives a different feel to it." ==Music and lyrics== Members Minnie, Soyeon and Yuqi participated in the composing and writing of I Burn. (G)I-dle explained that I Burn is about various emotions felt in the process of regaining happiness after separation. "Hann (Alone in Winter)" represents the cold aftermath of a breakup; "Hwaa" is about getting over a heartbreaking farewell; "Moon" touches on the desire to hide one's feelings; and "Where is Love" explores the emptiness of love. "Hann (Alone in Winter)" is a song composed, written and arranged by Soyeon and Ahn Ye-eun. It tells the change of feelings as winter comes from the lonely being alone through betrayal and separation. Minnie, who is in charge of composing "Moon" described that the song contains honest feelings that cannot be shown to others. "I personally cherish it so much." The song was composed by Minnie with the thought of the Moon. Regarding "Dahlia", Minnie explained that the song depicts two opposite meanings; greed and attraction. "It's a song that I studied hard and wrote the lyrics to see if I can express the flowers beautifully." The songs were arranged based on the stories in the lyrics. Minnie explained, "there is a sense of connectivity from the first track through the last track. That's why the story of getting burned by a breakup and then growing into something stronger is easy to follow throughout I burn. It begins with "Hann (Alone in Winter)" — a song about separation — and ends with "Dahlia" — an uplifting track named after a flower." ===Songs=== The opening track, "Hann (Alone in Winter)" is a medium-tempo ballad that connects the group's 2018 single "Hann" with the album's title track "Hwaa". The second song, "Hwaa" is a moombahton song that adds a cool sensibility to an oriental musical instrument. "Moon", the third song is a pop track about honest feelings. "Where is love" is a disco retro styled dance song with a funky bass. The song is about feelings after parting. "Lost", the fifth song, is a R&B; song. The closing track, "Dahlia", is a medium pop genre song with the theme of a flower Dahlia. ==Critical reception== Gab Ginsberg and Jason Lipshutz writing for Billboard describe "Dahlia" as "[a] riveting garden that is "Dahlia", where Miyeon, Minnie, Soojin, Soyeon, Yuqi and Shuhua sing about a love that can't be tainted by outsider critics. Oh Jung-yeon praised (G)I-dle for their songwriting and stated, "Listening to the explanation of the philosophy and emotions of the six members melted into each song, I suddenly wanted to call them 'teachers'." Heran Mamo from Billboard, regarded the album as, "together musical arrangements and Eastern instrumentation to collect the pieces of a broken heart, as I burn describes the aftermath of a painful breakup through the motif of a blazing fire and the sequential triumph like a blooming flower." Michele Mendez of Elite Daily affirmed that I Burn is "the breakup album everyone needs to hear because it's a reminder something beautiful can emerge from darkness." Writing for The Quietus online publication, Verónica A. Bastardo remarked: "A theatrical extended player, flooded with grandiloquent orchestral instrumentals mixed with pop structures and EDM drops, that explores in a metaphorical way the path of regaining happiness and strength after the separation from a loved one." Writing for Beats Per Minute, JT Early gave the album a score of 75/100, describing the material as "surprising and emotional project from a girl-group who have sheathed their sharpness to start repairing their internal hurt" [...] "further established them as one of the most versatile girl-groups in the industry". In the review, the author emphasize that "these songs are self-produced and self-written by the members themselves, as their output has been for years." and concluded "by wholly committing to this concept of defeat and resurrection, they have created a project that is not only relatable and inspiring to listeners, but also an exercise in transparency from the group itself." The Kraze magazine gave the album a rating of 7.5/10 points and overall score including lead single and music video of 8.6/10 points, praising the production work by Soyeon, Minnie and Yuqi and the member's unique vocal colours.

67799423	I Am No Messiah	I Am No Messiah is a memoir written by Indian actor and social worker Sonu Sood, and co-written by Meena Iyer. The book was first released in December 2020 by Penguin publishers. In 2020, Sonu Sood, during the COVID-19 lockdown in India, helped thousands of stranded migrant workers, students etc. to return home, and was dubbed as "Messiah of migrants" for his work. In this autobiographical book he chronicled his experiences, and also narrated his journey from Moga to Mumbai, and his struggle in Bollywood and in South India to become an actor. == Synopsis == In this book Sonu Sood narrates his journey from being an actor to a dedicated and altruistic social worker. In this book, he narrates the story of his life in details. He was born in a Punjabi family in Moga. He did his schooling in Moga and completed his engineering in Nagpur. After that instead of becoming an engineer he decided to try his luck as an actor. Initially he takes a job in Delhi for a few months. Then he moves to Mumbai and his life as a struggling actor begins. After several years of struggle, he manages to get a break in a Tamil film. After the film became successful gradually he gets offers from Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and later Hindi films. In mid-2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown in India (first wave), Sood helped thousands of stranded Indian migrant workers to reach their homes. He named this mission Ghar Bhejo (). He and his team arranged buses, special trains, and chartered flights to send the migrant labourers. On 15 April 2020, around twenty days after the first lockdown started in India, Sood went to Kalwa Chowk, in Thane to provide food, drinking water, sanitisers etc. to the stranded migrant workers. A few people there asked him if they could be given more than one food packet. After inquiring he quickly understood the reason that the labourers were actually starting their journey of hundreds of kilometers to Karnataka and other states by walk (as there was no other option to travel during the lockdown). At this moment he understood that just handing over food packets, or sanitisers was not enough. That day he could send off 350 people to Karnataka, however there were thousands of others around waiting for help. That's how he started his mission and gradually he rediscovered himself as a humanitarian. He was able to send 12000 migrant workers to their home through his ‘Ghar Bhejo‘ campaign and under his leadership, the Sood Charity Foundation was able to make arrangements for another 45,000 people! As he continues to work on the Ghar Bhejo initiative, he and his team understand there was a lot more work to be done. In the book, he also narrates other initiatives which they started gradually such as helping farmers, or helping poor people to get medical services or to undergo surgeries etc. == Controversy == After the publication of the book, Sonu Sood was trolled for the title of the book. In the first few days, there were many negative reviews on Amazon criticising the book as "ghostwritten". Some others told that Sood was trying to establish himself as a "messiah", although he had no such title officially. Very soon Amazon turned off reviewing option for this book citing "unusual reviewing activity". Sood denied the accusations stating that those were "paid trolls". == References == Category:Indian autobiographies Category:2020 non-fiction books Category:Penguin Books India books
67994367	I Am the Shaman	"I Am the Shaman" is a song written by Scottish singer Donovan. It was originally released on his 2010 album Ritual Groove. The song and its music video were produced by experimental director and musician David Lynch, with whom Donovan has a shared interest in transcendental meditation. The music video was released in celebration of Donovan's 75th birthday on 10 May 2021. ==Recording== Donovan wrote of the collaboration: > He had asked me to only bring in a song just emerging, not anywhere near > finished. We would see what happens. It happened! I composed extempore… the > verses came naturally. New chord patterns effortlessly appeared. The song was recorded in Lynch's Los Angeles studio. While the verses are reflective of the folk music which Donovan has been associated with, the choruses, as with much of the ambient atmosphere, are of a more experimental nature. The instrumentation and lyrics of the chorus were produced by reversing the recording. The song was originally recorded for Donovan's 2010 album Ritual Groove, but the music video was produced eleven years later. > It was all impromptu … I visited the studio and David said, "Sit at the mics > with your guitar Don". David in same room behind control desk with my Linda. > He had asked me to only bring in a song just emerging, not anywhere near > finished. We would see what happens. ==References== Category:Donovan songs Category:Songs written by Donovan Category:2010 songs
67997158	I Am a Lot Like You! Tour	The I Am a Lot Like You! Tour was an international concert tour by American singer St. Vincent, which supported her fifth studio album Masseduction (2017). The tour started on April 5, 2018, in Mexico City, Mexico and concluded on April 7, 2019, in Bogotá, Colombia. The I Am a Lot Like You Tour was a follow-up of the previous Fear the Future Tour, promoting the Masseduction album across the world, but a departure from the one-woman show presented in the last run, since this time there was a live backing band accompanying Clark. The tour comprised mostly summer festivals, but also included some solo concerts and three rescheduled dates from the previous tour. == Set list == This set list is from the April 5, 2019 concert at Lollapalooza in São Paulo, Brazil.

6800879	I Am Changing	"I Am Changing" is a song from the second act of the long-running Broadway musical Dreamgirls. Written by Henry Krieger and Tom Eyen, the song was performed by the character Effie White, originally portrayed on Broadway by Jennifer Holliday. ==History== "I Am Changing" tells the story of a woman who wants to leave behind the mistakes of her past and "change her life"--she sings, "I need you, I need a hand" and "I need a friend to help me start all over again". After the unexpected success of Holliday's first single, "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going", "I Am Changing" was released as the second single from the Dreamgirls cast album. However, the song didn't perform as well as "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going", peaking at #22 on Billboard's Black Singles Chart and failing to chart on Billboard's Pop Singles Chart. ==Cover versions== "I Am Changing" has been covered several times. Whitney Houston performed the song at the 10th Anniversary of Arista Records ceremony in 1984. This performance is included on her 2010 CD/DVD reissue of Whitney Houston – The Deluxe Anniversary Edition. She also performed the song during the duration of her Greatest Love World Tour in 1986 in a slower, soulful version, influenced by gospel music. Ex-Supreme Mary Wilson included it in her album Walk the Line, and in a compilation of her solo singles. Lillias White, who was Holliday's original understudy, has performed the song in concert. Jennifer Hudson performs the song as Effie White in the 2006 DreamWorks/Paramount Dreamgirls motion picture adaptation. The song was performed by Bianca Ryan on the first season of NBC's America's Got Talent, a reality show which Ryan became the winner of that year. The eleven-year-old's performance of "I Am Changing" prompted show judge (and onetime teen star) Brandy to shake her head and proclaim that Ryan "makes me want to go practice … that's how good you are."Mahan, Colin. "Talent shines in finale". tv.com. Retrieved on 20 August 2006. In 2014, the song was performed in the Glee episode "New Directions" by Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley). ==Charts== Chart (1982) Peak position ==References== Category:1981 songs Category:1982 singles Category:Songs from Dreamgirls Category:Jennifer Hudson songs Category:Songs written by Henry Krieger Category:Songs with lyrics by Tom Eyen Category:Song recordings produced by David Foster
68039320	I Am (Toothgrinder album)	I Am is the third studio album by American metalcore band Toothgrinder. The album was released on October 11, 2019 through Spinefarm Records. ==Lyrical themes== Opening track "The Silence of a Sleeping WASP" is a sequel to "The Shadow" from the band's previous album Phantom Amour. Lyrically, the songs deal with Carl Jung's concept of the shadow and how it deals with addiction and alcoholism. The album's title track also deals with themes of addiction, along with depression, anxiety, and co-dependency, among others. ==Reception== I Am polarized critics upon its release. Cryptic Rock gave the album a perfect score of 5/5, calling I Am the band's most complete work to date. Distorted Sound gave the album a highly positive review, praising the album's experimental but accessible sound along with Matthews's emotional lyrics. Zach Buggy of Dead Press! gave the album an overwhelmingly negative review, saying the aggressiveness of Nocturnal Masquerade and the progressiveness of Phantom Amour have been diluted and "boiled down into a melting pot of half-baked ideas" that results in "a bland, accessible mess." Buggy said the band comes off as "a less obnoxious Five Finger Death Punch, or as metal’s answer to Imagine Dragons." Exclaim!'s Max Morin also gave an overwhelmingly negative review, saying the album sounds like every metal song on Sirius XM meshed together, resulting in a sound similar to Shinedown and Bring Me the Horizon. Morin claimed the record was Toothgrinder selling out, getting rid of many of its heavier and experimental elements for a "pop sheen" and "radio-friendly production." Morin did praise the title track for the confessional lyrics of Justin Matthews and for the djent style riff. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Justin Matthews – lead vocals *Johnuel Hasney – lead guitar, backing vocals *Jason Goss – rhythm guitar *Matt Arensdorf – bass, backing vocals *Wills Weller – drums ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Toothgrinder albums Category:Spinefarm Records albums Category:Albums produced by Matt Squire
6818196	I Ching (comics)	I Ching (often spelled I-Ching) is a fictional, blind martial artist published by DC Comics. He first appeared in Wonder Woman #179 (November 1968), and was created by Denny O'Neil and Mike Sekowsky. The character was created to further the editorial plans to reboot Wonder Woman's premise and characters. ==Fictional character biography== ===Pre-Crisis=== I Ching is the last surviving member of an ancient sect, whose monastery was hidden high in the mountains. Their task was to maintain ageless knowledge lost centuries past - a time when men concluded that magic and science are different. Only the sect knew that they are two sides of the same coin. The temple contained several precious gems and metals. Desiring this treasure, Doctor Cyber sent agents to raid the temple. During this attack, all members of the temple were murdered with the sole exception of I Ching, who managed to escape with serious injuries. thumb|left|150px|I Ching trains Diana Prince in Wonder Woman #179. Around this time, Wonder Woman surrendered her powers to remain in "Man's World" rather than accompany her fellow Amazons when they relocated to another dimension so they could "restore their magic." Now a mod boutique owner, the powerless Diana Prince acquired I Ching as her mentor. Under I Ching's guidance, Diana trained her body as a weapon, learned martial arts and weapons skills, and undertook adventures that encompassed a variety of genres, from espionage to mythology. It is also revealed that I Ching has a daughter, Lu Shan. I Ching and Diana subsequently help Superman to defeat a malignant other-dimensional duplicate known as the "Sand Superman" in The Sandman Saga (Superman #240-242). Wonder Woman's powers and traditional costume were restored in 1973 (issue #204). The issue begins with a lunatic sniper gunning down innocent passersby from his rooftop vantage point. A newly married couple driving to their honeymoon destination are among the fatalities and their car crashes into a nearby restaurant where Diana Prince and her mentor I Ching are dining. During the chaos, the sniper fires again and this time he kills I Ching, who dies in the arms of a distraught Diana. ===Post-Crisis/"One Year Later"=== In Justice League of America #0, Wonder Woman is shown in her white "Diana Prince" outfit during a flashback. It is unknown if her time as a powerless adventurer has been restored in her history, or if I Ching was her mentor. Later, in Wonder Woman #2, photos are obtained of Wonder Woman training with an Eastern mystic code-named I Ching. In the photos (presumably obtained during the one-year gap), Wonder Woman is in her white "Diana Prince" outfit. In Detective Comics #838, Robin (vol. 2) #169, and Nightwing (vol. 2) #139, I Ching works with Batman against Ra's al Ghul, ultimately involving himself in Robin and Nightwing's conflict regarding the Lazarus Pit. I Ching returns to help Batman and Robin defeat Sensei in Batman #705-707. ===DC Rebirth=== In DC Rebirth, I-Ching appears in New Super-Man #7 as a martial arts instructor in China, whose guidance Kong Kenan, the Super-Man of China, seeks in order to better control his powers. I-Ching introduces Kenan to the Bagua, the eight trigrams that represent the fundamental principals of reality, explaining that each of his powers are organized around it. I-Ching accompanies Kenan on his adventures to provide guidance and develops a close father-son relationship with him. In later issues, he is revealed to be connected to an identical-looking villain named All-Yang, who caused multiple conflicts for Kenan and the Justice League of China, using the disguise of Ching Lung, a villain from Detective Comics #1. It is revealed that I-Ching and All-Yang are twin brothers and All-Yang imprisons I-Ching in the realm of ghosts. Despite being trapped in the realm of ghosts, I-Ching is able to send his consciousness to the "realm of abstraction" when Kenan calls upon him for help against All-Yang. I-Ching recounts his and All-Yang's youths during their training at a monastery. Upon discovering that I-Ching and All-Yang were the living embodiments of yin and yang, respectively, their masters instructed each brother to learn a bit of the other's nature to achieve balance. All-Yang refused out of arrogance and abandoned his training, forcing I-Ching to embody both yin and yang. With Kenan's training complete and I-Ching unable to leave the realms of ghosts, I-Ching passes the mantle of yin and yang onto Kenan, who uses his new powers to defeat All-Yang and absorb him into his body. I-Ching's consciousness continues to advise Kenan within the realm of abstraction while All-Yang's consciousness repeatedly attempts to manipulate him. Despite the brothers' warning to not travel between realms, Kenan uses his yin form to travel to the realm of ghosts to rescue his mentor, only to send himself and the entire Justice League of China there instead, where they encounter evil future versions of themselves, including a fully immersed yin and yang version of Kenan called "Perfect-Man". I-Ching appears and rescues his student from Perfect-Man with his own yin and yang abilities. When I-Ching warns Kenan not to rescue him again, Kenan voices his frustration as I-Ching was the only adult figure in his life who never lied to him nor tried to manipulate him. I-Ching tells Kenan to "let go of the goodness that can never be and embrace the goodness that is" and sends him and his friends back to the realm of humans. ==References== ==External links== *Superman - The Sandman Saga *The Diana Prince Era (Fanzing.com) *The Unofficial I Ching Chronology Category:Comics characters introduced in 1968 Category:Fictional blind characters Category:Fictional male martial artists Category:DC Comics martial artists Category:DC Comics male superheroes Category:Wonder Woman characters Category:Characters created by Dennis O'Neil Category:Characters created by Mike Sekowsky Category:Fictional Buddhist monks Category:Chinese superheroes

68412035	I Came from Busan	I Came from Busan (also known as Yeongdo Bridge) (Korean: 영도다리; RR: Yeong-do Da-ri) is a 2009 South Korean film written and directed by Jeon Soo-il. It tells the story of teenaged In-hwa, who gives her newborn baby up for adoption but soon regrets the decision and embarks on a journey to find the child. The Yeongdo Bridge is a key symbol in the film; In-hwa collapses on the bridge before giving birth, and the site remains a prominent part of the backdrop for the story. The Yeongdo Bridge, which connects Yeongdo to Busan, is a place where families and friends separated during the Korean War would wait to reunite; it is also a place that symbolizes the pain of loss. In-hwa is also an orphan who remembers growing up at an orphanage, which plays a part in her decision to find her child. The film focuses on the lives of young and underprivileged people who live amidst a turbulent backdrop. The film was made on a limited budget and shot mostly in Seoul, with the later scenes filmed in Chamonix, a mountainous region in eastern France. == Plot == Eighteen-year-old In-hwa gives birth after collapsing on Yeongdo Bridge. Her best friend, Sang- min, persuades her to give the baby up for adoption, but In-hwa soon regrets the decision. She returns to the adoption center to ask for her baby. In-hwa is repeatedly turned away, but eventually obtains the address of her baby’s adoptive parents, who live overseas. She embarks alone on a trip to France in search of her child. == Cast == * Park Ha-sun as In-hwa * Kim Jung-tae as Sang-mi * Kim Min-jae as Woo-chan * Yoo Soon-chul as old man == Release and reception == The film was selected to participate in the 2009 San Sebastian Film Festival and was released on July 7, 2010.

68426737	I Alone Can Fix It	I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump's Catastrophic Final Year is a nonfiction book written by Washington Post reporters Carol D. Leonnig and Philip Rucker. It was published by Penguin Press in 2021 and was a New York Times bestseller. I Alone Can Fix It is a follow-up to the two authors' 2020 book A Very Stable Genius and covers Donald Trump's last year in office as president of the United States. As David Smith of The Guardian newspaper pointed out, "both titles are direct Trump quotations loaded with irony." The authors interviewed 140 people for their material, including a two-and-a-half-hour interview with Trump himself. The book has generally received positive reviews by book critics. ==Content== The book begins on New Year's Eve 2019, with an email from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control scientist stationed in Beijing to CDC Director Robert Redfield, informing him about cases of unusual pneumonia in the city of Wuhan. It proceeds through the events of 2020—Trump's first impeachment, the spread of COVID-19, the Black Lives Matter protests, the 2020 election and its aftermath—from the perspective of how they impacted Trump and his presidency. Press coverage of the book called particular attention to its depiction of General Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Milley's efforts to prevent what he feared was a potential coup d'etat attempt by Trump. The press also made note of Trump's boast to the authors that if it had not been for the pandemic, even George Washington and Abraham Lincoln could not have beaten him in the election. The book describes Trump "dressing down and humiliating those around him, including former Attorney General William P. Barr." ==Reviews== Smith, reviewing the book for The Guardian, wrote that the authors "have unleashed a second startling story of incompetence and malevolence in the White House." David Green, also in The Guardian, called the book "essential reading", "a blockbuster follow-up to A Very Stable Genius." Dwight Garner, reviewing for The New York Times, said the book "reads like 300 daily newspaper articles taped together" and called it a "grueling" read, "a dense, just-the-facts scrapbook of a dismal year" that included an "almost day-by-day accounting of Trump’s last year in office, from the fumbled Covid response to the second impeachment to Rudy Giuliani's public self-immolations." Garner viewed Michael Wolff's Landslide: The Final Days of the Trump Presidency, released around the same time, as a "more vivid and apt" work. Ron Elving of NPR said that in recounting conversations and thoughts of the participants, Rucker and Leonnig convey "a compelling sense of almost novelistic omniscience, as though the authors had been present and taking notes in a host of conversations they never heard." Mabinty Quarshie, writing in USA Today, said the book makes "a detailed case... that the catastrophe of 2020 was a result of Trump's proclivity to put political optics above all else, including American lives." ==See also== *The New York Times Nonfiction Best Sellers of 2021 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2021 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:Biographies about politicians Category:Books about American politicians Category:Books about the Trump administration Category:English-language books Category:Penguin Press books Category:Criticism of Donald Trump Category:Books about Donald Trump
68448825	I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God	"I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" (stylized in sentence case) is a song by American singer-songwriter Halsey from her fourth studio album If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power, released on August 27, 2021, through Capitol Records. The song impacted US contemporary hit radio on August 31, 2021, as the lead single from the album. It was written by Halsey, Johnathan Cunningham, and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails, and was produced by the latter two, who produced all tracks on the album. ==Background and release== Months after releasing Badlands (Live from Webster Hall) and cancelling the Manic World Tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Halsey began teasing her new era via various billboard across major US cities, alongside teasing the song "Bells in Santa Fe" from the album. It was also revealed that the album was produced by Reznor and Ross, members of American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails. In a short teaser video, Halsey hinted at the album's punk rock sound. On July 7, 2021, Halsey unveiled the cover art and announced that If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power would be released on August 27, 2021. "Bells in Santa Fe" was used in the first trailer for the If I Can't Have Love I Want Power IMAX film (directed by Colin Tilley), under the name "All of This is Temporary". "I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" was first teased under the name "woman/god" in the second trailer for the If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power film on July 29, 2021. The trailer was released just weeks after Halsey gave birth to her first child. The film was screened exclusively for one night, in select IMAX cinema theatres on August 25, 2021, two days before the album's release. In the film, Halsey portrays a young pregnant Queen, Lila, as she "wrestles with the manipulative chokehold of love to ultimately discover that the ability to create life (and end it) unlocks the paranormal power within her". The film featured most of the songs on the album, with "I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" as the eight-song appearing in the film. Two days later, on August 27, the album was released. Halsey released a music video for "I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" alongside the song and album's release which features scenes from the film. On August 31, the song was serviced to US contemporary hit radio as the lead single from If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power. On September 30, 2021, a day after her 27th birthday, Halsey released a remix extended play titled "I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God (Remixes)" with no prior announcement. The EP featured four remixes of "I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" by various producers. == Live performances == On August 29, 2021, Halsey performed a livestream concert of some of the If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power songs including the bonus tracks "Nightmare (Reprise)" and "Gasoline (Reimagined)". "I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" was among these songs and was included on the exclusive live album. To further promote the single, Halsey released the live performance to various video-sharing platforms on September 18, 2021. Halsey performed this song along with "Darling" on Saturday Night Live on October 9, 2021. ==Commercial performance== "I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" was the only track from If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. It debuted and peaked at the number 64 spot. The song also peaked on the Billboard Alternative Streaming Songs, Hot Alternative Songs, Mainstream Top 40, and Global 200 charts at 4, 6, 22, and 73 respectively. The song also charted in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. ==Track listing== *;Digital EP – "I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God (Remixes)" #"I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" (Gazelle Twin Remix) (with Gazelle Twin) – 3:19 #"I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" (On-U Sound Remix)(with Adrian Sherwood) – 4:33 #"I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" (Underworld's Drift Mix) (with Rick Smith) – 3:08 #"I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" (Hot Chip Remix) (with Hot Chip) – 4:54 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Weekly chart performance for "I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" Chart (2021) Peak position Australia (ARIA) 81 Lithuania (AGATA) 87 New Zealand Hot Singles (Recorded Music NZ) 8 ===Year-end charts=== Year-end chart performance for "I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" Chart (2021) Position US Hot Rock & Alternative Songs (Billboard) 49 ==Release history== Release history for "I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God" Region Date Format Label Version United States August 31, 2021 Contemporary hit radio Capitol Original Various September 30, 2021 Remix EP ==Notes== ==References== Category:2021 songs Category:2021 singles Category:American synth-pop songs Category:Halsey (singer) songs Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Songs about pregnancy Category:Songs with feminist themes Category:Songs written by Halsey (singer) Category:Songs written by Trent Reznor Category:Songs written by Atticus Ross Category:Song recordings produced by Trent Reznor Category:Song recordings produced by Atticus Ross
6873724	I Am Alive	I Am Alive is an action-adventure survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world developed by Ubisoft Shanghai and published by Ubisoft. It was released for Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) in March 2012, for PlayStation 3 (via the PlayStation Network) in April, and for Microsoft Windows (via Steam and UPlay) in September. The game takes place one year after "The Event", a cataclysmic disaster that has wiped out most of humanity and reduced cities to rubble. As the game begins, the unnamed protagonist returns to his home in the fictional city of Haventon, hoping to find his wife and daughter, whom he has not seen since the disaster. Finding their apartment empty, he sets out to try to find them, but he soon encounters a young girl named Mei who is looking for her lost mother. Feeling responsible for Mei, the protagonist vows to help find her mother. However, doing so will not be easy as resources are next to impossible to find, the city itself is draped in a toxic dust cloud, and murderous gangs of survivors wander the streets looking for easy prey. Under development by Darkworks from 2005 to 2009, with Ubisoft Shanghai eventually taking over and finishing the game, I Am Alive was announced, postponed, and re-announced multiple times over its seven-year development cycle. Originally a first-person game called Alive, when Ubisoft Shanghai took over the project, they restarted development from scratch, keeping only the original pitch and the focus on gameplay elements other than combat and violence. Inspired by films such as The Road and The Book of Eli, the designers wanted players to experience the emotions and moral quandaries of choosing who lives and who dies. Originally planned as a full retail release, the scope of the game was eventually scaled back to the point where it could be released as a digital- only title. I Am Alive received mixed reviews. Those who liked it tended to laud its tone, atmosphere, combat and intimidation systems, side missions, and the moral component of the gameplay. Many critics also cited the post- apocalyptic world of Haventon as being especially well realised and realistic. Criticisms tended to focus on repetitive combat, restricted AI routines, and clunky climbing mechanics. The game sold well, especially on Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network, topping the charts for each for several weeks after its release, and going on to become one of the top-ten selling games of 2012 on both networks. ==Gameplay== I Am Alive is an action-adventure survival game, in which the player controls the unnamed protagonist from a third-person perspective, although the camera switches to first-person when aiming and shooting. The game's most frequently employed mechanic is climbing, which is governed by a stamina meter, whereby physically demanding activities, such as jumping or running exert stamina and drain the meter. Once the protagonist's feet are off the ground, everything exerts stamina, even hanging motionlessly. Some actions exert more stamina than others - for example, jumping from one beam to another when climbing uses a lot more stamina than shimmying across a beam. The stamina meter refills automatically when the player is on solid ground, unless the protagonist is outside at ground level, where the dust in the air constantly depletes the stamina meter, and eventually the health meter. If the player runs out of stamina when climbing, they are allowed a few seconds for a final exertion to try to get to solid ground. However, such exertion results in a piece of the stamina meter itself disappearing (thus reducing the maximum stamina the player can have). This loss can only be restored by using a specific item. To aid in climbing, the player can use pitons, which allow the protagonist to rest and recharge his stamina mid- climb. Each piton can only be used in a single location; once they are placed into a wall, they cannot be removed. left|thumb|Screenshot from I Am Alive showing the protagonist attempting to lure an armed enemy in for a quick kill. By raising his hands, he can fool enemies into thinking he has surrendered, and when they get close, he can cut their throat with his machete. Hostile encounters are another major part of the gameplay. When the protagonist is confronted by a group of hostiles, there are various strategies available, depending on how the group acts. He can surprise a single enemy with a machete quick kill, engage in melee combat with a single enemy at a time, draw his gun and attempt to intimidate the enemies into surrendering (irrespective of whether or not he has ammo), or actually fire his gun (or bow), killing one enemy in the hopes the others will surrender. When an enemy has surrendered, the player has the option of either knocking them out, or pushing them off a ledge or into a fire (if available at the location). The player must always keep a lookout for the group's leader (usually the most talkative member of the group), and attempt to kill him first, as this will often compel the others to surrender. On the other hand, killing a weaker group member will cause a group leader to immediately attack. If the protagonist aims his gun at enemies for too long without doing anything, they will become convinced he is bluffing and attack. Another component of the game involves collecting resources and supplies scattered throughout the city, including items such as water, food, gas, medicine, and ammo. These items can be used to replenish the player's health and stamina, and often restore the maximum size of the stamina bar. Resources such as cigarettes and alcohol have a negative effect on the player's stats, and are instead intended for use in side missions. As the player encounters non-hostile survivors, they will make requests for various items. When the player gives them the required item, the player will receive a single retry, and the survivor will fill some of the game's backstory. The game saves automatically at checkpoints, but if the player dies during combat or climbing, they can use a retry, which allows them to return to the specific area where they died without having to go all the way back to the previous checkpoint. Retries are scarce, however, and can only be obtained by finding them in the game world or by completing sidequests. If the player dies without any retires in their inventory, they are forced to return to the previous checkpoint, which is oftentimes right at the start of a level. ==Plot== The game takes place a year after a catastrophic disaster known as "The Event" wiped out 90% of the human race. The cataclysm continues to make itself felt by way of aftershocks and the toxic dust that hangs permanently within the half-collapsed cities. In the weeks and months after The Event, resource shortages quickly became peoples' biggest problem, a situation that has only gotten worse as time has passed. As the game begins, society has broken down into small pockets of survivors, some of whom want only to protect what meagre resources they have, whereas others are out to get everything they can. No matter their agenda, however, everyone is on guard and on edge, and everyone is capable of violence. The game opens with an unnamed man arriving in his home city of Haventon, hoping to find his wife, Julie, and daughter, Mary, whom he last saw just before The Event. Recording updates via a video camera, which are being watched by an unidentified person at some point in the future, he explains it took him almost a year to walk back to Haventon from "out east". When he gets to his apartment, he finds a note written by Julie in which she explains that she and Mary left shortly after The Event, hoping to make it to one of the emergency camps. She also tells him that she forgives him for everything. As he is leaving the apartment, he sees a small girl who he initially mistakes for Mary, before saving her from three hostile men. The girl, Mei, tells him that her mother went missing on a supply run and she gives him a walkie-talkie with which to speak to Henry, Mei's family friend. Upon arriving at Henry's apartment, Henry thanks the protagonist for protecting Mei, and asks him to retrieve a radio transmitter. Henry himself is unable to get it as he is confined to a wheelchair. Traversing the deadly dust clouds, the protagonist is able to retrieve the transmitter. Back in the apartment Henry tells him that Mei's mother is in a local hotel, held against her will, and asks him to save her. Fighting his way through gang members who take women prisoner and force them to provide sexual gratification, he finds and rescues Mei's mother, Linda. On the way back to Henry's, she says that Henry used to oversee the dispatch and communications systems of the Haventon Fire Department, and will probably know the locations of all the emergency camps in the city. At Henry's, Linda and Mei are reunited, and Linda is able to use the radio to pick up a broadcast from a ship en route to Haventon to collect survivors. However, it can't dock because of the heavy dust. Henry says they need to create a beacon to guide the boat in by using fireworks. The protagonist takes the fireworks to the roof of the tallest building in the city, where he successfully ignites them. However, upon returning to the apartment, he finds Henry, Linda, and Mei gone. Outside, he encounters Linda, who tells him that men came and took Mei. Henry pursued them, but he didn't return. The protagonist finds Henry's wheelchair and learns from an injured man that Henry was taken by the gang, who wanted to learn what he knew about the camps. Eventually, the protagonist finds Mei, and the beacon successfully guides the ship into the harbour. Mei and Linda get aboard but the protagonist decides to stay, still hoping to find Julie and Mary, and maybe Henry. Mei and Linda bid him farewell and he records his last tape, vowing that he will find his family no matter what and apologizing to Julie, promising her that he will find a way to "make it up". It is then revealed that the person watching the tapes is a young woman. As the protagonist vows to find Julie and Mary, the woman begins to cry, and we see that all of the protagonist's gear is on a nearby table. ==Development== ===Darkworks (2005-2009)=== thumb|Yves Guillemot The game was first mentioned on September 3, 2006, in an article on how to get more women involved with playing video games in the International Herald Tribune. In the article, Ubisoft's Chief Executive, Yves Guillemot, stated, "next year, Ubisoft will publish a game called Alive that features characters who rely on their instincts and each other to endure after an earthquake." Nothing more was heard about the game until July 2008, when Gamekyo reported that Assassin's Creed producer and co-creator Jade Raymond was producing what was now called I Am Alive. According to the article, the game was a first- person "survival-adventure" set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago. Developed by Darkworks for PlayStation 3, Microsoft Windows, and Xbox 360, it had originally gone into production in 2005, and was now scheduled for a second quarter 2009 release. When asked about Raymond's involvement, Ubisoft declined to comment. At E3 the following week, Ubisoft formally unveiled a CGI trailer showcasing the game's post-apocalyptic setting and introducing the protagonist, Adam Collins. Guillemot stated that the game "will appeal to anyone that enjoys a thrilling journey. It will offer a rich palette of emotions while challenging players to make life-changing decisions." In August, Ubisoft executive director, Alain Corre told MCV that there were hopes the game could launch a new franchise; "we hope it can be another strong franchise for our portfolio, alongside Prince of Persia or Rayman Rabbids. It's a new baby for us – and we have big hopes." In January 2009, Ubisoft confirmed that Raymond was not working on the title in any capacity, with Alexis Goddard serving as senior producer. She explained that the game would feature violence only as a last resort, and "we wanted the player to really feel the power of Mother Nature, to feel the danger coming from the collapsing towers and devastating rifts, feel the chaos happening all around him. There's nothing like a first-person view to create that kind of emotion." The game was now slated for release in March of that year. However, the following day, Ubisoft published a release schedule for the remainder of the fiscal year that did not include I Am Alive. They attributed its absence to the fact that it "will require further development time and will now bolster the line-up for 2009-10." In March, Ubisoft announced that Darkworks were no longer working on the game, due to the changes in the release schedule; "in order to respect the new launch date for this ambitious title, and Darkworks having other obligations, we have mutually decided to complete development of I Am Alive at Ubisoft Shanghai, as the two studios have collaborated on aspects of the title over the past year. The team at Darkworks has respected its contractual obligations on the project and will be a part of the success of the game when it launches." ===Ubisoft Shanghai (2009-2012)=== In May 2009, Ubisoft confirmed that the game was scheduled for a January-March 2010 release. However, in July, in their 2009-2010 Q1 fiscal year report, they announced that it had been pushed back to the fiscal year 2010-2011, meaning an April 2010 release at the earliest. Little more was heard about the game until January 2010, when it was pushed back even further - to the fiscal year 2011-2012, meaning an April 2011 release at the earliest. In a conference call, Guillemot stated, "we have been totally re-engineering the product, so it is still on the way." In May 2011, after Ubisoft announced it had cancelled a number of planned titles as part of an internal restructuring exercise, Eurogamer reached out to the company and were assured that both I Am Alive and Beyond Good and Evil 2 were still very much in development, although they also stated, "we have nothing new to report on those two titles for the moment." In June, PlayStationLifeStyle noted that the game had been listed by the Australian Classification Board, rated 15+ for "strong violence". It was then rated by the ESRB in September, suggesting a release was imminent. Rated as "Mature", according to the ESRB's report, the game "is an action game in which players assume the role of a man who must find his family in a post- apocalyptic world. From a third-person perspective, players traverse through city ruins and use a machete to kill human enemies in melee-style combat." This was the first reference to the game being third-person; up to this point, it was still thought to be first-person. A few days later, Ubisoft released a new trailer, which looked radically different from that shown at E3 2008. In this new iteration of the game, the story is set in the fictional city of Haventon rather than Chicago, and the main character is no longer named Adam Collins, instead, he is unnamed. Ubisoft also revealed that the game would be digital-only, and was scheduled for release on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade "this winter"; "Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network are the perfect platforms to leverage the mature and challenging experiences of the game." They also stated that the previously announced PC version had been cancelled, although they offered no information as to why. In November, Ubisoft began releasing gameplay clips and giving interviews to game journalists. Speaking to Eurogamer, Ubisoft Shanghai's director of business and marketing, Aurélien Palasse, said that when Ubisoft took over the project from Darkworks, they essentially started development from scratch; "it arrived in Shanghai in 2010, and we decided to make it more realistic. We started from scratch, but with the same pitch." Speaking to Digital Spy, creative director Stanislas Mettra echoed these comments; Speaking of the reaction to the first iteration of the game, he explained, "the top management decided to not release it, they even considered to cancel the whole thing, but we proposed the idea of going XBLA, propose really something really new and different, redo the levels as they have to be, and present this ." Meanwhile, speaking to IncGamers about the decision to abandon the PC version of the game, Mettra explained that the main reason for doing so was the financial cost of piracy; "there's so much piracy and so few people are paying for PC games that we have to precisely weigh it up against the cost of making it. Perhaps it will only take 12 guys three months to port the game to PC, it's not a massive cost but it's still a cost. If only 50,000 people buy the game then it's not worth it." However, some of his comments received considerable backlash, especially, "we've heard loud and clear that PC gamers are bitching about there being no version for them. But are these people just making noise just because there's no version or because it's a game they actually want to play?" The following day, he sent IncGamers a follow up email, in which he said he had misspoken; "I don't think I meant to say "the game won't happen on pc [...] What I meant is that the pc version did not happen yet. But we are still working to see the feasibility of it, which is not necessarily simple. I gave some examples to illustrate the problematic , but obviously it is not in my hands and not my part to talk about this." In January 2012, Ubisoft confirmed that the Xbox Live version would join Alan Wake's American Nightmare, Nexuiz, and Warp as part of the "Xbox Live Arcade House Party" event, which would run from February 15 to March 7, with a game released each week. The day before the game went live on XBLA, an iOS companion app was released on the App Store, featuring maps of the game's locations, hints and tips, an Achievement checklist, information on the effects of each type of resource, concept art, the game's soundtrack, trailers, a short making-of documentary, and a photo filter. Two weeks after the release of the Xbox version, Ubisoft announced the PlayStation version would be made available in April. In August, it was announced that the once-cancelled PC version would release on Steam and UPlay in September. This version would feature improved graphics with higher resolutions and two new modes of play - an "Easy" difficulty offering infinite retries and a "Replay" mode allowing players to replay any completed levels at any time. ===Genre=== Conceptually, from its very inception, the game was geared towards avoiding violence when possible. When speaking to the International Herald Tribune in 2006, Guillemot stated, "it reflects the company's focus on an "action plus" style. It's more oriented toward drama, more life in characters, more depth. It's still about surviving, but you can't resolve things by shooting only." At E3 in 2008, he said that "players will be challenged to think, react and take risks that will directly affect themselves and those around them." When the game was re-announced in September 2011, an Ubisoft press release stated, "I Am Alive presents a unique take on the post- apocalyptic, survival genre by creating more complex and emotional situations for the player." Speaking to GameSpot in January 2012, Aurélien Palasse said, "I Am Alive is the opposite of gaming's postapocalyptic power fantasy. Post- disaster [in games] is often unrealistic, and I Am Alive is realistic. I think it's different from all the other games we've seen: it's more mature; everything is real." He cited films such as The Road and The Book of Eli as specific inspirations. Speaking to VentureBeat at CES in January 2012, Mettra said of the game, "we wanted to focus the experience on something human- centric, and that's why there's no zombies, no monsters. It's really about the human condition." He emphasised that the game is not about shooting hundreds of enemies or engaging in mindless combat; "when you're surrounded by a group of bad guys, it's always important to assess the situation and see who's the most dangerous - if someone is carrying a weapon, some might have a gun, some might have a machete, you need to take down the one with the gun first." Speaking of the importance of the stamina bar, Palasse reiterated, "you're not a superhero." In a "making of" video released in January 2012, Mettra further explains, "the premise of this game calls for something different and it forced us to rethink a lot of the traditional mechanics that we have in survival games." ==Reception== The PlayStation 3 version of I Am Alive received "generally favorable reviews", holding an aggregate score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on fifteen reviews. The PC and Xbox 360 versions received "mixed or average" reviews, with scores of 66 out of 100 from ten reviews, and 69 out of 100 from sixty-eight reviews. Writing for Australia's PlayStation Official Magazine, Clint McCreadie scored the PlayStation 3 version 9 out of 10, praising the core game mechanics and the psychological discomfit one feels when playing. He wrote, "rare is the game that packs in this much originality, pulse-racing action, and palpable pride at overcoming serious challenges," and he concluded by calling it "an original and satisfying challenge. A breath of fresh air." Destructoids Maurice Tan scored the Xbox 360 version 8.5 out of 10, praising the climbing, combat, tone, and management of morality. His one major criticism was that combat never gives the player a non-violent solution, arguing that "the lack of a penalty for killing [enemies] eliminates any moral compass the game carefully tries to construct." Nevertheless, he concluded, "I Am Alive is a remarkable accomplishment. Not only does it create an atmospheric world that feels real enough to identify with, but it succeeds at delivering a unique experience geared towards an adult audience while simultaneously being a fun game to play." Game Informers Tim Turi scored the Xbox 360 version 8.5 out of 10, praising the combat, climbing, side missions, and tone, and calling it "one of the most memorable survival games I've ever played." Eurogamers Tom Bramwell scored it 8 out of 10, praising the tone, gameplay, and the moral element of the side-missions. His main criticism was that the combat and intimidation systems never develop or become any more complicated or in-depth than how they are first introduced. GameSpots Tom McShea scored the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions 8 out of 10, writing, "I Am Alive is so effective because it removes many artificial barriers and forces you to make intimate and emotional decisions." He particularly praised the psychological component of the combat system, the atmosphere, tone, and how it draws the player in emotionally, calling it "an engrossing experience that's difficult to forget." PC Gamers Julian Benson scored the PC version 73%, feeling that combat was repetitive; "you must repeat the same encounter many times, always following the same routine: surprise kill, shoot, ledge kick." However, he praised how well realised Haventon felt and the general tone and atmosphere. He concluded, "it falls just short of being satisfying." Writing for the US's Official Xbox Magazine, Corey Cohen scored the Xbox 360 version 7.5 out of 10, calling it "an absorbing action/adventure, if one that doesn't quite match its creators' ambitions." He lauded how the art style and graphics mirrored the game's dark theme and tone, but he criticised the save and retry system, finding it "overly convoluted." Writing for the UK's edition, Edwin Evans-Thirlwell scored the game 7 out of 10, calling it "occasionally brilliant." He found the intimidation system to be "a clunky and repetitive business" and called the stamina meter "irritating". Nevertheless, he acknowledged that at times, the game was exceptionally well put together. Writing for the UK's PlayStation Official Magazine, Joel Gregory scored the PlayStation 3 version 7 out of 10. He found combat to be repetitive, but he also argued that "this is a survival game that gets way more right than wrong." He was particularly impressed with how well crafted the game world was. He concluded, "that a game with such a troubled development has turned out so well is impressive." IGNs Greg Miller scored the Xbox 360 version 4.5 out of 10, criticising the graphics and gameplay and calling the game "a cumbersome, frustrating mess." He argued that it fails to create any emotional stakes because "there's no impact to the deaths," and he concluded by calling it "a flat, frustrating game that isn't worth your time or money." Two weeks later, after his review generated negative feedback, Miller had other members of staff write short reviews. Keza MacDonald called it "thematically brilliant but mechanically unsatisfying". Eric Neigher criticised the "clunky combat, brutal, learn-by-dying scenes, and a general lack of polish." Steven Hopper found it to be "an incomplete experience that doesn't quite work." Peter Eykemans called it "a good idea and a bad game," finding it buggy and poorly paced. Destin Legarie stated, "I would highly recommend that you pass on the entire experience." ===Sales=== The game sold very well. For the first three weeks of its release, it was the top selling game on Xbox Live Arcade. It was ultimately the eighth best- selling 2012 title on XBLA. On the PlayStation Network, it was the top selling title for April 2012. In both May and June, it was the fourth top-selling title. It remained in the top-ten until April 2013. ==References== Category:2012 video games Category:Darkworks games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Survival video games Category:Ubisoft games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in China Category:Video games set in 2007 Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Video games using Havok Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Windows games

68857078	I Could Be the One (Donna Lewis song)	"I Could Be the One" is a song by Welsh singer-songwriter Donna Lewis from her second studio album, Blue Planet (1998). Lewis wrote the lyrics and produced the track alone while composing the music with Scottish musician Gary Clark. Lewis intended the song and album to remove the one-hit wonder tag that she had obtained with her 1996 worldwide hit, "I Love You Always Forever". Lewis's record label, Atlantic Records, released the song in the United States on 23 June 1998 and in the United Kingdom on 6 July 1998. Several music writers predicted that the song would become a major hit, but it failed to make an impact, stalling at number 99 in the UK and failing to chart in the US. The song found better success in Austria, where it reached number nine, and it also charted in Australia and Germany. ==Background== Prior to the song's release, Donna Lewis was a one-hit wonder with her 1996 song "I Love You Always Forever". Speaking to Billboard magazine, Lewis explained that although she was happy with the success of the aforementioned song and its parent album, Now in a Minute, she wanted to show the public that she was capable of writing more hit songs. For her follow-up album, Blue Planet, Lewis decided to replace drum loops with real drums, which "I Could Be the One" utilises courtesy of future Waterboys drummer Ralph Salmins. Lewis wrote the lyrics to the song and produced it herself, and she co-wrote the music with Gary Clark. Additional musicians on the track include Gerry Leonard on guitar, Tony Franklin on bass, and David Lowe handling drum programming. Lewis recorded the song at Windgate in Howth, Ireland, while the drums were recorded at Windmill Lane Studios in nearby Dublin. ==Release== "I Could Be the One" was included as the second track on Blue Planet and was issued as the debut single from the album, which was released in the United States on 14 July 1998. Atlantic Records serviced the song to American pop and adult contemporary radio on 29 May 1998, with a physical release following on 23 June of the same year. Although the song was widely expected to become a big hit, it failed to appear on the US Billboard charts. It performed similarly in the United Kingdom, where it stalled at number 99 on the UK Singles Chart in July 1998. In mainland Europe, the single charted in Germany and Austria. Although it reached number 69 in Germany, "I Could Be the One" was a top-10 success in Austria, where it peaked at number nine in October 1998 and spent 12 weeks in the top 40. In Australia, the song reached number 76 on the ARIA Singles Chart. ==Critical reception== Reviewing the song on its 20 June 1998 issue, Billboard called "I Could Be the One" a "pleasant li'l pop chugger" and wrote that Lewis's breathy vocals complements the music well, noting its more complex rhythm than typical songs.

68887176	I Am, I Feel	"I Am, I Feel" is the debut single by British pop music duo Alisha's Attic, released in July 1996 by Mercury from the duo's debut album, Alisha Rules the World (1996). The song was written by sisters Karen and Shelly Poole, and produced by Dave Stewart. It quickly became a radio and chart hit in the UK, peaking at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart. Lyrically, the duo has stated that it is about "a woman rebelling against a man" in a relationship gone bad. "I Am, I Feel" was nominated in the category for Best Song Musically & Lyrically at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards. ==Chart performance== In the duo's native UK, "I Am, I Feel" debuted at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart on 28 July 1996.

American magazine Billboard described it as a "engaging pop song", noting "the witty, assertive lyrics [that] show a confident act driven by intelligent songwriting capped with exciting vocals". Daina Darzin from Cash Box stated that it "is well on its way to being a hit." She felt that the song "is a great example of the more lighthearted end of this British female duo's quirky, funky sound (kinda like a cross between Kate Bush and Prince) which adds a bit of ska beat to a pretty melody and sarcastic lyrics like "I wanna bite his head off/Yeah that'd be fun"." Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian said in her album review, "Their iron-fist-in-velvet-glove persona is mildly fetching on the kittenish singles 'I Am, I Said' and 'Alisha Rules the World'.Sullivan, Caroline (15 November 1996). "Music: This week's pop CD releases". The Guardian. A reviewer from Music Week rated it five out of five and named it Single of the Week, adding, "This brilliant pop song marks the debut of the Dagenham duo of sisters and should launch them as one of the nation's finest pop hopes.

The Times. 22 February 1997. Issue 65820. In 2012, the song was picked as an Official Chart 'Pop Gem'.

69088467	I Am the Beggar of the World	thumb|First edition I Am the Beggar of the World: Landays from Contemporary Afghanistan is a 2014 collection of over 100 landays written by female Afghans, and translated into English by Eliza Griswold. The book also includes images taken by Seamus Murphy. The collection was generally well received, winning the 2014 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation. Critics praised the window the poems offered into the lives of women in Afghanistan as well as Murphy's photographs and other contextual materials included by Griswold. == Background and compilation == The landay is a style of poetry from Afghanistan. They are generally twenty-two syllables long, with nine in their first line, and thirteen in the second and final. The American poet Eliza Griswold traveled around Afghanistan with Seamus Murphy, a photographer, to collect landays from remote places around the nation. They often traveled in secret. Griswold wrote in an article published by the BBC that her project was what she called "investigative poetry." She had learned of the poetry form after hearing of a young girl that allegedly killed herself after being forbidden to write poetry. In total, Griswold collected over 100 such poems written by female Afghan poets to create I Am the Beggar of the World. She translated the poems from Pashto into English. Most of her English translations are modified so that the two lines rhyme, which is uncommon. The book also includes about 50 images taken by Murphy. I Am the Beggar of the World was published in 2014 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The landays included within are grouped by their theme. Griswold includes context of where the poems came from or what they were about. The titular landay, for instance, came from a woman living near Jalalabad in a refugee camp whose husband was dying: == Reception == The book won the 2014 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation. Tess Taylor described the book's poetry in NPR as feeling "both anonymous and universal" and commented on the window it offered to the lives of women living in Afghanistan. The book was described as a "rich and graceful collection" by Elizabeth T. Gray Jr. in the Harvard Review. She praised Griswold's decision to make her translations rhyme. John Bradley wrote for Rain Taxi that it "offers much to entrance and disturb". He felt the context of the poems made them more powerful and that the landays offered "remarkable" stories of women in a culture where their voices were often silenced. A review published in Ohio State University's The Journal said that the book "adds a new chapter to the ancient story of human indomitability". A reviewer for The Christian Science Monitor also praised both the writing and photography. Gray praised Murphy's photography, describing them as "stunning" and noting how they complemented the poems included. == References == Category:2014 poetry books Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books
69185774	I Believe (Tim Burgess album)	I Believe is the debut solo album by British rock musician Tim Burgess of the Charlatans, released on 8 September 2003 through the labels PIAS Recordings and Straight Trippin. Following promotion of the Charlatans' seventh studio album Wonderland (2001), Burgess started working with Linus of Hollywood. They recorded at the latter's place in Los Angeles, dubbed Franklin Castle, in late 2002. Burgess had co-written the majority of the songs with Linus. I Believe is a pop soul album that takes inspiration from the work of the Beach Boys, Curtis Mayfield and Joe Strummer. I Believe received generally favourable reviews from music critics, many of whom praised the songwriting. It charted at number 28 in Scotland and number 38 in the United Kingdom, while "I Believe in the Spirit" reached number 44 and 54 in the UK, respectively. Before the album's release, Burgess went on a UK tour and performed at V Festival. At the end of this, "I Believe in the Spirit" was released as the album's lead single; "Only a Boy" followed in November 2003, which was promoted with another UK tour. I Believe was released in the United States through Koch Records; this was delayed due to the Charlatans promoting their eighth studio album Up at the Lake (2004). ==Background and recording== The Charlatans released their seventh studio album Wonderland in September 2001 through Universal Records. Promotion started with a tour of the United Kingdom in October 2001, and ended with a supporting slot for Stereophonics and three headlining club shows in August 2002. Frontman Tim Burgess wanted to continue writing, but the rest of the band members wanted a break. Around this time, he taught himself how to play guitar, though felt embarrassed to play it with others present. He expressed a desire to experiment with brass and string insturmentation. In October 2002, Dotmusic reported that Burgess was recording on his solo debut studio album, linking up with Linus of Hollywood. The pair shared a management team; Linus was known for his work wuth Lil' Kim, Puff Daddy and the Smashing Pumpkins. Burgess met Linus at The Cat & Fiddle pub, located on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Days after this, the band denied potential rumours of them breaking up, explaining that the members are working on other projects, such as Burgess on his album. I Believe was recorded at the Franklin Castle, which was the name for Linus' apartment between Franklin Avenue and La Brea Avenue. As Burgess lived on the hills not far from Franklin, he would work there each day. The project evolved from an acoustic EP of simply Burgess and a guitar, until strings were added. He then had the urge to include a brass a section; a trumpeter was brought in initially to play on one song, but it eventually featured on four of them. After basic tracks were done, they showed the songs to other musicians they wished to have contribute to the recordings. When others heard it, they said he should include a single-sounding track, prompting him to compose "Only a Boy", "Oh My Corazon" and "Say Yes". In November 2002, Burgess took a break to go on a DJ tour of the UK; as recording continued, Burgess had planned to have it completed by the Christmas period. Linus served as the producer while Michael Patterson did additional production and mixed the album at Patty's House with assistance from Gary Dean. ==Composition and lyrics== Musically, the sound of I Believe has been described as pop soul, taking influences from the work of the Beach Boys, Curtis Mayfield and Joe Strummer. Burgess said Los Angeles, where he was living, served as inspiration for the album as it had for Wonderland and its predecessor Us and Us Only (1999) previously. He wrote the majority of the tracks on the ground floor of his house in the city; most of them were co-written with Linus. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it was "recognizably the work of the Charlatans' leader -- there is a similar fondness for laid-back, easy-rolling classic rock, sunny hooks, a vague infatuation with lite dance rhythms". When asked about the album title, Burgess said he "believe[s] in myself. I believe I've done a good job". For Mark Vischer's saxophone parts, Burgess asked him to watch Lost Highway (1997), which he said had a "pretty intense solo sax scene". The opening track, "I Believe in the Spirit", has a 1970s West Coast atmosphere, with Burgess reprising his falsetto from the Wonderland track "Love Is the Key". It is a love song to Los Angeles, where he relocated to a few years prior. Discussing the song, Burgess said he "fell in love with the demeanour of almost everyone who works, serves and makes the place [Los Angeles] tick".Burgess 2019, p. 125 Burgess described "Held in Straps" as "quite an angry song about starting something and leaving a trail behind". "Only a Boy" sees Burgess have nostalgia for being innocent in his youth and finding love, accompanied by what Jack Smith of BBC Music described as a "jangly pop backdrop, which is almost Caribbean in flavour". musicOMH writer David Welsh considered it to Badly Drawn Boy, circa The Hour of Bewilderbeast (2000), because of the "jangly guitar layered over some lively brass sections". Burgess said it was influenced by seeing homeless kids around Los Angeles. With "We All Need Love", Burgess wanted to write something with a wide appeal, akin to boy band lyricsBurgess 2019, p. 131 Burgess wrote the lyrics to "Oh My Corazon" outside The Cat & Fiddle; he said he first heard the Spanish word Corazon in "Spanish Bombs" (1979) by the Clash.Burgess 2019, p. 129 "Be My Baby" is driven by cello and harmonica instrumentation, and features Burgess singing in falsetto again, in the vein of the Beach Boys and Kate Bush. He made a demo of it at a studio next door to The Cat & Fiddle while his friend Randy Billings was in attendance, who would receive co-writing credit. "Years Ago" is a country rock song that emulates the style of Bob Dylan. It was written at when Charlatans guitarist Mark Collins came to visit Burgess in Los Angeles, the pair had not seen one another for some time. "Say Yes" is a string-enhanced soul song that RTÉ.ie writer Anne-Louise Foley called "part disco and part Motown, it's 'Going Loco in Acapulco' with a mirror ball". The tack piano and horn section in "Love to Spend the Night" earned it a comparison to the work of the Band and Van Dyke Parks. It was the first track written for the album, and the sole one credited to only Burgess. The initial demo of it lasted over eight minutes and was done with an engineer in a studio on Sunset Sunset Boulevard. "Po' Boy Soul" deals with being driven; it deals with the consequences of him living in Los Angeles as the Charlatans were based in the United Kingdom. Burgess felt that the closing track, "All I Ever Do", recalled the work of Josh Schwartz, while the ending evoked the sound of Crazy Horse. ==Release== In August 2003, Burgess embarked on a short tour of the UK, leading up to a performance at V Festival; his backing band was dubbed the Califrnian Angels. "I Believe in the Spirit" was released as the lead single from his forthcoming album on 25 August 2003. I Believe was released on 8 September 2003 through the labels PIAS Recordings and Straight Trippin. The Japanese edition included a cover of Bob Marley's "Who the Cap Fit" (1976) and a radio session version of "Years Ago" as bonus tracks, alongside the music video for "Only a Boy". "Only a Boy" was released as a single on 3 November 2003. That same month, Burgess went on another tour of the UK. The US edition, released by Koch Records on 26 April 2005, featured "Who the Cap Fit", "Rough Time" and "I Believe in the West Coast" as bonus tracks. By the time it came out, the Charlatans had released their next album, Up at the Lake (2004), a year prior; two songs on it, namely "Cry Yourself to Sleep" and "I'll Sing a Hymn (You Came to Me)", continued the sound of I Believe. Burgess explained that he was unable to find a label for the US market when it was originally released, and while Koch had shown interest, he was busy with making Up at the Lake. When touring in support of that album ceased, Burgess focused on the US release of I Believe. He celebrated it with a one-off show in Los Angeles with members of Starsailor, who were recording in the city, as his backing band. ==Reception== Erlewine felt that after the last few Charlatans releases, I Believe was a "nice relief, and the entire record has an appealing, relaxed vibe that makes it a good soundtrack for a sunny afternoon". Though he mentioned that none of the individual tracks were particular memorable, "but as a whole, it's a nice, friendly record that proves that it was a good idea for Burgess to go it alone this time around". Foley was equally impressed with the album, despite not liking Burgess' work with the Charlatans; Neil McKay of the Belfast Telegraph said that it shared nothing with the Charlatans, "which is a good start". Exclaim! Michael Edwards, meanwhile, said the "best songs are those that don't sound too different from the Charlatans, probably because that is when he sounds most comfortable". Drowned in Sound writer Gareth Dobson worried that it would be a "hackneyed old Dylan/country affair", and was relieved that it was "actually a very good collection of white boy pop soul". He considered the album's best moments to be when it "goes all out with massive arrangements and joyful tunes", singling out "Only a Boy" and "We All Need Love". Aidin Vaziri of SFGATE was surprised that Burgess created a record that successfully honoured all of his influences "without simply falling breathlessly at their Cuban boot heels". The staff at BBC Manchester wrote that it was a "decent album. There are moments when Burgess maybe should have reined himself in a little, but they are few and far between". Welsh said Burgess comes across as a "man indulging himself, eventually free of his band" and the lyrics were "competent, but nothing more really" The Guardian David Peschek highlighted a lyric from "I Believe in the Spirit" and followed it by saying that if that "doesn't make you wince, then the uncomfortable falsetto of Be My Baby, the lame white 1980s funk of Say Yes and the shocking banality of the chorus to Oh My Corazon probably will". Peter Mattinson of No Ripcord said that the opening song was "unfortunately the best thing to be found here by some way" as the "songwriting talent that kept the Charlatans afloat during their darker days has seemingly deserted Burgess". I Believe charted at number 28 in Scotland and number 38 in the UK. In 2007, he estimated that it sold around 50,000 copies in the UK. "I Believe in the Spirit" reached number 44 in the UK, while "Only a Boy" peaked at number 54. ==Track listing== Writing credits per booklet. ==Personnel== Personnel per booklet.

69549512	I Am Gen Z	I Am Gen Z is a 2021 documentary film about the impact of the digital revolution on our society, our brains and mental health, and how the forces driving it are working against humanity. This has huge ramifications for the first generation growing up with mobile digital technology - Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012. Produced by Chantelle De Carvalho and directed and edited by Liz Smith, the film's music was composed by film composer Kim Halliday. I Am Gen Z premiered at the 2021 Copenhagen International Documentary Film Festival (CPH:DOX). The film is available in two versions, 100 minutes and a shortened 52 minutes. The issues raised in the film are not only of interest to the Generation Z community, but also to parents, carers and educators, and the film attempts to promote a greater understanding of the effects of the technology on the mental health and development of young people. Part of that endeavour is an innovative programme of educational outreach that runs alongside broadcast and VOD releases. == Background == The documentary juxtaposes expert testimony against commentary and content from Generation Z contributors, the first generation to grow up with mobile digital technology. Contributing psychologists, scientists, writers and digital technologists include Dr. Tracy A. Dennis-Tiwary, Tim Kendall, Natasha Devon MBE, Paul Barrett, Dr Jack Lewis, Jamie Bartlett, Clive Thompson, Dr Paul Marsden, Johnny Tooze, Marc Atherton, Dr Leslie Carr, Professor Sir Simon Wessely, Dr David Halpern and Kathy Sheehan. The film explores a wide variety of issues facing the Generation Z community including the effect of smartphones, body image & self harm, mental health, dating and relationships, the power of Algorithms and AI, misinformation, and conspiracy theories. The nature and science of each issue is explained by experts, along with discussions and content from Generation Z who have been affected or influenced by them. == Synopsis == An investigation through expert interviews and the web lens of Generation Z, the documentary explores the impact of the digital revolution on our society, our brains and our mental health, how the forces driving it are working against humanity and have put us on a dangerous trajectory that has huge consequences for the first generation growing up with "always on" mobile digital technology. Unfiltered viewpoints from a cast of Generation Z characters are expressed through their screen worlds, interplaying with expert analysis from psychologists, scientists, writers and digital technologists from the Generation X and Boomer years, as we explore how the explosion of the digital revolution is impacting our society, our brains and mental health. This exploration of Generation Z shows the new normal for many young people today, whether in a small town in Arizona, London or the hubbub of New York. With self-deprecating humour, they talk to us in their language, through TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. The children of Generation Z are becoming adults in a world mediated by digital technologies with little or no transparency, a planet facing climate change and an unprecedented global pandemic. We see the unfiltered reality of the mental health issues that Generation Z face, we are challenged to question: were we not blind to how smartphones would affect the lives of those being born around that time? Digital technology promised so much, but are the forces driving it too powerful for us to prevent a negative effect on the futures of Generation Z? Generation Z tell us how they see their future and how they refuse to be the ones to allow the negative effects to win. == Cast == * Preston Seraph - Generation Z activist (USA) * Dr. Tracy A.

6955261	I Ain't Mad at Cha	"I Ain't Mad at Cha" is a song by American rapper 2Pac from Shakur's fourth studio album, All Eyez on Me (1996). It was released on September 15, 1996 two days after Shakur's death as the album's fourth and final single. The song features contemporary soul singer Danny Boy providing vocals for its hook and was written by Shakur, Danny Boy and Daz Dillinger, who produced the song using a sample from DeBarge's "A Dream". The lyrics focus on Shakur reminiscing about past friends, love interests and associates he has lost touch with. The song is widely considered one of Shakur's best with Cheo Hodari Coker calling it "possibly the best song 2Pac has ever recorded". In 1998, The Source ranked the song's three verses second in its category of "dopest verses" in the history of hip-hop. The single release differs from the version on the album with re-recorded vocals, alternative lyrics and a live band playing the beat. "I Ain't Mad at Cha" charted well internationally reaching number 13 on the UK Singles chart and number 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay. It also charted in the Top 30 on New Zealand, Netherlands, Ireland and Germany. It was not released as a single in the United States making it ineligible to chart on the Billboard singles charts. A small portion of the instrumental was used in the Super Bowl LVI halftime show on February 13, 2022. ==Background== The track was produced by Daz Dillinger and samples the song "A Dream" by DeBarge. The album version of the song was recorded the same day Tupac was released from prison, and was the second song he recorded that day, "Ambitionz Az a Ridah" being the first. As the song was not released as a single in the US, Toss It Up, the lead single for Tupac's next album, The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, was released in the US the following week, and countries that received "I Ain't Mad At Cha" as a single release had to wait until the following month (October) for the release of his next album's single. Writing credits are given to Tupac, Dillinger, Bunny DeBarge and Danny Boy. ==Composition and recording== The day Tupac was released from prison, he went to the studio and recorded "I Ain't Mad at Cha" and "Ambitionz Az a Ridah". When he entered the studio, the beat was already complete, and he wrote the lyrics and recorded the song all in a few hours. Shortly thereafter, Blackstreet released "Don't Leave Me" to the radio, which also interpolates the melody of "A Dream". According to Dave Aron, Tupac had a lot of energy from going into the studio. Kurupt was also in the studio at the time of recording and said that when Tupac heard the beat, he "flipped out" from excitement. He wanted to finish the song quickly and was cursing at the engineers for moving too slow. ==Music video== thumb|right|Music video screenshots For the video, the whole song was re-recorded with a live band. Featuring horns and strings, Kevyn Lewis commissioned a band featuring Cornelius Mims, Warryn Campbell, Priest, Ricky Rouse, and Darryl Crooks to replay the track. The new track was recorded at Can-am Studio by Conley Abrams and was mixed at Larrabee North by Abrams. It was also shot weeks before Tupac's death. The music video begins with Tupac and a friend of his (Bokeem Woodbine) leaving a hotel party at night. While waiting for someone to arrive a hooded man comes up, pulls out a handgun, and starts shooting in their direction. As Tupac pushes them out of the way, he gets hit by at least one bullet. In the ambulance his body gives in and he passes away. Upon entering Heaven, Tupac is told that they have been waiting for him to come for a long time, yet he still has to earn his way in. As a spirit, he then returns to Earth to watch over and guide his friend as he struggles through the next few days. While this is going on Tupac is shown rapping to his friend, (who can't see or hear him) trying to offer guidance. Finally, the video concludes with Tupac's friend gaining the courage to give condolences personally to Tupac's widow and daughter. Look-alikes of many deceased African-American entertainers are revealed to be playing the beat in the party, featuring (among others), Redd Foxx, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, Nat King Cole, Miles Davis, Marvin Gaye, Billie Holiday, Florence Ballard, Sammy Davis Jr., and Louis Armstrong. Danny Boy is also present in Heaven as an angel. In the censored version, the third verse of the song is completely replaced with new lyrics that talk about the struggles of living, God, and life after death. The video ends with the words "Dedicated to Mutulu Shakur and Geronimo Pratt" appearing on the screen. These individuals are Tupac's stepfather and godfather, respectively. The music video was voted #33 on the "MTV Top 100 of 1996" ranking music videos. ===Personnel=== Filming crew *First aired: September 18, 1996 *Filmed: May 15, 1996 *Production company: Been There *Director(s): Tupac Shakur & Kevin Swain *Producer(s): Taj Lewis *Photography: Patrick Loungeway (cinematographer) Additional crew *1st assistant director: Joe Oz ==Live performances== Shakur performed the song live on February 17, 1996 on Saturday Night Live. ==Track listing== ===CD single=== DRWCD5/854 843-2 #"I Ain't Mad at Cha" - Edit #"I Ain't Mad at Cha" - LP Version #"Skandalouz" #"Heartz of Men" ===12" maxi single=== 12 DRW5/854 843-1 #"I Ain't Mad at Cha" - Edit #"I Ain't Mad at Cha" - LP Version #"Skandalouz" #"Heartz of Men" ===Cassette single=== DRWMC5/854 842-4 #"I Ain't Mad At Cha" (Edit) #"Skandalouz" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1996–1997) Peak position Germany (Media Control AG) 26 UK R&B; (Official Charts Company) 3 US Billboard Hot 100 Airplay 58 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1997) Position New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) 23 ===Certifications=== == In popular culture == Rich Juzwiak of Gawker in an article expressed his disappointment in a 2014 musical about Shakur's life, the article titled, "We're Kind of Mad at Cha: The 2Pac Musical Holler If Ya Hear Me". U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder referenced the song in December 2014, when protestors interrupted him while he was giving a speech in Atlanta, Georgia at Ebenezer Baptist Church. In response, Holder stated to the protestors, "I’m not mad at cha". On February 13, 2022, Dr. Dre played the first few notes of ‘I Ain’t Mad At Cha’ on the piano at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show. ==References== Category:1996 singles Category:Tupac Shakur songs Category:Songs released posthumously Category:Contemporary R&B; ballads Category:1996 songs Category:Songs written by Tupac Shakur Category:Death Row Records singles Category:Interscope Records singles Category:Songs written by Danny Boy (singer)

The film crew tried to convince them that they were unaware of the teaser's release on the satellite channel, but the IRIB's television commercial authorities simply asked for a property deed and did nothing more.

However, the agents stated that the age classification is determined by the show licensing council and its inclusion in the poster is the decision of this council. == Selling == Soheil Beirghi announced in the film's press conference that "if sales reach one billion and 10 million tomans, it will enter the profit stage." Therefore, this film, with a profit of 1 billion and 181 million tomans, has been able to more than double its production cost. To sell.

69682249	I Am Zlatan Ibrahimović	I Am Zlatan Ibrahimović () is an autobiography of the Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimović, written alongside the Swedish author David Lagercrantz and first published in Swedish in 2011 by Albert Bonniers Förlag. The book was commercially successful, selling its first edition of 100,000 copies on its first day, and 800,000 by 2017. It was translated into other languages, including a 2013 English translation by Ruth Urbom which was published by Penguin Books. A film based on the book was released in Sweden in 2021, titled I Am Zlatan, directed by Jens Sjögren. ==Synopsis== Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimović tells his life story, starting from his upbringing in Rosengård, a mostly immigrant area of the southern city of Malmö. His Bosniak father and Croat mother marry for residency permits and separate when he is two; his father suffers from alcohol abuse and trauma from his family's suffering in the ongoing Bosnian War, while his mother is at times violent. Segregated from mainstream Swedish society, he finds a way to integrate while a young footballer at Malmö FF, while remaining self-conscious of his differences. In Ibrahimović's account of his one season at FC Barcelona (2009–10), he attacks manager Pep Guardiola, whom he considers indirect, cowardly and inflexible. He praises other managers from his career: Leo Beenhakker (AFC Ajax), Fabio Capello (Juventus) and José Mourinho (Inter Milan), as well as his agent Mino Raiola. ==Release== The full first edition of 100,000 copies sold out in Sweden within hours, a level of interest which was unprecedented for Albert Bonniers Förlag marketing manager Martin Ahlström. A further 100,000 copies were commissioned. It was estimated that by the end of the second edition, the book would have grossed 20 million Swedish kronor. Per the convention of authors taking 30% of the proceeds, Ibrahimović and Lagercrantz would have shared 6 million kronor between themselves. By May 2012, the book had sold over 500,000 copies in Sweden. In Finland, a first edition of 5,200 copies sold out, with 5,000 being considered a bestseller for biographies. In Italy, where Ibrahimović was playing at the time, it sold 140,000 copies in two months, and 35,000 in Norway. It had also been published in the Netherlands, Denmark (straight to number one), Poland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia, with editions scheduled for Hungary, Iceland and Japan. By December 2017, the book had sold over 800,000 copies in Sweden. The book contributed to an increase in reading for young males in the country. ==Reception== ===From players=== In the book, Ibrahimović complains about an unnamed "prima donna" teammate on the Sweden national football team, who would complain that they should train and play like his club, Arsenal. Freddie Ljungberg accused Ibrahimović of using gossip about him to sell a book: "Personally, if I have a problem with people I take it face to face. But clearly, everyone is different. He wrote a book instead". ===From critics=== Martina Montelius of Expressen noted how the book was a reflection of Ibrahimović's individualism and rarely commented on team spirit or playing for Sweden. In her view, the level of honesty was unusual for a Swedish sports autobiography, and more akin to British releases. She commented that the worst recollection of his childhood was not his juvenile delinquency or experiences of child neglect, but his lack of integration; at 13, he did not know who the Swedish 1994 FIFA World Cup semi-finalist Thomas Ravelli was, nor did he watch a Swedish film until he was 20. Simon Kuper of the Financial Times called the book the best recent football autobiography. He likened its narrative to that of the novel Portnoy's Complaint by Philip Roth, in which protagonist Alex Portnoy is a Jewish-American in Newark, New Jersey in the 1930s and 1940s. Both grow up segregated from the mainstream culture, with impoverished and sometimes violent parents. The two protagonists are vaguely aware of warfare occurring in their ancestral country. At 17, both move away and try to integrate into the mainstream culture; both are enchanted by blonde women, but are self-conscious of their differences in speech and appearance. In The Guardian, Richard Williams called the book possibly "most compelling autobiography ever to appear under a footballer's name". He contrasted the book to a recent release by Dennis Bergkamp; the two strikers had completely different upbringings, and endured completely different relationships with their coaches. Richard Herbert of The Independent described the book as "the most compelling autobiography football has known" and called for it to win the William Hill Sports Book of the Year. The English translation was nominated for the 2013 William Hill Sports Book of the Year, losing to Doped, a book on doping in horse racing in the 1960s. Lagercrantz received attention in 2015 when he told the Hay Festival that many of the quotes in the book were his own creations and were not told to him by Ibrahimović. He defended the practice by saying that due to the difference in spoken and written language, it was necessary to modify what had been told to him by the footballer. ==Film== In December 2017, Lagercrantz told Aftonbladet that there would be a film based on the book. Ibrahimović revealed the trailer for the film in July 2021, and it was released in Swedish cinemas that September. ==References== Category:2011 non-fiction books Category:Association football books Category:Swedish autobiographies Category:Sports autobiographies Category:Autobiographies adapted into films Category:Albert Bonniers Förlag books

69968517	I Beg to Differ (This Will Get Better)	"I Beg To Differ (This Will Get Better)" is a song by Canadian punk band Billy Talent. The song was released on April 3, 2020, as the second single from their sixth album, Crisis of Faith. It eventually became the album's third single after the band chose to include a previously non-album single, "Forgiveness I + II", on Crisis of Faith. The song was written by Ben Kowalewicz, Ian D'Sa, Jonathan Gallant, and Jordan Hastings. == Background == "I Beg To Differ (This Will Get Better)" originated from a collection of scratch vocals written by D'Sa. From there, the band transformed those lyrics into a motivational song addressing those close to them suffering from mental illness, and letting them know that everything is going to be alright. > "That message is really important. It was challenging to write, and we > worked really hard on it. Nowadays there's a lot of artists and a lot of > people saying that message in metaphor – and I love that too – but sometimes > it's just nice to just hear it the way it is and be that direct: it will get > better, stick through it.” - Ben Kowalewicz == Release and reception == "I Beg to Differ (This Will Get Better)" was released on April 3, 2020, with many believing that it was released in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Amgad Abdelgadir of Louder Sound called the song "an uplifting belter", while Matt Bobkin of Exclaim! felt the song's message of hope fit well with the pandemic. Mark Sutherland of Kerrang! was a bit more critical of the song for its more pop-centered direction, calling it "radio-friendly sheen and pop positivity". == Personnel == Billy Talent * Ben Kowalewicz - lead vocals, songwriting * Ian D'Sa - guitars, synthesizers, piano, backing vocals, producer * Jonathan Gallant - bass, songwriting * Jordan Hastings - drums, songwriting Production * Eric Ratz - engineering * Ted Jensen - engineering * Chris Lord-Alge - mixing == Charts == Chart (2020) Peak position Canadian Digital Song Sales 34 Canada Rock Chart 1 == References == Category:2020 singles Category:2020 songs Category:Billy Talent songs Category:Songs written by Ian D'Sa Category:Songs written by Benjamin Kowalewicz Category:Songs written by Jonathan Gallant

70007948	I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again	"I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again" is a song by American blues musician Bonnie Raitt from her Nick of Time album. It was written by David Lasley and Julie Lasley. Raitt sings the song accompanied by Herbie Hancock, playing solo piano. It was produced by Don Was, engineered and mixed by Ed Cherney. == Background == Lasley had persuaded a security guard to give Raitt a cassette with his song "I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again", which she took home with her. He related in an interview how sometime later, the tape fell on her head from a box in her closet. In making the album, Raitt was not concerned with making a commercial album. Her management, the record company and she felt that if she made a record that was artistically true, picking songs that she liked from the heart, it would work. She commented "I waited a long time to be grown-up enough to sing [it]". "Every song on there is about somebody who had to have lived this long." Raitt wasn't concerned with how the songs fit together or that "on the Herbie Hancock one ["I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again"] everyone's gonna think I'm tryin' to be too like Linda Ronstadt." Raitt adamantly said, "If anybody had any doubts about how I feel, they can just listen to those three songs," citing "I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again"..."The songs are cathartic and I will be not denied. I will get what I deserve. When you get beat up, you eventually stop taking it.". == Recording == Herbie Hancock was Raitt's first choice to accompany her on piano and he agreed. They recorded the song at Capitol Studio B with Don Was producing and Ed Cherney engineering. Raitt described "I’d never recorded with Herbie before, or done anything that exciting as far as being, “On your mark, get set, go” with one of the great geniuses of forever. It was a very stretching and exciting and hairy and rewarding session." They recorded two takes, the first longer and the second, shorter. "We did a couple takes only, because it's such an emotionally wrenching song." > "The song is just a jewel. I mean every word I sing, and I pick songs where > I have to really mean every lyric — and this one I had been meaning for a > long time [laughs]. I’d been wanting to record it for at least 15 years." - > Bonnie Raitt "The only fixes we had to do on the vocal...are the couple of > lines where she started crying while we were doing it" - Don Was == Composition and style == The recording is rootsy and stripped-down, Hancock on piano accompanying Raitt singing a woeful ballad. == Critical reception == Pacific Stars And Stripes cites three titles writing: "Nick of Time contains music worthy of such titles as..."I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again". Jeff Turrentine, for the Austin Daily Texan, wrote "even more genuinely soulful are Raitt's torchy, plaintive ballads of lost love...Raitt tells her sad tale as Herbie Hancock provides a lush blanket of chords, and one can almost imagine her reclining atop the Steinway in some smokey barroom." Dick Hogan of the Cedar Rapids Gazette describes "Bonnie spins a tale of woe over Herbie Hancock's lone piano" == Covers == * Louise Setara * Jane Monheit == References == == External links == * * Category:Bonnie Raitt songs Category:Song recordings produced by Don Was Category:1980s ballads Category:1989 songs Category:Pop ballads Category:Songs written by David Lasley Category:Torch songs Category:Songs about heartache
7003765	I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)	"I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)" is a single recorded by the Temptations and released on Motown Records' Gordy label during the spring of 1968. The song is the last with lyrics by Rodger Penzabene, and as the final Temptations single to feature David Ruffin as lead singer. Both "I Could Never Love Another" and the previous Temptations release, "I Wish It Would Rain", drew from Penzabene's real-life heart break over learning that his wife had been unfaithful. Unable to handle the extreme pain and unable to leave his wife, he wrote the songs as personal statements to her, publicizing the pain she caused him. After both songs were completed and recorded, Penzabene committed suicide. David Ruffin portrays the narrator of "I Could Never Love Another", who asks his wife why she is suddenly ending their relationship after all their years together and all her proclamations of love. He then tells her that despite her infidelity, despite all the pain she's caused him, he'll never find love with another woman. "I Could Never Love Another" proved to be Ruffin's final performance as lead singer on a Temptations single, as Ruffin was fired from the group in June 1968 for what was considered increasingly unprofessional behavior and ego clashes. "I Could Never Love Another" was the second single from the 1968 album The Temptations Wish It Would Rain. It peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reached the number-one position on the Billboard R&B; Singles chart. Following one more single from the LP, the Eddie Kendricks-led "Please Return Your Love to Me", the Temptations forged ahead into psychedelic soul territory with their new single, "Cloud Nine", and their new lead singer, Dennis Edwards. Billboard described the single as "another sure-fire winner." Cash Box described it as "pop-styled blues" with "outstanding lead, delightful backup vocals and a terrific orchestral impact." ==Personnel== * Lead vocals by David Ruffin * Background vocals by Eddie Kendricks, Melvin Franklin, Paul Williams, and Otis Williams * Written by Norman Whitfield, Barrett Strong, and Rodger Penzabene * Produced by Norman Whitfield * Instrumentation by The Funk Brothers ==References== Category:1968 singles Category:The Temptations songs Category:Songs written by Barrett Strong Category:Songs written by Norman Whitfield Category:Songs written by Rodger Penzabene Category:Gordy Records singles Category:Torch songs Category:1968 songs

Ben Robbins and Steve Hart both wrote the original songs "The Star in You" and "All Because of You". Both of the songs have a pop-like arrangement but are sung operatically in English.

708280	I Am My Own Wife	I Am My Own Wife is a play by Doug Wright based on his conversations with the German antiquarian Charlotte von Mahlsdorf. The one-man play premiered Off- Broadway in 2003 at Playwrights Horizons. It opened on Broadway later that year. The play was developed with Moisés Kaufman and his Tectonic Theater Project, and Kaufman also acted as director. Jefferson Mays starred in the Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, playing some forty roles. Wright received the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work. With his play I Am My Own Wife, Wright tied in with the film I Am My Own Woman by avant-garde director Rosa von Praunheim (1992).

It was first produced as a workshop in July 2001 at the La Jolla Playhouse in La Jolla CA.La Jolla Playhouse Workshops Wright's I Am My Own Wife July 10-29|Playbill ==Premieres== In 2004, the play had its European premiere at Stockholms Stadsteater, Stockholm, starring Björn Kjellman. In 2005, it had its American regional premiere at Ensemble Theatre of Cincinnati, starring Todd Almond. That production then traveled to Actors Theatre of Louisville and Florida Studio Theatre. In 2006, the play was staged in Hudson, New York at Stageworks/Hudson starring Broadway actor Jeffrey Kuhn, in Toronto, Ontario, at CanStage, with Stephen Ouimette in the starring role, in Vancouver, British Columbia, at the Playhouse Theatre with Canadian actor Tom Rooney, at the Saidye Bronfman Centre in Montreal with actor Brett Christopher, in Portland, Oregon, at the Gerding Theater starring actor Wade McCollum, in Portland, Maine, at the Portland Stage Company starring actor Tom Ford, and in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the Performance Network Theatre starring actor Malcolm Tulip. In January 2007, the San Pedro Playhouse in San Antonio, Texas successfully mounted the play. It was also performed at the George Street Playhouse, New Brunswick, New Jersey from January 16, 2007, to February 11, 2007. It featured Mark Nelson, and was directed by Anders Cato. Vince Gatton performed the role in a production directed by Andrew Volkoff at Barrington Stage Company in 2008. A French translation (Ma femme, c'est moi) was performed in February 2009 at Théâtre du Rideau Vert in Montreal. It also ran at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia, starring Helen Hayes award winner Andrew Long, and directed by Alan Paul, and at Theater Three in Port Jefferson, New York, featuring Jeffrey Sanzel. Between May 6 and May 23, 2009, it played in Tasmania at the Earl Arts Centre in Launceston, and the Theatre Royal, Hobart Backspace, produced by the Tasmanian Theatre Company and featuring Robert Jarman. In the Czech Republic, the play was premiered in 2008 by Divadlo Letí in Prague, starring Pavol Smolárik. At the same time it was also staged by a Czech non-professional theater group with Libor Ulovec in the role. The latter was awarded the Best Czech Non-Professional Drama Performance 2009 and Libor Ulovec received (among others) the Best Czech Non-Professional Actor Prize 2009. In Mexico it is starring by the actor Hector Bonilla who, on January 23, 2010, accomplished 100 performances, with 89 standing ovations by that time. It was also performed in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, at Gettysburg Stage starring actor Eric Jones. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the play was part of the renowned Jungle Theater's 2011-2012 season. It was directed by Joel Sass in that venue, and Bradley Greenwald embodied the stageful of characters in an amazing tour de force performance. It ran from November 4 though December 18. In Greece, I Am My Own Wife had its premiere in January 2011, in Bios Basement, Athens. It was produced by Degreezero Theatre Company, translated and directed by Iossif Vardakis and performed by Haris Attonis with the original music of Marietta Fafouti who also composed a special song for the show, named "Ich Erinnere Mich" — lyrics by Dimitris Dimopoulos. It went on for 20 performances and carried on for the following season, moving to 104 theatre, in Athens and opening in November 2011 for the second run. It has received great acceptance and outstanding critiques both for the whole of the show but for Haris Attonis' exceptional performance, as well. The play itself and the story of Charlotte are very well-timed with the political and social situation in Greece. The staging itself is very minimal and it has been considered to be one of the most emotional presentations, internationally and there have been innovations like the beard and the lack of the head scarf, for the very first time.

70857780	I Ain't Worried	"I Ain't Worried" is a song by American pop rock band OneRepublic, released on May 13, 2022, through Mosley Music Group and Interscope Records. It is the second and final single to the soundtrack for the film Top Gun: Maverick (2022). The song was written and produced by Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, and Tyler Spry, with production from Simon Oscroft and John Nathaniel. The song also contains elements of Peter Bjorn and John's 2006 hit single "Young Folks" and features background vocals from Tedder's son; Copeland Tedder. Copeland Tedder is the only other background voice apart from his dad, Ryan Tedder. OneRepublic was the only band to present an original song for the film. The track debuted on the UK Singles Chart on June 3 and on the Irish Singles Chart on June 10, climbing positions until it peaked in the UK top three and the Ireland top five. It became the band's biggest hit in the UK since "Love Runs Out" (2014). "I Ain't Worried" debuted at number 76 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number 6, becoming their fourth top ten hit there. While on the Canadian Hot 100 the song debuted at number 41 and peaked at number 3. "I Ain't Worried" also peaked at number 1 in Belgium, Hungary, Iceland and New Zealand, and reached the top ten in other countries, including Australia, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Japan, Lebanon, Lithuania, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland and Taiwan. Upon release, "I Ain't Worried" received highly positive reviews from music critics, being praised for its sunny production and upbeat melody. ==Background and music== In an interview with Ryan Seacrest on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Tedder revealed that the idea for the song started during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic after one of his friends at Paramount Pictures invited him to participate in the soundtrack of the new Top Gun. At that time, Tom Cruise had turned down about thirty songs for the soundtrack, and was looking for a band to create an original song for the new film, specifically for the beach scene. Tedder said that "I Ain't Worried" was "written with the characters in mind relaxing and having fun in the scene for the first time in those two hours of film", making the song manage to make the scene memorable in its own way and at the same time fit in with the action and emotion scenes throughout the film. The band recorded the song during the 2021 MTV Europe Music Awards in November at the Kempinski Hotel Corvinus in Budapest, where they stayed during the song's release on May 13. The song also featured the band's frontman Ryan Tedder's son Copeland, who was credited as one of the backing vocals. Following the release of the lead single from the Top Gun: Maverick soundtrack "Hold My Hand" on May 3, "I Ain't Worried" was officially released as the second single on May 13 by Interscope Records and Mosley Music Group, the label on which the band is part. The song, along with its music video directed by Isaac Rentz, made its global debut on MTV Live and MTVU, as well as on the billboards of the Paramount Theater Manhattan on Times Square. "I Ain't Worried" appears during the scene where Maverick and his students play football at a beach. Tedder felt that illustrating the song worked with the film was important, given the traditional Hollywood wisdom that "you can lose a song if it doesn’t play to picture." Given the film's secrecy, Tedder found this hard to convey: initially, they were not allowed a copy of the segment they were writing for. In a Zoom call, he was played footage from the scene, and decided to take matters into his own hands: he used his smartphone to record the scene from his computer screen, and then edited that sequence to the song himself with help from his co-writers. "We edited it, trying to guess what the film editor himself or herself would do," he explained to Variety. Cruise was thrilled with the results, and found Tedder's determination riotously funny, remarking, "Well, that's a first." Tedder estimated that most of his edit made it into the film unaltered. ==Critical reception== "I Ain't Worried" attracted widespread praise from music critics. Greta Brereton of NME praised Tedder's vocals on the song, also highlighting the song's fast-paced melody and upbeat pop production, in contrast to Lady Gaga's song for the soundtrack, "Hold My Hand". In a Billboard article, Hannah Dailey praised the song's lyrical content and laid-back style, citing that they "uniquely connect with the atmosphere of the movie scene in which the song makes its presence". Writing for The Charlotte Observer, Théoden James said the beat and vocals of song is a "super-infectious bubblegum" and a "pop perfection in general". Tyler Golsen from Far Out Magazine wrote that I Ain’t Worried' doesn’t have enough length or substance to be considered annoying. It’s just a brief slice of pop music nothingness: sunny, breezy, light, and utterly forgettable", but praised the song's melody, saying "Granted, something scratches at the back of your ears when you put the song. Chalk that up to super technician Ryan Tedder, who can make a memorable melody out of just about anything". ==Music video== The accompanying music video was directed by Isaac Rentz, best known for directing the music videos of "She's Kinda Hot" by 5 Seconds of Summer and "Hey Hey Hey" by Katy Perry. The music video was released on May 13, 2022, alongside the song, and was shown in major theaters across the United States. The band performs on the palm tree-covered outdoor stage under the sunset, with the images interspersed with a few clips from the film every now and then. ==Live performances== To promote the film and song with the release of its soundtrack, OneRepublic performed "I Ain't Worried" for the first time on May 28, 2022, on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The band performed the song for the second time on Good Morning America (GMA) held on July 15, 2022, at Times Square Studios in Manhattan. The song was also a regular part of band setlist for the Never Ending Summer Tour. After the tour, on October 5, 2022, the band performed the song once again during The Late Late Show with James Corden. On November 13, 2022, the band performed "I Ain't Worried" at the 2022 MTV Europe Music Awards. ==Personnel== * Ryan Tedder – vocals, songwriter, production, vocal production * Tyler Spry – songwriter, production, guitar, background vocals * Brent Kutzle – songwriter, production * Simon Oscroft – production, guitar * John Nathaniel – co-production, mixing, background vocals * John Eriksson – songwriter * Peter Morén – songwriter * Björn Yttling – songwriter * Chris Gehringer – mastering * Brandon Collins – additional programming * Copeland Tedder – main background vocals ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart performance for "I Ain't Worried" Chart (2022–2023) Peak position Brazil (Pop Internacional) 9 Bulgaria (PROPHON) 2 Croatia (HRT) 22 Denmark (Tracklisten) 12 France (SNEP) 7 Greece International (IFPI) 10 Iceland (Plötutíðindi) 1 Italy (FIMI) 49 Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard Japan) 3 Latvia (LAIPA) 15 Lebanon (Lebanese Top 20) 2 Lithuania (AGATA) 5 Malaysia International (RIM) 3 New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) 1 Norway (VG-lista) 9 Poland (Polish Streaming Top 100) 31 Singapore (RIAS) 3 Slovakia (Singles Digitál Top 100) 6 South Africa (RISA) 10 South Korea (Billboard) 8 South Korea (Circle) 58 Spain (PROMUSICAE) 87 Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) 25 Taiwan (Billboard) 6 ===Monthly charts=== Monthly chart performance for "I Ain't Worried" Chart (2022) Position Russia Airplay (TopHit) 9 South Korea (Circle) 63 ===Year-end charts=== 2022 year-end chart performance for "I Ain't Worried" Chart (2022) Position Australia (ARIA) 9 Austria (Ö3 Austria Top 40) 45 Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) 33 Belgium (Ultratop 50 Wallonia) 16 Canada (Canadian Hot 100) 27 Denmark (Tracklisten) 47 Germany (Official German Charts) 58 Global 200 (Billboard) 43 Hungary (Single Top 40) 13 Hungary (Stream Top 40) 40 Lithuania (Agata) 22 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 12 Netherlands (Single Top 100) 27 New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) 13 Poland (ZPAV) 62 Russia Airplay (TopHit) 60 South Korea (Circle) 167 Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) 94 Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) 22 UK Singles (OCC) 20 US Billboard Hot 100 37 US Adult Contemporary (Billboard) 41 US Adult Top 40 (Billboard) 17 US Mainstream Top 40 (Billboard) 25 ==Certifications== ==Release history== Release history for "I Ain't Worried" Region Date Format Version Label Various May 13, 2022 Original United States June 21, 2022 Contemporary hit radio Interscope France July 10, 2022 Radio airplay Universal Italy July 18, 2022 Various August 5, 2022 Acoustic version May 12, 2023 Versions ==References== Category:2022 singles Category:2022 songs Category:Interscope Records singles Category:Mosley Music Group singles Category:Number-one singles in Iceland Category:Number-one singles in New Zealand Category:OneRepublic songs Category:Songs from Top Gun Category:Songs written by Ryan Tedder Category:Songs written by Brent Kutzle Category:Songs written by Björn Yttling Category:Song recordings produced by Ryan Tedder Category:Songs written for films Category:Ultratop 50 Singles (Wallonia) number-one singles Category:Becky G songs

71045693	I Choose You (Grey's Anatomy)	"I Choose You" is the third episode of the twelfth season of the American television medical drama Grey's Anatomy, and the show's 248th episode overall. It was written by William Harper and directed by Rob Corn. It aired on the American Broadcasting Company in the United States on October 8, 2015. In the episode, Dr. Jo Wilson expresses uncertainty about the future of her relationship with Alex Karev after discovering evidence he may have children with Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl). She confides in her close friend, Dr. Stephanie Edwards (Jerrika Hinton) about this. Meanwhile, Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) re-evaluates her life choices after receiving an invitation to her ex-boyfriend's wedding. Richard Webber questions Chief Miranda Bailey's loyalty, and Alex struggles with a decision that will affect the lives of newborn twins. The episode picks up on an unresolved storyline from the fifth season episode, "Elevator Love Letter". The storyline is subsequently resolved in the season 16 episode, "Leave a Light On" which coincided with Chambers' character's departure from the series. Kim Raver (Dr. Teddy Altman) reprised her role as a guest-star, in addition to Jesse Williams (Dr. Jackson Avery) and Mitch Pileggi (Larry Jennings). The title of the episode is a reference to the song "I Choose You" by American musician Sara Bareilles. "I Choose You" was well-received by television critics. Upon its initial airing, the episode was viewed by 8.12 million Americans, ranked #2 in its time-slot, and garnered a 2.2/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic. ==Plot== The episode begins with a traditional voiceover by general surgeon Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), where she states the body is a bundle of possibility. She states, "Every time we cut one open, we're faced with a series of decisions. Some choices are made for you. But for the most part, surgery is a choose your own adventure. When you're faced with the tough choices, it comes down to you. What can you live with? What can you leave behind? Right or wrong, you have to decide what you're willing to go down fighting for. The choice is yours." She carpools with sisters, Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) and Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone), but expresses annoyance over both Amelia's nakedness changing in the car, stating her children sit in that seat, and Maggie's denial over a wide-eyed expression reading a notice for Meredith's promotion as Head of General following Bailey's promotion as Chief of Surgery. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.) overhears Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) inform Meredith she has been lowballed regarding her new salary as head of general surgery. Callie and the sisters urge Meredith to renegotiate her salary as they chat in her house. Maggie expresses apprehension about her invitation to ex-boyfriend, Dr. Ethan Boyd (Lance Gross)'s wedding, culminating in her kissing Andrew DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti) at Joe (Steven W. Bailey)'s bar. Dr. Arizona Robbins is a consult on an OB/GYN case involving a pregnant mother of twins, Laurie Kiefer (Jennifer Marsala). Robbins pages Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), head of pediatrics. Laurie delivers fraternal twins, a girl and a boy, but both children are severely jaundiced and need extra care. DeLuca asks why Robbins and Karev are shocked, and Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) explains both fraternal twins have a tumor, and now they must tell the parents their twins are dying. They reveal the kids need liver transplants and Alex informs the parents that he will decide which child will have a donour, based on the strength of the child. In the bathroom, surgical resident Dr. Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington) feels sick about information she has found out in the morning. Stephanie Edwards (Hinton) states she needs to tell Alex. In the hospital elevator, Jo awkwardly asks Alex if he wants kids, much to his confusion. Arizona suggests Jo may be pregnant, and withdrawing from telling him. When Alex comes home after staying up all night to make contacts for the less healthy twin getting a donor, Jo confronts Alex with an invoice from the fertility clinic about his embryos with Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) seven years prior. She questions her value in their relationship in comparison to his previous relationship with Izzie, feeling she was worth it to him. The two reconcile the argument, as Alex pulls down his pants to "make a baby" and Jo laughs at the propesterousness of the idea, stating she is in the middle of her residency and he is never home. He climbs on the bed on top of her, as both laugh and giggle. Meanwhile, Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) expresses frustrations with Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) who has returned from the army, stating he is changing the locks and wants a divorce. April urges him not to. The next day, she returns, planning to thank him, only to discover Jackson has moved out to live with Ben and Bailey instead. ==Production== The episode was written by William Harper and directed by Rob Corn. The episode is designed with a misdirect storyline, making the viewer assume Camilla Luddington's character feels sick due to being pregnant. However, she eventually reveals she has found an invoice from the fertility clinic of Alex and Izzie's embryos. Previously, Luddington asked whether Jo had been aware of the embryos and said that it could "potentially be a big issue" in a 2015 interview at San Diego Comic Con. ==Reception== === Broadcasting === "I Choose You" was first broadcast on October 8, 2015 in the United States on ABC. The episode was viewed by a total of 8.1 million Americans, In terms of viewership, the episode adjusted upwards for viewership, alongside How to Get Away with Murder, the only scripted shows to do so. === Critical reception === The episode was well-received by television critics. Many singled out Chambers' character, Alex Karev and his series long character development. However, the appearance of the sick jaundiced child was negatively received by multiple critics, and described by one critic as the child resembling an "oversized Sour Patch Kid". Several critics noted the remembrance of Heigl's former character. TVFanatic critic Ashley Bissette Sumerel expressed surprise the episode "even reminds us about the fact that Izzie used to exist". Hollywood Life's Chris Rogers commented, "Damn you, Shonda Rhimes — you get us every time! We've been dying for an Izzie Stevens comeback since she left Grey's Anatomy in 2010, so just the mere mention of her name on the Oct. 8 episode was a tease we almost couldn't handle. And now, there's a perfect reason for her to return." For Cosmopolitan, Lauren Hoffman noted April Kepner (Sarah Drew) as "creepy", pointing out a Fatal Attraction reference made by Jesse Williams' character, Jackson Avery. Andy Patrick for TVLine noted how the episode subverted expectations by making the viewer assume Jo was pregnant in the bathroom scene with Stephanie, before revealing she had found the embryos with Izzie. She described the episode as "belonging to Alex Karev" and praised his development as a "smartass kid from an abusive household in Iowa who somehow grew up into this mature, whip-smart surgeon." She stated, "The father can donate his liver to one of them, and Alex say's he'll be the one to decide." Ariana Bacle for Entertainment Weekly felt that Grey's had gone "Sophie's Choice" and it was "not fun" watching the choice made to save the healthier twin baby. However, Hoffman felt "What follows is less "Alex's Choice" and more a showcase of who Alex has become. He calms the parents' fears. He commands the team of doctors working to save the babies and perform surgery on the dad. He researches, tirelessly. And finally, after tests on tests, he chooses the girl twin for the transplant." Brittany Lovely for Hypable commented on Alex's growth, stating, "Alex is no longer a toddler finding his way around the hospital, he is taking on the parental role and guiding by example." For TVFanatic, Ashley Bissette Sumerel gave a 4.7 out of 5.0 rating and praised Chambers' character Alex as having "probably grown more than any other character". She stated, "THIS is how Grey's Anatomy is supposed to be". Complimenting the season as a whole, she stated: "So far, this season has done exactly as we hoped it would, reminding us of all the reasons we used to love this show." She further commented on the series having "gone back to its roots, with the kinds of stories and the kind of tone we fell in love with way back when", and complimented the decision to move the sisters back to Meredith's old house." Bacle praised Maggie's rant to Meredith drinking wine calling herself an "alien with no home and she wants to have sex", and called it "probably the most entertaining monologue to appear on Grey’s in the history of Grey’s. More drunken alien-focused rants from Maggie, please!" Regarding Meredith's decision to request for a higher salary, she pondered, "Do these more politically minded plotlines sometimes come off a little forced, a little cheesy? Sure. But they’re also inspiring in their Grey’s-specific, I’m-going-to-show-you-all-my-emotions-and-hope-that-works-in- my-favor way. And that is what makes Grey’s Grey’s, for better or for worse. So keep rising, Meredith. Keep rising." ==References== ==External links== * Category:Grey's Anatomy (season 12) episodes Category:2015 American television episodes

71303402	I Am More Than a Wolf Whistle	I Am More than a Wolf Whistle: The Story of Carolyn Bryant Donham is a memoir by American author Carolyn Bryant Donham, the white woman who accused the African-American 14-year-old Emmett Till of touching her hand and flirting with her at her store in 1955, an incident which led to his lynching. Written before 2008, the manuscript was originally planned for a 2036 posthumous release, but leaked by historian Timothy Tyson and released to the public in July 2022. ==Background and release== Emmett Till, a 14-year old African- American resident of Chicago, visited relatives in Mississippi in 1955. He visited a grocery store in Money, Mississippi called Bryant's Grocery, which was owned by Donham and her husband Roy Bryant, both of whom were white. Till offended Donham in some way, though accounts of the events differ. After hearing about the interaction, Donham's husband Roy and Roy's half-brother John William "J. W." Milam, with her assistance, kidnapped, tortured, and lynched Till. The book was dictated by Donham to her daughter-in-law Marsha Bryant, who transcribed the recollections. The manuscript is also dedicated to Marsha. The public first learned of the book when historian Timothy Tyson interviewed Donham in 2008. Donham made an agreement with Tyson during the interview process that the book would not be released until 2036. She gave a copy of the book to Tyson, who in turn gave it to the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina, where it was held in their archives. Till's cousin and civil rights activist Deborah Watts called for the release of the manuscript in 2021 in an op-ed for USA Today, hoping its release would lead to Donham's indictment. In July 2022, an unserved arrest warrant for Donham was found by the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation in a Mississippi County Courthouse basement. The discovery led to renewed calls for her arrest, which gained traction and coverage. Tyson released a copy of the manuscript to the FBI and subsequently to newspaper outlets, saying "The potential for an investigation was more important than the archival agreements, though those are important things. But this is probably the last chance for an indictment in this case." After the release of the manuscript, Tyson said he has not spoken to Donham since the interview in 2008. Donham was 88 years old at the time of the book's release. Journalist Stacey Patton from NewsOne, a division of Urban One, first broke the story of the manuscript, which quickly spread; PDFs were subsequently posted online. ==Content== The 99-page manuscript focuses on two main aspects of Donham's life. The first third of the book focuses on her early life in the South, including her childhood being raised on the Archer Plantation outside of Cruger, Mississippi. Donham recalls her "hired help" Annie Freeman, whom she said she loved, recounting Freeman had skin "the color of hot chocolate". The recollections continue with Donham's boyfriend at the time showing her a "hanging tree", which Donham remembered would be a "terrific tree to climb" if she were a tomboy. The last two-thirds of the book focus on the interaction, aftermath, trial, and subsequent developments of the Till events. The book ends with the paragraph: ==Reception and response== The book received an overwhelmingly negative response, with a number of writers and historians noting the inconsistencies, historical revisionism, and lack of contrition by Donham. Jerry Mitchell from the Mississippi Center For Investigative Reporting pointed out a number of inconsistencies in the book, writing in his article for The Boston Globe that Donham "conjures the 'black beast rapist' mythology". Natasha Decker from MadameNoire said the memoir contained "shocking new information... but not one of thorough confession, self- accountability, or guilt." Author and historian Chris Benson, who co-wrote the book A Few Days Full of Trouble on Till's lynching, said Donham's book has "several key contradictions" and the public will likely be "outraged" by her unrepentance. NewsOne's Patton described Donham as 'racist' and additionally wrote: Filmmaker Keith Beauchamp, who directed the documentary The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till, said "I'm totally disturbed and outraged by what I've read. This so-called memoir gives us further proof of Carolyn Bryant's culpability in the kidnapping and murder of Emmett Till." Online magazine Bossip wrote the book was a "malevolent manifesto" and called for Donham to be jailed. Journalist Charles M. Blow wrote an op-ed for the New York Times in which he lambasted Donham and the memoir, writing, "She has failed at every turn to offer a redeeming word or action for the boy's murder and her part in it. The words we've seen in this memoir don't cut it." ==Aftermath== Shortly after the memoir was leaked, an attempt was made to indict Donham on charges of kidnapping and manslaughter. On August 9, 2022, after hearing more than seven hours of testimony from investigators and witnesses, a grand jury in Mississippi declined to indict Donham. Donham died on April 25, 2023. ==References== Category:English-language books Category:Emmett Till Category:Non-fiction books about murders in the United States Category:Anti- black racism in the United States Category:False allegations of sex crimes Category:American memoirs

71699827	I Came By	I Came By is a 2022 British crime thriller film written, co-produced and directed by British-Iranian filmmaker Babak Anvari. The film stars George MacKay, Percelle Ascott, Kelly Macdonald, and Hugh Bonneville. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 19 August 2022, before its streaming release on 31 August 2022, by Netflix. ==Plot== Toby Nealey is a politically minded, 23-year-old graffiti artist who breaks into the homes of upper-class individuals and leaves behind the message "I CAME BY" on the walls. His latest target is retired judge Hector Blake. Despite the judge appearing socially progressive in public, Toby believes him to be a hypocrite. When Toby enters Blake’s house, he discovers a pottery studio and an imprisoned man in the basement. Toby tries to tell his friend and former accomplice, Jay, about what he found. However, Jay is distracted by personal troubles with his pregnant girlfriend, Naz. Toby anonymously calls the police, but they find nothing in Blake's house and leave. Lizzie, Toby's widowed mother, has grown increasingly worried about her son's lack of direction. When she and Toby get into a shouting match, she throws him out of the house. Toby returns to Blake's residence to free the prisoner, but Blake murders Toby with a cricket bat. He then uses the kiln in his studio to cremate Toby's body, and flushes the ashes down the toilet. Jay is reluctant to disclose his graffiti activities with Toby, but plants a letter addressed to Blake in Toby’s room. The letter spurs the police to visit Blake's home again and they find the basement prison, which he claims is a “panic room.” Blake is arrested for obstructing the investigation, but uses his connections to get released quickly. Lizzie begins following Blake. She witnesses him bring a man to his house: Omid, a gay Iranian asylum seeker. Blake has offered to help him get permanent residency in the UK. Blake recalls how his cruel father took an Indo-Persian man as a lover, and this led to Blake's distraught mother's suicide. The teenage Blake eventually assaulted and nearly killed his father’s lover. Despite being drugged, Omid manages to escape. However, he does not go to the police due to his precarious residential status. The next day, Blake tracks down, threatens, imprisons, and murders Omid. Increasingly desperate, Lizzie asks Jay to help her break into Blake's house. Jay refuses because he is a black man with prior charges, and is responsible for his newborn son. Lizzie enters Blake's house alone, only to be caught, murdered, and cremated. When Jay goes looking for Lizzie, he realizes she is dead and blames himself. Jay and Naz's relationship falls apart due to his lack of communication. Sometime later, Naz informs Jay that Blake is going to attend the Birlstone School's tercentenary anniversary celebration. After Blake leaves the event, Jay follows him to a country estate. Jay fights and subdues Blake. Jay then goes to the pottery studio in the estate’s garage and finds a prisoner. Jay calls the police, frees the prisoner, and flees the scene. The police arrive and find Blake bloodied and restrained in the house. On the wall, Jay has left behind graffiti reading "I CAME BY." ==Cast== == Reception == The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 70% of 40 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.80/10. The website's critics' consensus reads, "Although it falls a fair bit shy of its Hitchcockian ambitions, I Came By gets a major boost from Hugh Bonneville's excellent against-type performance." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 57 out of 100 based on 10 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews". John Nugent for Empire Magazine praised Bonneville's performance, but criticised the blunt political messaging, described the cinematography as "flat," and the final product as "messy." Noel Murray similarly praised Bonneville in The Los Angeles Times, and noted that the narrative's shift to different characters kept the film "unpredictable," but also harmed the pacing and tension. Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com felt the film was too ambitious, and had "the opposite problem of so many mini- series on the streaming service in that it has a TV season worth of ideas crammed into its runtime." Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent similarly critiqued the lack of focus in the film's messages, stating it was "a well- intentioned work scrambling to find its voice." == References == == External links == * * * * Category:2022 films Category:2022 crime films Category:2020s British films Category:2020s English-language films Category:2022 thriller films Category:2022 crime thriller films Category:British crime thriller films Category:Films set in England Category:Films set in London Category:English- language Netflix original films Category:Film4 Productions films Category:Regency Enterprises films

72374698	I Congress of the Communist Party of Italy	thumb|Plaque commemorating the birth of the PCdI affixed in 1949 at the San Marco theatre, Livorno The I Congress of the Communist Party of Italy was held in Livorno on 21 January 1921, following the split of the communist fraction at the end of the XVII Congress of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). ==Background== The Italian Socialist Party (PSI) joined the Communist International in 1919. Although the party had adopted left-wing positions against the First World War it nevertheless contained a broad range of political opinions. While the majority of the party was pro-Bolshevik by 1919, a strong reformist right wing remained within the party, led by one if its founders, the leader of the parliamentary group Filippo Turati. Giacinto Menotti Serrati, leader of the majority grouping in the PSI, had led the party into the Comintern but was nevertheless opposed to expelling right wing figures, fearing this would alienate a large section of the party’s supporters. The uneasy internal arrangements of the party were upset by the II Congress of the Comintern in July and August 1920, which laid down 21 conditions for all parties to remain within the International; one of the conditions was that all reformists - such as Turati - were to be expelled. In September 1920, the left wing of the PSI secured approval for an agenda for its forthcoming XVII Congress signed by which proposed the complete and unconditional adoption of the Comintern’s 21 points. ==The communist fraction== thumb|Amadeo Bordiga thumb|Antonio Gramsci Within the PSI the two main leaders of the communist fraction were Amadeo Bordiga and Antonio Gramsci. They mobilised their supporters in the months before the Congress to follow the Comintern line and expel the right-wingers. The fraction agreed a manifesto-programme signed in Milan on 15 October 1920 by Bordiga, Gramsci, Misiano, Terracini, Bombacci, Repossi, Fortichiari and Polano. A few days later the fraction gained the approval of Zinoviev who, also on behalf of Lenin, Trotsky and Bukharin, underlining how it constituted the only support of the International in Italy. The motion that the communists intended to present to the Congress was ratified in a conference held at the Municipal Theater of Imola between 28 and 29 November, and for this reason it was also called the Imola motion. The text aimed at the transformation of the Socialist Party into a Communist Party, making it necessary to exclude all those who voted in the Congress "against the Communist program of the Party and against the commitment to complete observance of the 21 conditions of admission to the International». The Imola conference did not explicitly deal with the path to follow in the event that the motion remained in the minority at the congress, but the hypothesis of the split was already concretely outlined. ==The PSI Congress== The debate at the Socialist Party Congress took place in a particularly turbulent climate and interruptions and tumults were frequent. The International delegates, Khristo Kabakchiev and Mátyás Rákosi, supported the motion from the Communist fraction, harshly attacking Serrati. Their support was not however sufficient to prevent the majority of Congress delegates from supporting an alternative motion from Serrati, emphasising the importance of maintaining party unity and rejecting expulsions. On the morning of 21 January 1921, the declaration of the results of the voting made clear that the Communist fraction’s motion had not succeeded, while Serrati’s opposition to expulsions commanded the support of the party. Bordiga therefore proceeded to formalize a split of the Communist fraction from the rest of the party. ==The birth of the PCd'I== thumb|Front page of L'Ordine Nuovo of 22 January 1921 with an account of the birth of the Communist Party of Italy The delegates of the communist fraction walked out if the PSI Congress singing of the Internationale and, following Bordiga, proceeded to hold the founding Congress of the Communist Party at the :it:Teatro San Marco. It was a makeshift arrangement: the building, used as a warehouse for materials of the Royal Italian Army during the First World War, had no seats, and the delegates sheltered with umbrellas from the rain that entered through the broken glass of the windows and from the holes in the roof. thumb|Flag of the Livorno section of the Communist Party of Italy , preserved in the local Museum of the City The Congress was held over two sessions during the single day of Friday 21 January, and limited itself to giving the new party an initial organizational framework. The morning session hosted the greetings of the foreign delegates Kabakchiev, Rosa Bloch, Jules Humbert-Droz, Balfour, :de:Paul Böttcher and Arvid G. Hansen and the interventions of Bruno Fortichiari on behalf of the Central Committee of the fraction; by Luigi Polano for the young people; by Ortensia De Meo for the women and four workers and trade unionists. In the second session, an agenda signed by Fortichiari was voted on which declared the Communist Party of Italy (PCd’I) - Section of the Communist International established. This name would remain in force until the dissolution of the International in 1943, when the party re-emerged under the name of the Italian Communist Party after being forced underground in 1926 by the Fascist regime. The congress chose Milan as the headquarters of the party and, as its official organ, the biweekly Communist. Finally the Central Committee was elected, consisting of Bordiga, Grieco, Parodi, Sessa, Tarsia, Polano, Gramsci, Terracini, Belloni, Bombacci, Gennari, Misiano, Marabini, Repossi and Fortichiari. The role of general secretary was not established, although it was in fact fulfilled by Bordiga. The establishment of the PCd'I was completed a few days later, on 27 January, with the Florence Congress of the Socialist Youth Federation, which decided by a very large majority to withdraw its membership of the Socialist Party to join the new Communist Party, under the new name of the Italian Communist Youth Federation. ==References== Category:1921 establishments in Italy Category:Comintern sections Category:Communism in Italy

72739844	I Am the River, the River Is Me	I Am the River, the River Is Me is the fifth studio album by Australian musician Jen Cloher. The album was recorded between New Zealand and Melbourne, Australia and is Cloher's first to feature songs sung in both English and te reo Māori. I Am the River, the River Is Me was announced in November 2022 and released on 3 March 2023 via Milk! Records. The album will be supported by an Australian tour, commencing in Perth on 6 May 2023 before heading to Europe in June 2023 and concluding in New Zealand in July 2023. ==Reception== Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen of Sydney Morning Herald said "Sonically, the record leans into a folksy palette that brings to mind Cloher's earlier work" saying, I Am the River, the River Is Me reads like a love letter to many things: heritage, queerness, oneself. Cloher is one of Australia's finest songwriters, one who takes time between releases and produces music that is in equal parts contemplative and joyful. This is a special record that pays tribute to the past and the future, blending the personal and the political and showing that everything is interconnected". Deb Pelser of Back Seat Mafia said "This album is all encompassing – it spans the personal, the exploration of their Māori heritage and is also a commentary on our recent political situation, all delivered in a collection of astute songs that are superbly produced and lushly orchestrated." Pelser added "Despite the undeniable tension that must have pervaded the genesis of these songs, Cloher's confident delivery, backed by some fine musicians, results in an album that is upbeat, hopeful and simply beautiful. Whilst it documents Cloher's personal quest it has universal themes that will resonate widely". Bryget Chrisfield of Beat Magazine said "Many of I Am the River, the River Is Me's songs flow with a sense of curious self- discovery, while others challenge: like initiating difficult convos and welcoming discomfort as an opportunity for personal growth." ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart performance for I Am the River, the River Is Me Chart (2023) Peak position Australian Albums (ARIA) 30 ==Release history== Release history and formats for I Am the River, the River Is Me Region Date Format Label Catalogue Australia 3 March 2023 Milk!

7665994	I Am Blessed	"I Am Blessed" is a song by British girl group Eternal written by hit songwriter Mark Mueller and Marsha Malamet. It was the second single from the album Power of a Woman and peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart. The pop ballad spent a total of 12 weeks on the UK chart in 1995 and 1996, with three weeks in the top 10 and seven weeks in the top 20. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments over 200,000 copies in the UK. It also reached number seven in Ireland, becoming the group's second top-10 hit in that country. Eternal performed "I Am Blessed" for Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in 1995. ==Critical reception== James Masterton for Dotmusic described the song as one of the group's "softer, slushier records". Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote, "Another possible chart-buster from the creme of British R&B.; The religious undertones are very suitable for the Christmas season, just like the extra track Oh Happy Day, a wonderfully updated version of the gospel traditional with a jazzy rhythm guitar and a midtempo beat." A reviewer from Music Week rated it three out of five, adding that "this silky smooth ballad has hints of I Will Always Love You, with Easther living up to Houston's standards. A hit, but not a monster." ==Track listings== UK CD1 and Australian CD single # "I Am Blessed" # "Oh Happy Day" # "Stay" (1995 D.A.R.C.

7694517	I Am a Barbarian	I Am a Barbarian is a historical novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs written in 1941 but was not published until after the author's death, first appearing in hardback on September 1, 1967 as published by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. The book was originally to have been published by Canaveral Press. When Canaveral stopped adding titles to its catalog, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. took up the project. It was the first book the firm had published since Llana of Gathol, in 1948. I Am a Barbarian is one of only two historical novels Burroughs wrote. The other, The Outlaw of Torn, set in the England of King Henry III, was published in 1927. ==Plot introduction== The story is pitched as a free translation of the memoirs of Britannicus, serving for 25 years as the slave of Caligula, emperor of Rome from AD 37 to 41 who is historically known for being insane. It treats a number of different supposed facets of Caligula's life, including his popular early acts as emperor and his descent into madness. Britannicus watches as Caligula begins falsely accusing, fining and even killing individuals for the purpose of seizing their estates during a financial crisis caused by his own wasteful spending. A number of other desperate measures by Caligula are described in the book. In order to gain funds, Caligula asks the public to lend the state money. He levies taxes on lawsuits, marriage and prostitution, and begins auctioning the lives of the gladiators at shows. The novel also includes the famous story that once, at some games at which he was presiding, he ordered his guards to throw an entire section of the crowd into the arena during intermission to be eaten by animals, because there were no criminals to be prosecuted and he was bored. ==References== * ==External links== *Edgar Rice Burroughs Summary Project page for I Am a Barbarian Category:1941 American novels Category:1967 American novels Category:American historical novels Category:Novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs Category:Novels about slavery in ancient Rome Category:Novels set in the 1st century Category:Fictional depictions of Caligula in literature Category:Novels published posthumously

7822134	I (band)	I were a Norwegian black metal supergroup formed in 2006. The band features Immortal members Abbath and Armagedda, Gorgoroth bassist TC King, and Enslaved's Ice Dale. The band cites Bathory as one of their major influences. == History == The band's debut album, Between Two Worlds, was released on 3 November 2006 in the United Kingdom and 14 November 2006 in the United States through Nuclear Blast Records. Their first and only live show was at the Hole in the Sky festival in Bergen on 26 August 2006. Currently, there are no more scheduled live shows.Nuclear Blast In 2007, Abbath stated that he had started working on new songs for the next album, although no further comment has been made since. Given Abbath's formation of the band Abbath in 2015 following his departure from Immortal along with I bassist TC King, it is unlikely that a future I album will emerge. As part of prompting their new project, Abbath covered I's Warriors in October 2015. == Style == The band features Abbath's raw black metal vocals accompanied with a classic metal influenced sound. Blasts beats and some of the more "erratic" structural traits of black metal have also been excluded, this gives the band more of a classic metal sound but the black metal influences are still evident giving the band a unique sound. == Members == * Abbath Doom Occulta (Olve Eikemo) – vocals, guitar * Ice Dale (Arve Isdal) – guitar * TC King (King ov Hell, Tom Cato Visnes) – bass * Armagedda – drums == Discography == * Between Two Worlds (2006) == References == == External links == * Official website (archived) * Official band page at Nuclear Blast Category:Norwegian black metal musical groups Category:Norwegian heavy metal musical groups Category:Norwegian viking metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2006 Category:2006 establishments in Norway Category:Heavy metal supergroups Category:Musical quartets Category:Musical groups from Norway with local place of origin missing Category:Nuclear Blast artists

8099920	I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby	"I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby" is an American popular song and jazz standard by Jimmy McHugh (music) and Dorothy Fields (lyrics). The song was introduced by Adelaide Hall at Les Ambassadeurs Club in New York in January 1928 in Lew Leslie's Blackbird Revue, which opened on Broadway later that year as the highly successful Blackbirds of 1928 (518 performances), wherein it was performed by Adelaide Hall, Aida Ward, and Willard McLean. In the 100-most recorded songs from 1890 to 1954, "I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby" (1928) is No. 24. ==Background== Jimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields had written the score for a revue at Les Ambassadeurs Club on 57th Street, New York, which featured the vocalist Adelaide Hall. However, the producer Lew Leslie believed that they still missed a 'smash' tune. The team pondered for a while before finally playing Leslie "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby". This was the song Leslie had been looking for and he immediately included it in the revue. One advertisement called it "the song success of the Nation." Blackbird Revue opened on January 4, 1928, with Adelaide Hall singing "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby" solo. Later on, Fields and McHugh wrote a second half for the revue and Leslie expanded the production. With extra songs and extra performers added (including the vocalist Aida Ward), Leslie renamed the revue Blackbirds of 1928 and took the full production for a tryout in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where it appeared at Nixon's Apollo Theatre. On May 9, 1928, Blackbirds of 1928 opened at the Liberty Theatre, Broadway. The idea behind the song came during a stroll Fields and McHugh were taking one evening down Fifth Avenue; they saw a young couple window-shopping at Tiffany's. McHugh and Fields understood that the couple could not afford to buy jewelry from Tiffany's, but nevertheless they drew closer to them. It was then they heard the man say: "Gee, honey I'd like to get you a sparkler like that, but right now, i can't give you nothin' but love!" Hearing this, McHugh and Fields rushed to a nearby Steinway Tunnel, and within an hour they came up with "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby". Some controversy surrounds the song's authorship. Andy Razaf's biographer Harry Singer offers circumstantial evidence that suggests Fats Waller might have sold the melody to McHugh in 1926 and that the lyrics were by Andy Razaf."I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby" at Jazz Standards Alternatively, Philip Furia has pointed out that Fields' verse is almost identical to the end of the second verse of Lorenz Hart's and Richard Rodgers' song "Where's That Rainbow?" from Peggy-Ann, the 1926 musical comedy with book by Fields' brother Herbert and produced by their father Lew: ==Recorded versions== * Mildred Grizelle (released by Gennett Records in 1928 under the New Electrobeam (Black Label) catalog number 6646, with the flip side "Low Down" by Virginia Lee * Sam Lanin, with vocals provided by Irving Kaufman (May 1928) * Johnny Hamp's Kentucky Serenaders (vocal by H.

She also altered the lyrics to sing "Gee, I'd like to say you're looking swell, Tony", who later rejoins with the line "Diamond bracelets won't work, doesn't sell, Gaga". Jeff Benjamin from Fuse was positive in his review, saying that "[t]here's a walking bassline, gospel organs and brassy horn blasts to back the pair's soulful crooning. And while we love listening to Gaga and Tony, we really get into the throwback vibe when the trumpet solo kicks in. Trey Barrineau from USA Today complimented the duos vocals, saying that the song "really swings". Jesse David Fox from New York also gave a positive review, stating that "lot has been written about the creative and commercial shortcomings of Gaga's last record, [Artpop], but I, for one, am glad about its failure – because anything that frees her up to record more music with Tony Bennett is a win in my book. 'I Can't Give You Anything but Love' is a great example; Tony Bennett might be 88, but it's Gaga who hasn't sounded this alive in years." A writer for Next Magazine declared that Gaga sounded "absolutely stellar" in the song, and found it to be a "vocal vehicle" for the artist to "show off" her singing. Debra Kamin from The Times of Israel praised Gaga's vocals on "I Can't Give You Anything but Love", for her range and control. MTV News critic Gil Kaufman described the track as "funky". Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine gave a negative review, saying that "for a singer who isn't even 30, Gaga's voice is shockingly rough-hewn". ===Release and commercial performance=== "I Can't Give You Anything but Love" was released as the second single from Bennett's and Lady Gaga's first collaborative album Cheek to Cheek (2014) on August 19, 2014. Gaga announced the release on Twitter, accompanied by the single's cover art. On October 6, two remixes of the song were made available for digital download. Remix by Italian record producer Giorgio Moroder was released exclusively to Idolator website. The chords of the original version was changed, with Moroder adding synths and a bassline, complementing the vocals of Bennett and Gaga. Another remix, was an Earmilk exclusive and was made by Austrian musician Parov Stelar. He changed the cover into a "bouncy jazz house mix that provides a perfect compliment to the stars' seasoned vocals". Additionally, Universal Music Group sent the single to Italian radios on January 16, 2015. After its release, "I Can't Give You Anything but Love" debuted at number-one on the Jazz Digital Songs chart of Billboard, on the week ending September 6, 2014. The single also appeared on national charts of France and Italy at numbers 173 and 76 respectively. ===Music video=== An official music video for the song was released on August 26, 2014. The video was shot in the recording studio and the first half showed Gaga in numerous outfits and wigs, while recording the song and roaming around. Bennett joins the studio sessions later on, singing the song. The final chorus finds the two singers belting together, described as "join[ing] forces for a peculiar, yet potent blend of styles that transcends generations and genres". Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone complimented the video, saying that it "proves [Gaga and Bennett] exude a unique, adorable brand of musical chemistry". Maurice Bobb from MTV News noticed the "bare essence" of the duo in the video and added that Gaga appeared "overwhelmingly subdued", but felt that "her playful energy still shines through as she preens and shimmies to [Bennett's] smooth crooning." Nolan Feeney from Time that Gaga appeared normal in the video and added that "she's still fun to watch even when she's just hanging out in the vocal both (and dressed like a relatively normal human, no less)." Katie Atkinson from Billboard declared that "If you love the adorable friendship between glam pop queen Lady Gaga and classic crooner Tony Bennett, you'll definitely want to see the breezy behind-the-scenes studio video of the pair for 'I Can't Give You Anything but Love'." Idolator's Mike Wass described the video in detail, calling it the "perfect antidote for Gaga's overwhelming, more-is-more Artpop visuals... The swingin' standard is a nice fit for Gaga and Tony.

8115851	I Am Joaquin	I Am Joaquin (also known as Yo soy Joaquin), by Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales and translated by Juanita Dominguez, is a famous epic poem associated with the Chicano movement of the 1960s in the United States. In I am Joaquin, Joaquin (the narrative voice of the poem) speaks of the struggles that the Chicano people have faced in trying to achieve economic justice and equal rights in the U.S., as well as to find an identity of being part of a hybrid mestizo society. He promises that his culture will survive if all Chicano people stand proud and demand acceptance. The Chicano movement inspired much new poetry. I Am Joaquin is one of the earliest and most widely read works associated with the movement. In its entirety, the poem describes the then modern dilemma of Chicanos in the 1960s trying to assimilate with American culture while trying to keep some semblance of their culture intact for future generations, then proceeds to outline 2000 years of Mexican and Mexican-American history, highlighting the different, often opposing strains that make up the Chicano heritage. In the poem, for example, the speaker, Joaquin, traces both his ancestry to the Spanish conquistadores and the Aztecs they "conquered"; he also identifies with revolutionary figures of Mexican history such as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Benito Juárez, Pancho Villa and Joaquin Murrieta who was a legendary Californian known for seeking retribution against the Anglo- Americans invaders who killed his wife. The poem creates a "multivalent and heroic identity" in the figure of Joaquin, one that serves as a "collective cultural identity that contains within it a call to action." In 1969, the poem was adapted into a short film by director Luis Valdez, a leading figure in Chicano theater. ==References== ==External links== * I am Joaquin (poem) * Analysis Category:Epic poems in Spanish Category:Chicano Category:Mexican- American literature

9091626	I Am the Great Horse	I Am the Great Horse is a historical fantasy novel by English writer Katherine Roberts, published in August, 2006 by The Chicken House and aimed at teens. It is about the life of Alexander the Great, told from the point of view of his horse, Bucephalus. ==Plot summary== The pair meet in Pella, Macedonia, and Alexander manages to be the only rider on Bucephalus after a battle in which Bucephalas lost his left eye by an enemy pike. Katherine Roberts acknowledges that the characters Charmia and Tydeos, both grooms in the royal stable, are fictional, as is the evil horsemaster. The names of the other horses are also fictional, though the horses themselves were real enough. Prince Ochus, King Darius's son, was given a larger part than in most records, and the ghosts that Bucephalus often sees are also fictional. From the moment the battle- scarred horse Bucephalas allows a prince and a runaway girl to sit on his back, he is bound to them for ever. The prince is the young Alexander the Great, who he proudly carries into battle, blazing a trail to the very edge of the world in master's search for glory and adventure. The girl, Charm, is a lowly stable hand, who brushes away the ghosts Bucephalas sees and forgives his arrogant ways. But unlike Alexander, Charm has darker reasons to stay by his side. Through the eyes of the horse, history, mystery and adventure unfold. ==References== Category:2006 British novels Category:British fantasy novels Category:British young adult novels Category:Novels by Katherine Roberts Category:Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great Category:Children's historical novels Category:Children's novels about horses Category:2006 children's books Category:The Chicken House books Category:Historical fantasy novels
9116917	I Believe (Tears for Fears song)	"I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)" is a single by the British band Tears for Fears. It was the band's eleventh single release, and as a live re-recording of a song from their second LP Songs from the Big Chair, it effectively served as that album's fifth single. It was Tears for Fears' ninth UK Top 40 hit (peaking at #23). The song also reached the Top 10 in Ireland and peaked at #28 in New Zealand. The song was written by Roland Orzabal who had originally planned to offer it to British musician Robert Wyatt to record, although it was later decided that Tears for Fears would record the song themselves for their album Songs from the Big Chair. Additionally, a cover of Robert Wyatt's "Sea Song" served as the single's B-side. The album version of "I Believe" is dedicated to Wyatt in the liner notes. Roland Orzabal has confirmed the song is about Primal Therapy, particularly in the last line (which includes references to "a newborn scream" and "the shaping of a life"). It was the first Tears for Fears release on which the band itself is listed as producer. Although the single was not released in the United States, the re-recording of the song was done in the midst of the band's 1985 American tour. In the course of the song, Orzabal shouts "William!" prior to a saxophone solo. The shout was directed to Tears for Fears' touring saxophonist of the time, Will Gregory, best known today as the keyboardist, producer, and composer of the electronic music duo Goldfrapp. The music video for the song, featuring a shirtless Orzabal (as seen on the single's picture sleeve), was filmed in an aircraft hangar in Seattle, Washington. It was again directed by Nigel Dick. ==Track listings== ===7": Mercury / IDEA11 (UK)=== # "I Believe (A Soulful Re- Recording)" (4:35) # "Sea Song" (3:52) ===2x7": Mercury / IDEA1111 (UK)=== # "I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)" (4:35) # "Sea Song" (3:52) # "I Believe (Album Version)" (4:37) # "Shout (Dub Version)" (6:45) ===10": Mercury / IDEA1110 (UK)=== # "I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)" (4:35) # "I Believe (Album Version)" (4:37) # "Sea Song" (3:52) ===12": Mercury / IDEA1112 (UK)=== # "I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)" (4:35) # "Shout (Dub Version)" (6:45) # "Sea Song" (3:52) # "Shout (U.S. Remix)" (8:00) ==Credits and personnel== Tears for Fears *Roland Orzabal – lead vocals, grand piano *Curt Smith – backing vocals, triangle, bass guitar *Ian Stanley – keyboards *Manny Elias – drums Additional personnel *Will Gregory – saxophone (both studio & live recordings) *Andy Sanders – acoustic guitar (live) *Nicky Holland – piano (live) Sea Song *Roland Orzabal – lead vocals *Nicky Holland – piano *Ian Stanley – keyboards *David Bascombe – keyboards ==Notes== ==References== Category:Tears for Fears songs Category:1985 singles Category:Music videos directed by Nigel Dick Category:Songs written by Roland Orzabal Category:1985 songs Category:Phonogram Records singles Category:Mercury Records singles

9169723	I Can Get It for You Wholesale (film)	I Can Get It for You Wholesale is a 1951 American romantic drama film directed by Michael Gordon. The screenplay by Abraham Polonsky is based on Vera Caspary's loose adaptation of the 1937 novel of the same title by Jerome Weidman. ==Plot== Set in New York City's garment district, the story focuses on ambitious model and fashion designer Harriet Boyd, production manager Sam Cooper, and salesman Teddy Sherman, who leave their firm to start their own business that specializes in $10.95 dresses. Their plans temporarily are derailed when Harriet's mother refuses to give her the insurance payment the family received when her father died, having promised it to Harriet's younger sister Marge for her wedding. Harriet dupes Marge and her fiancé Ray into giving her the money, and Sherboyco Dresses opens for business. Teddy, who has fallen in love with Harriet, is dismayed when she flirts with lecherous buyer Mr. Savage during a business dinner, so he proposes marriage. She declines his offer, telling him she enjoys her freedom. Her refusal prompts Teddy to try to back out of their partnership, but he discovers their contract is ironclad. Harriet begins dating J. F. Noble, the owner of a chain of upscale department stores, who wants her to quit and work exclusively for him. Her uncertainty puts her on edge, and when Teddy discusses her change in attitude, she claims she is stressed by overwork and wants to quit. Teddy repeats his offer of marriage and this time Harriet considers accepting. She visits Noble to decline his offer, but Teddy interrupts their meeting, misunderstands her motives, and mistakenly believes her behavior was a ploy designed to lead the way to her departure from Sherboyco. Heartbroken and angry, Teddy departs, and soon after leaves town for a sales trip. During his absence, Harriet shifts money from Sherboyco to a new company she is founding, stops production on Sherboyco's dresses, and begins designing for Noble's department stores. Unaware what has happened, Teddy continues to take orders for Sherboyco's popular low-cost women's wear while on the road. Not until buyer Hermione Griggs contacts him about an order she has not received does he learn about Harriet's deception. She tries to convince her Sherboyco partners it is in their best interest to align with her at Noble's company, but Sam and Teddy prefer to declare bankruptcy rather than join forces with the competition. Harriet prepares to sail to Paris with Noble, but at the last moment she realizes her commitment to Sam and Teddy is too important to ignore. She returns to Sherboyco, where she admits she loves Teddy and asks him and Sam to forgive her. ==Production== The protagonist of Weidman's novel had been an ambitious businessman, but his gender was changed to accommodate Twentieth Century Fox contract player Susan Hayward. She and co-star Dan Dailey reprised their film roles for a Lux Radio Theatre broadcast on March 31, 1952.I Can Get It for You Wholesale at Turner Classic Movies Shortly after the film was released, screenwriter Abraham Polonsky was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Although he refused to deny or confirm affiliation with the Communist Party, he found himself blacklisted. He continued to write under pseudonyms, but it was not until Madigan in 1968 that he received screen credit under his own name. The film was released in the United Kingdom as This Is My Affair.Variety review When it was broadcast on American television in 1962, its title was changed to Only the Best to avoid confusion with the stage musical based on Weidman's novel that was running on Broadway at the time. ==Main cast== *Susan Hayward as Harriet Boyd * Dan Dailey as Teddy Sherman * George Sanders as J.F. Noble * Sam Jaffe as Sam Cooper * Randy Stuart as Marge Boyd * Marvin Kaplan as Arnold Fisher * Harry von Zell as Savage * Barbara Whiting as Ellen Cooper * Vicki Cummings as Hermione Griggs * Ross Elliott as Ray * Richard Lane as Kelley * Mary Philips as Mrs. Boyd ==Critical reception== Bosley Crowther of the New York Times observed, "In adapting Jerome Weidman's sizzling novel of 1937 to the screen, Vera Caspary has changed practically everything except the title of Mr. Weidman's book. An ambitious model now is the center of attraction, but she does not compare with Harry Bogen, the breezy, unscrupulous Bronxite who left a trail of broken promises in his sweep up Seventh Avenue in the novel. However, give Susan Hayward some quick recognition for bringing to life a hard-shelled dame, who travels just as fast and loose as the screenplay written by Abraham Polonsky permits her to. Within the story framework laid out by Miss Caspary, Mr. Polonsky has written some crisp, double-edged dialogue, but the flavor of the garment industry never is really exploited. This is regrettable because the chief distinction in the way of freshness the picture has to offer are the scenes which reflect the pulse beat of the dress industry — the crowds scurrying along Seventh Avenue amid the traffic of dress carts and the frenetic atmosphere of the showrooms where the buyers are not only baited with dresses but blandishments as well. The camera roves excitingly through this fabulous, hurly-burly in the pictures' opening sequences, but too soon Director Michael Gordon has to face the business of telling the story of a pert young-lady who is determined to climb to the top of the heap . . . With less whitewash and more honesty, I Can Get It for You Wholesale could have been an exciting, instead of just an average good, entertainment."New York Times review TV Guide rated it three out of four stars, calling it a "smooth but not stellar adaptation of Weidman's novel" and "about as accurate an image as one can get of the 'Rag Trade' circa 1951."TV Guide review ==References== == External links == * Category:1951 films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films directed by Michael Gordon Category:20th Century Fox films Category:1951 romantic drama films Category:American romantic drama films Category:Films produced by Sol C.

It is not known whether the film currently survives,Progressive Silent Film List: I Am the Law at silentera.com which suggests that it is a lost film. ==Plot== The plot, as described by the defendants in the 1922 court case regarding the attribution of the Curwood story: :Two brothers were members of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police at the little settlement of Paradise. One, Corporal Fitzgerald, was counted the best man tracker in the north and a credit to the Mounted; his younger and weak brother, Tom, private, had often been reprimanded for misconduct (by the commandant), and at the time the story opens he was carrying on a secret affair with the wife of the commanding officer at the post. The corporal had learned of it, and reproved his brother, but Tom defied him. A school-teacher, Joan Cameron, in traveling through the forest, had been caught in a storm, and had taken refuge at the notorious dance hall conducted by a half-breed Chinaman, who was pressing his advances upon her when the corporal arrived and killed him. After rescuing the teacher, the two encountered Tom, who made love to her and won her promise to marry him. The corporal, who had fallen in love with her, resigned in favor of his younger brother and wished them well. :The commanding officer at the post started on a journey, and Tom lost no time in going to his home and resuming his love affair with the false wife. Forgetting some papers, the officer returned home, to find Tom and his wife drinking together and caressing each other. He lashed Tom with a dog whip, and Tom got possession of his revolver and shot him dead. Tom took the dead man's dog team and escaped into the wilds. The call of duty forced the corporal to pursue his brother. They met in a blizzard on a mountain side, and after a struggle the corporal was thrown down the mountain side. Tom found refuge in the cabin of the school-teacher, where later the corporal found him and placed him under arrest. In reply to his brother's entreaty the corporal could only answer, "I Am the Law." :The storm grew worse, and the corporal's exposure brought on pneumonia. He felt he was dying, and could not bear the thought of his widowed mother losing him by illness, and her younger son upon the gallows. So he had paper and pen brought him, and he wrote and signed a confession to the murder. Then he dropped back upon the cot, apparently dead; but with Joan's nursing he recovered. Exonerated by the confession, Tom returned to the settlement, presented the confession, and reported his brother as dead. But a trapper had stopped at Joan's cabin, perhaps a couple of weeks after Tom left it. He found the corporal sitting up and well. Upon arriving at the post, the trapper reported this, and Tom was sent back to arrest and bring in his brother, which he did. :The corporal was thrown into jail at the post, and was to be taken to a larger town for trial. But a mob formed, the corporal was dragged from the jail, and about to be lynched. Joan rushed to the widow of the murdered man, and pleaded with her to tell the truth and save the corporal. After a struggle with the woman she succeeded, got her out to the mob, and her confession was believed. The mob released the corporal and started back to get Tom, who saw them coming and committed suicide. The corporal and Joan were married, and we leave them starting on a honeymoon trip with their dog sled. ==Cast== *Alice Lake as Joan Cameron *Kenneth Harlan as Cpl.

9329576	I Apologize (album)	I Apologize, while credited to Ginuwine, is not an official release but has acceptance to his catalog. It peaked at No. 50 on the Billboard Top R&B;/Hip- Hop Albums chart. According to the San Diego Union Tribune an article written by music critic George Varga, Music Manager Leon Derrick Youngblood SR was quoted as saying, "the album was to be a Ginuwine Presents Album, it did very well on such a low budget the album reached number 50 on the billboard charts". Youngblood and his wife Ginger both managed the recording artist, who hit number 50 on the charts. The album 'I Apologize' was released in Feb 13, 2007. ==Background== By the time I Apologize hit the shelves in 2007, Ginuwine had been working the R&B; loverman vibe for over ten years. The artist's 2000s albums don't have the cutting edge that his mid-'90s work with Timbaland possessed, but they continue to impress, offering up a silky-smooth brew of contemporary production, pulsing beats, and the artist's knee-weakening croon. The title track, one of the album's highlights, gets things rolling with its moderate, bouncing groove, one of a handful of satisfying, head-nodding tracks. But Ginuwine is at his best on ballads like "Better Days," a song that not only showcases his vocal dexterity, but swells with an inspirational fervor that tips its hat to gospel. Ginuwine's mix of old-school R&B; with a hip-hop flavored sensibility has always appealed; I Apologize is another fine example of its charm. == Sales== After its release on February 13, 2007, the album I Apologize was distributed to the stores for sale but soon after that there was a dispute regarding the copyright of the eight track (AllMusic). Apparently the CD had only three songs attributed to Ginuwine and the rest were by other undisclosed artists. It was therefore not an official release and official sales have not been concluded as this was an unauthorized album (AllMusic). == Track listing == # "Intro" – 1:06 # "I Apologize" (Melvin "Melrog" Rogers, Ted Clinkscale, Elgin Lumpkin) – 4:20 # "Since I Found U" (featuring Tommy Redding) (P.

9387595	I Am Josh Polonski's Brother	I Am Josh Polonski's Brother is Raphael Nadjari's second feature film. It was shot in New York City in 1999 and early 2000, in Super 8mm 200 ASA. The film premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in the Forum. ==Plot== The Polonski brothers, Abe, Ben and Josh, work together in their family's fabric store on the lower east side of Manhattan. Like any other Jewish family they go to their mother's to spend the Sabbath together. But one day, Josh is shot to death in the middle of the street in front of Abe's eyes.. For Ben the tragic situation has an explanation - the nightlife of Josh - but Abe wants to understand what happened. Following the path of his brother, he walks in the same footsteps, finding more and more of himself. ==Production and release== Shot in two period, one of 15 days during December 1999 and a few days of retakes in April 2000, in Super-8 format and improvised with no script, I Am Josh Polonski's Brother was shot mainly in Orchard Street in New York City, it includes rare footage of Rivington Street's First Roumanian-American congregation. The film premiered at the Forum of Young Cinema in the Berlin Film Festival. The film was then released in France by distributor MK2 and more than 50,000 people came to see it in theaters even though it was shot in Super 8mm. Kodak supported the film to prove that it was possible to create a narrative feature in Super-8 format in the midst of the digital age. Nadjari not only proved it but demonstrated that the digital age, instead of reducing media to its own format, is in fact a great system of expanding the possibilities of most film and video formats. Nadjari's idea is that the digital age is an archiving system that enables any other format to fit, not technically, but more to integrate with the story we want to tell. It is thus possible to use almost any recording device and have it fit to a narrative integration. Here the film was about family and nostalgia for film of the 70's, Super-8 film was the best format to fuse the format with its content. ==Awards and nominations== * Berlin Film Festival (2001) - Forum of Young Cinema == References == == External links == * *Variety *Interview Richard Edson and Raphael Nadjari *Trailer Category:2000 films Category:English- language French films Category:American independent films Category:Films about Jews and Judaism Category:Films directed by Raphael Nadjari Category:French independent films Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s American films Category:2000s French films
9390980	I Can Still Make Cheyenne	"I Can Still Make Cheyenne" is a song written by Aaron Barker and Erv Woolsey, and recorded by American country music artist George Strait. It was released in August 1996 as the third single from Strait's album Blue Clear Sky. The song also appears on 50 Number Ones. A live version can be heard on his album, For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome, which came out in 2003. A DVD, with the same name, also features the song. ==Content== The song is about the life of a rodeo cowboy. The song begins with the verse, "Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine. She heard his voice on the other end of the line. She wondered what was wrong this time. She never knew what his calls might bring, with a cowboy like him it could be anything, and she always expected the worst in the back of her mind." A phone call from a cowboy on the road to his love. He regrets his long absence and lack of writing or calling but assures her that he is coming home. However, her tone alerts him that something is wrong. The chorus reveals that the woman has decided to leave him for someone she says is "sure not a rodeo man". The cowboy replies that as much as this pains him, he will go on to Cheyenne, referring to the most prestigious rodeo around. He was going to give up Cheyenne to be with her, one of the biggest sacrifices a cowboy could make until she said she was leaving him for another. The song describes the cowboy ending the call and leaving the phone off the hook and slowly turning around and taking one last look. He then gets in his truck and "aims it toward that Wyoming line." The lyrics leave the listener to decide if the Cowboy was neglectful of his love, or if she gave up on him for another, who was not a rodeo man. The last verse of the song repeats the first. The soulful fiddle solo at the end of the song is one of the signatures of the song. ==Chart positions== "I Can Still Make Cheyenne" debuted at number 74 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of August 24, 1996.

9524601	I Can't Stand the Rain (song)	"I Can't Stand the Rain" is a song originally recorded by Ann Peebles in 1973, and written by Peebles, Don Bryant, and Bernard "Bernie" Miller. Other hit versions were later recorded by Eruption, Tina Turner and Lowell George. The original version is ranked at 197 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. ==Ann Peebles version== The song was written by Peebles, her partner (and later husband) Don Bryant, and DJ Bernard "Bernie" Miller in 1973: > One evening in Memphis in 1973, soul singer Ann Peebles was meeting friends, > including her partner, Hi Records staff writer Don Bryant, to go to a > concert. Just as they were about to set off, the heavens opened and Peebles > snapped: "I can't stand the rain." As a professional songwriter in constant > need of new material, Bryant was used to plucking resonant phrases out of > the air and he liked the idea of reacting against recent R&B; hits that > celebrated bad weather, such as the Dramatics' "In the Rain" and Love > Unlimited's "Walkin' in the Rain with the One I Love". So he sat down at the > piano and started riffing on the theme, weaving in ideas from Peebles and > local DJ Bernie Miller. The song was finished that night and presented the > next morning to Hi's studio maestro, Willie Mitchell, who used a brand new > gadget, the electric timbale, to create the song's distinctive raindrop > riff. It really was that easy. "We didn't go to the concert," Bryant > remembers. "We forgot about the concert."Dorian Lynskey, "Ann Peebles: the > girl with the big voice", The Guardian, 20 February 2014. Retrieved 30 June > 2014 Ann Peebles said: "At first, we had the timbales all the way through the song but as we played the tape, Willie Mitchell said 'what about if the timbales were in front before anything else comes in?'. So we did that and when we listened back I said 'I love it, let's do that'." Miss FunkyFlyy, "Ann Peebles". Retrieved June 30, 2014 The organ is played by Charles Hodges, who later said: "We wanted to catch a sound like water dripping. Willie pulled the timbales out and Howard [Grimes] did the low part and Teenie [Hodges] did the high part. It was an overdub."Graeme Thomson, "The Making of 'I Can't Stand the Rain'", Uncut, No.290, July 2021, pp.82-84 Peebles said: "I have to give Teenie a lot of credit, because he added a lot of licks and details to make it right." Produced by Willie Mitchell, the song became Peebles' biggest hit when, in 1973, it reached No. 38 on the US Pop Chart and No. 6 on the R&B;/Black Chart; it also reached No. 41 on the UK singles chart in April 1974. It was one of John Lennon's favorite songs; he called it "the best song ever". Ian Dury made the song one of his choices when he was the guest for BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in December 1996. Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott samples Ann Peebles version of the song on her debut solo single "The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)". ===Personnel=== * Ann Peebles - vocals * Howard Grimes - drums, percussion * Charles Hodges - organ * Leroy Hodges - bass * Mabon "Teenie" Hodges - guitar, percussion * Archie Turner - piano * James Mitchell - saxophone * Andrew Love - saxophone * Ed Logan - saxophone * Wayne Jackson - trumpet * Willie Mitchell - producer ===Charts=== Chart (1973/74) Peak position Australia (Kent Music Report) 79 U.S. (Billboard Hot 100) 38 ==Eruption version== In 1978, Eruption released a disco-oriented remake which became the group's biggest hit.

9528916	I Care 4 U (song)	"I Care 4 U" is a song recorded by American singer Aaliyah. Written by Missy Elliott and Timbaland, the song was originally recorded for Aaliyah's second studio album One in a Million (1996), but the recording was shelved. It was re-recorded in 2000 for Aaliyah (2001). A neo soul ballad, "I Care 4 U" features beatboxing, an electric piano and multi-tracked vocals. Following Aaliyah's death on August 25, 2001, "I Care 4 U" received heavy airplay in the United States despite not having been released as a single. It peaked at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was then included on Aaliyah's posthumous compilation album I Care 4 U (2002) and was released as its third single on April 8, 2003. == Writing and recording == "I Care 4 U" was written by Missy Elliott and Timbaland, and was produced by the latter. Aaliyah originally recorded the song for her second studio album One in a Million (1996), but it was completed after the album had finished post-production, and she chose to save it for her next album. In 2000, the song was re-recorded for Aaliyah at Magic Mix Studios and Music Grinder Studios in Los Angeles. ==Music and lyrics== Musically, "I Care 4 U" is a neo soul ballad which has been compared to the work of singer Angie Stone. The song includes an initially- uncredited sample of "(Too Little in Common to Be Lovers) Too Much Going to Say Goodbye" by The Newcomers. It features beatboxing, an electric piano and multi-tracked vocals. Michael Odell from The Guardian called the song "the sort of 1970s style ballad that Aaliyah's aunt, Gladys Knight, would approve of - but again it's stripped down and rebuilt with layers of haunting keyboard and lo-tech vocal percussion". According to Bob Waliszewski from Plugged In, the song "offers support to a guy stinging from a breakup". Graham Smith from musicOMH described "I Care 4 U" as a soft, romantic R&B; ballad. According to Aaliyah, the song speaks about a female narrator who tells her male friend: "Don't cry, I'll wipe your tears. I love you, just give me the chance to show you." ==Release== Despite receiving heavy airplay in 2002, "I Care 4 U" was never officially serviced to radio stations in the United States. However, it was released as a double A-side single with "Don't Worry" on April 8, 2003, as the second US single from I Care 4 U, by Blackground Records and Universal Records. In August 2021, it was reported that Aaliyah's recorded work for Blackground (since rebranded as Blackground Records 2.0) would be re-released on physical, digital, and, for the first time ever, streaming services in a deal between the label and Empire Distribution. Aaliyah, including "I Care 4 U", was re-released on September 10. ==Critical reception== Ross Scarano from Complex praised the production of "I Care 4 U", comparing it to the work of Angie Stone. He stated: "If it weren't from some low-in-the-mix beatboxing and complicated drum programming, "I Care 4 U" wouldn't register as a Timbaland production. The electric piano and extremely earnest multi-tracked vocals give off the sheen of neo-soul; this is Aaliyah doing Angie Stone". Luke McManus from the Irish publication RTÉ felt that Aaliyah showcased her voice more on the song and that her newfound vocal ability matched the "brilliance of the backing tracks". Daryl Easlea from BBC praised Aaliyah's vocal performance, saying the song "would be a conventional ballad on a more obvious soul star's album. It's what Aaliyah doesn't do that make it still sound stunning – it would have been so easy to over-ladle the emoting here". Michael Odell from The Guardian praised the song and compared it to the work of Gladys Knight. Russell Baillie from The New Zealand Herald described the song as "soul-sass" and felt that "Aaliyah's voice weaves through the sparse but punchy arrangements with a mix of sultriness". Billboard, felt that "I Care 4 U" was different from other songs that had released, yet Aaliyah "demonstrates the ease with which she can slip into a neo-soul ballad – with just enough production eccentricities to establish that Timb is indeed behind the boards". == Commercial performance == In the United States, "I Care 4 U" debuted at number 75 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs due to heavy airplay on June 1, 2002, despite not having been released as a single yet. It peaked at number three on the chart dated September 28, spending a total of 44 weeks charting. On the Billboard Hot 100, the song peaked at number 16 on October 26; it spent a total of 20 weeks on the chart. "I Care 4 U" also charted for 20 weeks on the Radio Songs chart, peaking at number 15. Along with "Rock the Boat" and "More Than a Woman", the song helped give Aaliyah a strong presence on the radio following her August 25, 2001 death. == Track listing == US 12-inch vinyl # "I Care 4 U" (album version) - 4:34 # "Don't Worry" - 3:55 == Credits and personnel == Credits are adapted from the liner notes of Aaliyah. * Aaliyah – vocals * Homer Banks – writing * Jimmy Douglass – engineering, mixing * Missy Elliott – writing * Bernie Grundman – mastering * Carl Hampton – writing * Timbaland – production, writing ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2002) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2002) Position US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) 24 Chart (2003) Position US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) 76 ==Release history== Release dates and formats for "I Care 4 U" Region Date Format(s) Label(s) United States April 8, 2003 12-inch vinyl ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== * Official website Category:2001 songs Category:2002 songs Category:2003 singles Category:Aaliyah songs Category:Contemporary R&B; ballads Category:Soul ballads Category:Song recordings produced by Timbaland Category:Songs written by Missy Elliott Category:Songs written by Timbaland Category:2000s ballads Category:Neo soul songs

9678569	I Can't Make You Love Me	"I Can't Make You Love Me" is a song written by Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin and recorded by American singer Bonnie Raitt for her eleventh studio album, Luck of the Draw (1991). Released as the album's second single in 1991, "I Can't Make You Love Me" became one of Raitt's most successful singles, reaching the top-20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the top-10 on the Adult Contemporary chart. In August 2000, Mojo magazine voted "I Can't Make You Love Me" the eighth best track on its The 100 Greatest Songs of All Time list. The song is ranked at number 339 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. On November 27, 2016, the Grammy Hall of Fame announced its induction, along with that of another 24 songs. ==Writing and recording== "I Can't Make You Love Me" was written by Nashville writers Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin, who were well-noted for their successes in the country music arena. The song was rewritten many times before being finalized, months later. "We wrote, most every week, in Mike's basement," Shamblin told Peter Cooper in an interview with the Nashville Tennessean. "And we'd worked on this song for more than six months. One day, he said, 'Come up to the living room,' where his piano was. He sat down and started playing this melody, and it was one of the most moving pieces of music I'd heard. I mean, it hit me in a hard way ... Instantly, I knew it was the best thing I'd ever been a part of." Reid and Shamblin were both country music songwriters, who according to some accounts originally wrote the song as a fast, bluegrass number. Upon slowing down the tempo considerably, they realized the song gained considerable power and thought about giving the song to one of three artists: Bonnie Raitt, Bette Midler or Linda Ronstadt. Eventually, the song made its way to Bonnie Raitt, who recorded the track for her eleventh studio album, Luck of the Draw (1991). Raitt co-produced the song with Don Was, while Bruce Hornsby provided a piano accompaniment. ==Composition and inspiration== The idea for the song came to Reid while reading an article about a man arrested for getting drunk and shooting at his girlfriend's car. The judge asked him if he had learned anything, to which he replied, "I learned, Your Honor, that you can't make a woman love you if she don't."1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them, Toby Creswell Raitt recorded the vocal in just one take in the studio, later saying that it was so sad a song that she could not recapture the emotion: "We'd try to do it again and I just said, 'You know, this ain't going to happen.'"107.1 KGSR - Radio Austin A pensive ballad, "I Can't Make You Love Me" was recorded against a quiet electric piano-based arrangement, with prominent piano fills and interpolations supplied by Bruce Hornsby. ==Critical reception and accolades== "I Can't Make You Love Me" received acclaim from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the track, calling it a "strong song" and picking it as one of the album's best tracks. Steve Hochman of Los Angeles Times hailed the song as one of Raitt's most elegant tracks. Elysa Gardner wrote for Rolling Stone that "Raitt's gorgeously understated rendering of 'I Can't Make You Love Me,' in which sentiments such as 'I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power/But you won't' are delivered with a quiet resignation that's worth a hundred glissandi in emotional weight." "I Can't Make You Love Me" entered many lists of the greatest songs of all time. In 2000, Mojo magazine placed it at number 8 on its "100 Greatest Songs of All Time" list. The song is also ranked No. 339 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The website "Ultimate Classic Rock" placed the song at number 24 on their "25 Saddest Songs Ever", praising Bonnie Raitt vocals, writing that "she sings in one of her most impassioned vocals ever. There's real ache in every word that drips from her pained lips." The song's popularity helped solidify her remarkable late-in-career commercial success that had begun two years before. In the time since, "I Can't Make You Love Me" has gone on to become a pop standard and a mainstay of adult contemporary radio formats. For Raitt, the song was notoriously difficult to sing, due to its required vocal range, difficult phrasing and breathing, and the emotional content involved. At the televised Grammy Awards of 1992 Raitt performed it in an even more austere setting than on record, with just her and Hornsby highlighted. As she negotiated the final vocal line, she let out a big audible and visible sigh of relief that she had successfully gotten through it. Her live performance of the song was released on the 1994 album Grammy's Greatest Moments Volume III. Raitt has continued to sing the song in all her concert tours: ==Music video== The video for this song uses the shorter single version of the song. Filmed in color, but transferred to video for black-and- white, with vibrant lighting effects, it features Raitt performing the song in front of a curtain with a silhouette of a pianist in the background (played by Bruce Hornsby, who actually plays piano on the record), while in other scenes, a scorching fire is taking place outdoors and many shadows of trees, branches, and even people at times are seen swaying to the song's rhythm. The music video was directed, photographed and edited by acclaimed director/photographer/illustrator Matt Mahurin, who has directed videos for artists including U2, Peter Gabriel, REM and Sting. ==Chart performance== The song was a big hit for Raitt, reaching number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 6 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. The song placed at number 100 on the Billboard Year-End chart of 1992. In New Zealand, the song was Raitt's highest charting-single, reaching number 22, while in Netherlands, the song charted moderately at number 43. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1991–1992) Peak position Australia (ARIA) 77 Canada RPM Adult ContemporaryRPM Adult Contemporary, December 14, 1991 4 Canada RPM Top Singles 40 UK Singles Chart 50 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1992) Position US Billboard Hot 100 100 US Adult Contemporary (Billboard) 17 ==Bruce Hornsby performance use== Although Bruce Hornsby had no hand in writing the song, his piano part on it became associated with him. Phil Collins described it as instantly recognizable as Hornsby's work. Hornsby's own publicity material mentions his role on the "classic". ==George Michael version== English singer George Michael covered "I Can't Make You Love Me" and released it on 20 January 1997 as a double A-side with "Older", serving as the fourth single from Michael's third studio album, Older. Michael's version was also included on his compilation Ladies & Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael (1998). "Older" / "I Can't Make You Love Me" reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. ===Background and release=== After the release of his second studio album, Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 (1990), George Michael started a legal battle with his label, Sony Music, declaring his contract was financially inequitable and creatively stifling. Michael sued Sony to end his contract, leading to a long and costly legal battle that ended in 1995, with Michael signing to the newly launched Dreamworks Records label in the United States and Virgin in the rest of the world. In 1995, the singer released the song "Jesus to a Child", which became a huge hit worldwide, followed by "Fastlove" and "Spinning the Wheel", which also became successful songs from his third studio album, Older (1996). While choosing the fourth single from the album, the title track "Older" was announced as the chosen one, with an EP also titled "Older" being released to promote the song. The EP features four tracks, including "Older", "The Strangest Thing" (also from the album "Older") and two covers: the famous Brazilian song "Desafinado" and Bonnie Raitt's "I Can't Make You Love Me", which became the official B-side of the single. Since it was released as a B-side to "Older", "I Can't Make You Love Me" also entered the UK Singles Chart ===Charts=== Chart (1997) Peak position ===Certifications=== == Boyz II Men version == American R&B; vocal group Boyz II Men recorded "I Can't Make You Love Me" for their third cover album, Love (2009). Their version was released as the album's first single on October 27, 2009. Having a more R&B; approach, "I Can't Make You Love Me" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, while it has achieved minor success on the Billboard's Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. ===Background and release=== After releasing their second cover album in 2007, Motown: A Journey Through Hitsville USA, which was well received by critics, but failed to produce a successful single, the band announced plans for a new cover album, that features cover versions of songs by "artists I don't think people would expect us to cover," according to member Shawn Stockman. On October 23, 2009, "I Can't Make You Love Me" was announced as Love's lead-single. The song was later released on October 27, 2009 through iTunes store. For the band members, "We wanted to stay true to our roots, and it's a very beautiful song. And with our sound, we gave it an R&B; twist. It's always been a favorite of ours, and we hope people will fall in love with it again." ===Reception=== A writer for Soul Bounce wrote that "The biggest surprise on this album is the bluesy interpretation of Bonnie Rait's country hit, 'I Can't Make You Love Me.' Starting with strong lyrics and a deep fried instrumental, the Boyz make this song their own with their unique flow providing good contrast to a familiar melodic line." Los Angeles Theatre called it an "impassioned" performance. On the charts, the song performed very modestly, reaching number 75 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. ===Chart performance=== Chart (2009) Peak position US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs 75 ==Bon Iver version== On June 14, 2011, a version of the song by Justin Vernon as Bon Iver was released as the B-side to the single "Calgary". ==Adele version== In 2011, English singer Adele covered "I Can't Make You Love Me" for her first live album, Live at the Royal Albert Hall (2011). The song was acclaimed by music critics, who praised Adele's delivery and vocals. The song has charted on the UK Singles Chart, reaching the top-forty, although it was never released as a single. ===Background and live performances=== In addition to receiving positive reviews from music critics, Adele's second album 21 became one of the most successful albums of the 2010s, being the biggest selling musical release for both 2011 and 2012 and entering the Guinness World Records. While promoting the album and its third single, "Set Fire to the Rain", Adele performed on the iTunes Festival London 2011. On the setlist, Adele performed tracks from 21 and a cover of "I Can't Make You Love Me". Before performing the track, Adele stated that it was one of her favorite songs and described it as "perfect in every way". She added that Bonnie Raitt has a "stunning voice" and went on to compliment the lyrics, calling them "mind-blowing". After the positive response of the iTunes Festival performance, Adele covered once again the track, during her first live album, Live at the Royal Albert Hall, recorded on 22 September 2011. She made further comment over the song, saying, "It blows me away" and further adding that she thought the song was "incredibly moving". Adele also commented on the emotions the song gives her, saying, "It makes me really, really happy and really, really devastated and depressed at the same time. It makes me think of my fondest and best times in my life, and it makes me think of the worst as well, and combined, probably is a recipe for disaster, but I do love this song. It's just fucking stunning." ===Critical reception=== While reviewing her iTunes Festival performance, David Smyth of London Evening Standard wrote that Adele sang the song "with raw expressiveness." Andrew Leahey of Allmusic wrote that the cover "made all the more tender by the rarely heard frailties in Adele's voice." Donald Gibson of Seattle Pi wrote that "she breathes new life into Bonnie Raitt's 'I Can't Make You Love Me,' with similar intimacy and conviction." While reviewing her Live at the Royal Albert Hall DVD, critics lauded Adele's rendition. Andy Gill of The Independent called it an "impassioned version," while Alex Young of Consequence of Sound named it "heartfelt and stunning." Kit O'Toole of Blogcritics praised her rendition, writing that it "retains its heart- wrenching, devastating mood thanks to Adele's multi-layered voice. Hearing her perform this song, one would imagine her as an older woman who has survived lifelong heartaches instead of a 23-year-old." Maria Schurr of PopMatters lauded the covers (Raitt's "I Can't Make You Love Me" and Bob Dylan's "Make You Feel My Love") on the live album, naming "the most successful," writing that "both seem deeply heartfelt, like Adele understands, and is the only one who can make these words that are not hers ring true." Chris Willman of The Wrap called it "a classic of unrequited love that you'd have to swear she wrote if Bonnie Raitt hadn't turned it into the ultimate female weepie back when Adele was 2." ===Chart performance=== Despite not being released as a single, "I Can't Make You Love Me" debuted at number 53 on the UK Singles Chart week of 30 September 2012. It later peaked at number 37, on the following week, 6 October 2012, becoming her eighth top-forty song and first non-single top-forty hit.

Speaking about the song, Chopra said "This is one of my favorite tracks on the album. It's my ode to a classic, a song that I love, and one that says so much – this is for the actor in me." Chopra's version of the song incorporates electronic dance music (EDM) and electropop in its production,. which comes courtesy of German producer Manuel "DJ Manian" Reuter. Andy Gensler from Billboard commented on how different Chopra's version was from the original by Raitt, saying that "Chopra's more uptempo take on the song is more likely to connect with a generation of ravers with no idea of the song's origin" The up- tempo version was demoed by American singer Ester Dean at the request of Interscope Records chairman Jimmy Iovine. It was released on 22 April 2014, by DesiHits, in association with 2101 Records and Interscope Records. It is the third internationally released single following "In My City" (featuring will.i.am), which failed to achieve airplay in the United States, and "Exotic". In the United Kingdom, "I Can't Make You Love Me" was originally planned to be Chopra's debut single. ===Promotion and music video=== Chopra's version of "I Can't Make You Love Me" was used to promote Beats by Dre. In a press release, it was revealed that the song would be used in the launch of a new campaign for the popular Beats Pill XL portable Bluetooth speaker. Chopra and her new track would be featured in the national ad campaign, that ran nationwide from May 1 through May 25. An accompanying music video was filmed in Los Angeles in February 2014. It was conceptualised and directed by duo Jeff Nicholas and Jonathan Craven of The Uprising Creative. Actor Milo Ventimiglia plays Chopra's love interest and scenes include Chopra throwing coloured paint at Ventimiglia as part of celebrations for the Indian festival of Holi, as well as embraces between the couple and solo scenes with Chopra. According to NDTV, the video charts a fictional relationship that "goes from loving to hellish". Behind the scenes footage was released to Access Hollywood. It premiered in New York City on 30 April 2014. Gensler noted that the video also contained product placement for Nokia and Beats by Dre speakers. ===Critical reception=== News18 said, "The singer certainly sounds great, so much that it's almost unbelievable it is Priyanka Chopra. The number is definitely foot-tapping and you're going to be hearing this one at every restaurant and club in the days to come" and added that Chopra had "definitely done a great job recreating the Bonnie Raitt song". ===Chart performance=== Chart (2014) US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) 28 ==Notes== Category:1991 songs Category:1991 singles Category:1990s ballads Category:1997 singles Category:2009 singles Category:2014 singles Category:Bonnie Raitt songs Category:George Michael songs Category:Boyz II Men songs Category:Adele songs Category:Priyanka Chopra songs Category:Mike Reid (singer) songs Category:Nancy Wilson (jazz singer) songs Category:Black-and-white music videos Category:2101 Records singles Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Decca Records singles Category:Interscope Records singles Category:Pop ballads Category:Song recordings produced by Don Was Category:Songs written by Mike Reid (singer) Category:Songs written by Allen Shamblin Category:Song recordings produced by George Michael Category:Torch songs Category:Universal Music Group singles Category:Virgin Records singles

9960975	I Can't Break Down	"I Can't Break Down" is a song written by Sinéad Quinn, Pete Glenister, and Deni Lew for Quinn's debut album, Ready to Run (2003). Produced by Glenister and Lew, it was released as her debut single from the album in February 2003 and reached a peak position of number two in the UK Singles Chart and finished in 65th place for the best-selling UK singles of 2003. ==Background and writing== Quinn finished as the runner-up in the first series of Fame Academy behind David Sneddon. She signed a record deal with Mercury Records a week after the final and revealed that she would release her debut single on 10 February 2003. Sneddon had a number one single with "Stop Living the Lie in January 2003. The song was written by Quinn during her time on Fame Academy. Fame Academy differed from the similar Pop Idol in that the contestants were able to develop their all-round musical talents and write original material during their time on the show. In an interview with the BBC she revealed how her experience on Fame Academy had changed her music style for this song. She said "Before I went in, I wouldn't have been into commercial stuff...my tunes might not have been so radio-friendly, but I'm working on it. I wouldn't have got that much of a hook into my songs. I think the hook is very important." ==Critical reception== The song received mixed reviews from music critics. Michael Hubbard (writing for musicOMH) described Quinn's voice as "rich" in comparison to her vocal performance on Fame Academy but commented "if Sinéad wants a career that is more than a flash in the pan, she's going to have to get a lot more dangerous than this". He did, however, commend her for avoiding being like a "karaoke star-turn of the genre's lesser programmes." ==Track listings== UK CD single # "I Can't Break Down # "Don't Speak" # "I Try" (acoustic) UK cassette single # "I Can't Break Down" # "I Try" (acoustic) ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2003) Peak position Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 10 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2003) Position UK Singles (OCC) 65 ==References== Category:2003 singles Category:Mercury Records singles Category:Number-one singles in Scotland Category:Songs written by Pete Glenister Category:Songs written by Deni Lew
9963622	I Come in Peace	I Come in Peace (released under the alternative title Dark Angel) is a 1990 American science fiction action film directed by Craig R. Baxley, and starring Dolph Lundgren, Brian Benben, Betsy Brantley and Matthias Hues. The film was released in the United States on September 28, 1990. The film is about a rule- breaking vice cop who becomes involved in the investigation of mysterious drug-related murders on the streets of Houston, Texas. The original title is Dark Angel; the film was planned to be released under the same title in the United States (which had the latest release) but was renamed by Triumph Releasing to I Come in Peace because of two other movies entitled The Dark Angel (from 1925 and 1935), according to executive producer Mark Damon (in a 1993 interview with UK magazine Impact), who preferred the original title. == Plot == Houston police officer Jack Caine will not let police procedure prevent him from pursuing his mission to wipe out the White Boys, a gang of white collar drug dealers who killed his partner while Caine was stopping a convenience store robbery. The White Boys disguise their narcotics trafficking behind the visage of expensive luxury sports cars, executive level jobs, and flashy designer suits. Led by the vicious but urbane Victor Manning, the White Boys operate above accusation but not suspicion. When the White Boys steal a shipment of heroin from a federal evidence warehouse, they hide evidence of their involvement by blowing up the facility, killing or injuring numerous people. This brings in the FBI, and Caine is partnered with a by-the-book agent, Arwood "Larry" Smith. They investigate the drug theft and the later murder of several key White Boys soldiers by a hyper fast spinning disk. At the same time, Caine is made aware - via his girlfriend, coroner Diane Pallone - of a series of strange drug-related deaths. The corpses are full of heroin, but the cause of death is a puncture wound to the forehead. Unknown to Caine and the police, the deaths are caused by Talec, an alien who is extracting something from the victims. He is being pursued by Azeck, a similar alien to himself. Azeck soon tracks Talec to a supermarket where a battle ensues. After being severely injured in the fight, Azeck is able to sneak into Caine's car as he and Smith investigate the bloody scene left at the super market. After Caine and Smith are ordered off the investigation by their superiors, they discover the mortally wounded Azeck in the back seat. Azeck explains that he is a police officer from his own home planet, and that Talec shoots his victims full of synthetic heroin and then uses alien technology to extract the resulting endorphins from their brains, synthesizing them into a drug called "Barsi" to be used by addicts on his home planet. He warns Caine and Smith that if Talec is not stopped, thousands of intergalactic drug dealers will come to Earth to slaughter its population, since Earth is seen as a cheap source of Barsi, which is extremely rare in the rest of the galaxy. Azeck dies and his body cremates itself - but Smith has retained Azeck's powerful hand- gun and intends to pass it onto his FBI superior to prove that the aliens exist. Caine warns that Switzer should not be trusted and wants to give the gun to his own supervisor, Chief Malone. The two disagree and separate. Smith gives the weapon to Inspector Switzer, who reveals that the FBI already know about the aliens, and they intend on opening dialogue with Talec in order to gain technological and weapon advantages. He then attempts to shoot Smith, but Caine saves him at the last moment. Thanks to information from Azeck, they track Talec down to an industrial complex but are waylaid by the White Boys who believe Caine to be behind the deaths of their soldiers. Talec arrives in the middle of the standoff and kills the remaining White Boys before being forced to retreat after Smith uses Azeck's weapon against him. At the complex, Azeck's weapon runs out of charge and Talec attempts to kill Caine using his drug harpoon. While fending off the harpoon Caine grabs a vial of the synthesized Barsi drug and the two engage in hand-to-hand combat over the vial, resulting in Talec being impaled on a steel spike. Cain retrieves Talec's gun - a similar weapon to Azeck's - and shoots nearby drums of fuel, killing Talec in the resulting explosion. With Talec dead, Caine and Smith realize that they have completed Azeck's mission: Talec will not return to his home world, and since no other drug dealers from his home planet know about Earth, there will be no invasion. As they leave the complex, Caine suggests paying Manning a visit... == Cast == * Dolph Lundgren as Detective Jack Caine, a Houston police detective investigating a string of drug-related murders. * Brian Benben as Special Agent Arwood "Larry" Smith, an FBI agent and Caine's new partner. * Betsy Brantley as Diane Pallone, a coroner and Caine's girlfriend. * Matthias Hues as Talec, an extraterrestrial drug dealer. * Jay Bilas as Azeck, an extraterrestrial police officer.

Contemporary reviews were generally negative. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it "stale through and through, derived from countless cop-buddy formula thrillers, drenched in violence and devoid of so much as a whiff of real life." Caryn James of The New York Times wrote, "This story turns out to be much more mundane than its outrageously clever premise." Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the film's imaginative weapons and humor make it an entertaining crowd-pleaser but criticized its cynical violence and lack of moral consciousness. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post compared it to Hardware and said its influences are more subtle, though it suffers from using too much humor. Chris Hicks of the Deseret News wrote that the film "isn't as bad as it has every right to be" and "provides some fun for fans of the genre". Lou Cedrone of The Baltimore Sun wrote, "Apart from the gore, I Come in Peace is an amusing mixture of action, science-fiction and comedy." Gary Thompson of the Philadelphia Daily News said that it is a better than usual rip-off of The Terminator with some original ideas. Time Out London wrote, "With an upbeat script and a healthy sense of humour, this is an unashamedly ridiculous affair with moderate ambitions and matching success." More recent reviews have been more enthusiastic. Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting rated it 4/5 stars and wrote that the film "is ripe for cult rediscovery." Anthony Arrigo of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and called it "one helluva fun time" and "a wildly entertaining, often brutal ride". Fred Topel of CraveOnline rated it 7/10 and wrote, "I Come In Peace is probably as good as it gets for theatrical leading man Dolph, and I highly recommend it." David Johnson of DVD Verdict called it "a gonzo slice of B-grade sci-fi tomfoolery". Ian Jane of DVD Talk rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote that "it's about as brainless as an action movie can get but you can't help but have fun with it." == Sequel == Co-star Matthias Hues lobbied for a sequel from the early 2000s until 2016. == See also == * Liquid Sky, a movie wherein an alien extracts endorphins from humans at the point of orgasm, killing them. * Not of This Earth == References == == External links == * * * * Category:1990 films Category:1990s buddy cop films Category:1990s science fiction action films Category:1990s chase films Category:American science fiction action films Category:American buddy cop films Category:American chase films Category:1990s English-language films Category:Films about drugs Category:Films about extraterrestrial life Category:Films directed by Craig R.
