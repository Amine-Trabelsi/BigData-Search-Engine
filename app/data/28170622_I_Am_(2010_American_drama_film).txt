I Am is a series of modern-day lessons from the Ten Commandments and was produced from a minimal budget by the creators and producers of the 'Liquid Series' in Los Angeles, Newport Beach, and Irvine, California, over various shooting days in 2008 and 2009. The feature film has been often described as a "Christian Crash" both by Hollywood executives and Christian pastors.Press release at christiancinema.com. == Cast == * Tomas Boykin as I Am * Jay Hindle as Lance Vita * John Ward as Aaron Rossdale * Todd Zeile as Trevor Evans * Stefan Hajek as Jake Russell * Amy Holland as Alice Bordeaux * Kate Bishop as Elaine * Greg Fisk as Dr. Ortus * Christinna Chauncey as Angelica Vita * Gary Edward as Selani * Laura McHenry as Eva * Josie Gammell as Lt.
