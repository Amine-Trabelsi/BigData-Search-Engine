I Can't Put My Finger on It is the second and last album by Miniature, drummer Joey Baron, saxophonist Tim Berne and cellist Hank Roberts, which was recorded in 1991 and released on the JMT label.Tim Berne discography, accessed October 14, 2014Shimada, T., JMT label discography, accessed October 14, 2014Hank Roberts discography , accessed October 14, 2014 ==Reception== The AllMusic review by Stephen Cook stated: "The result here is a corralled mix of bop, free jazz, soundtrack ambience, and funk, all wrapped in Berne's cerebrally swinging sound. And while not a substitute for one of Berne's or Baron's solo outings of the '90s, I Can't Put My Finger on It will still please fans of the New York downtown jazz sound."Cook, S., Allmusic Review accessed October 7, 2014 The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings praised the album, writing that it has the edge over the debut. ==Track listing== All compositions by Tim Berne except as indicated # "Zilla" - 2:34 # "Jersey Devil" (Hank Roberts) - 5:32 # "P.G.
